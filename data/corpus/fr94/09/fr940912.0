 This document makes final an interim rule that amended the pink bollworm regulations by removing Craighead, Cross,
Greene, Monroe, Poinsett, and St. Francis Counties in Arkansas, Concordia Parish in Louisiana, and Washington County
in Mississippi from the list of suppressive areas, and removing Louisiana and Mississippi from the list of States
quarantined because of the pink bollworm. The interim rule was necessary to relieve restrictions on the interstate
movement of regulated articles from certain previously regulated areas.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In an interim rule effective and published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 31, 1994 (59 FR 27965&hyph;27966, Docket No. 94&hyph;034&hyph;1), we amended the pink bollworm regulations
in 7 CFR part 301 by removing Craighead, Cross, Greene, Monroe, Poinsett, and St. Francis Counties in Arkansas; Concordia
Parish in Louisiana and Washington County in Mississippi from the list of suppressive areas in &sect;301.52&hyph;2a.
We also stated that the interim rule would remove Louisiana and Mississippi from the list of States quarantined to
prevent the spread of the pink bollworm since there would not be any areas in those States regulated because of the pink
bollworm. We stated that change would affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;301.52&hyph;2a; it should have stated it would affect &sect;301.52(a). However, we inadvertently left that
action out of the amendatory section of the interim rule. This final rule corrects that omission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments on the interim rule were required to be received on or before August 1, 1994. We did not receive any comments
by that date. The facts presented in the interim rule still provide a basis for the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action also affirms the information contained in the interim rule concerning Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory
Flexibility Act, Executive Orders 12372 and 12778, and the Paperwork Reduction Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, for this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived the review process required by Executive
Order 12866.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule modifies the minimum size requirements for all varieties of potatoes, except round reds, grown in
certain designated counties in Idaho, and Malheur County, Oregon, and for imported long type potatoes. Currently,
the minimum size requirement for all varieties, except round reds, is 2 inches in diameter, or 4 ounces in weight. This
rule specifies that, in addition, at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 percent of the potatoes in each lot, by weight, must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5 ounces or heavier. Requiring handlers to ship heavier potatoes should correct a marketing problem by providing
the heavier potatoes demanded by the market and increase returns to producers and handlers. As provided under the
Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, the changes will also apply to imported potatoes.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Marketing Order No. 945 [7 CFR part 945], as amended, hereinafter
referred to as the ``order,'' regulating the handling of Irish potatoes grown in certain designated counties in Idaho,
and Malheur County, Oregon. The order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended
[7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule, which also affects the import requirements for long type Irish potatoes, is also issued pursuant
to section 8e of the Act. The provisions of section 8e and the potato import regulation are discussed later in this final
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final has been reviewed under Executive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt
any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is not filed
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions
of import regulations issued under section 8e of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 60 handlers of Idaho-Eastern Oregon potatoes that are subject to regulation under the order,
and approximately 2,000 producers in the production area. In addition, at least 75 importers of Irish potatoes are
subject to import regulations and will be affected by this rule. Small agricultural service firms, which include
handlers of Idaho-Eastern Oregon potatoes, have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601]
as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural producers are defined as those whose
annual receipts are less than $500,000. A majority of these handlers and producers may be classified as small entities.
The majority of the importers of potatoes may also be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule amends paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of &sect;945.341 Handling regulation of the order's rules and regulations,
and is based on a unanimous recommendation made by the Idaho-Eastern Oregon Potato Committee (committee), the agency
responsible for local administration of the order, at its June 7, 1994, public meeting. The committee's recommended
revision is authorized pursuant to &sect;&sect;945.51 and 945.52 of the order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Quality assurance is very important to the Idaho-Eastern Oregon potato industry. Providing the public with acceptable
quality produce which is appealing to the consumer on a consistent basis is necessary to maintain buyer confidence
in the marketplace. The committee reports that potato size is important to buyers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For several decades, the minimum size requirement for all varieties of Idaho-Oregon potatoes, except round reds,
has been 2 inches in diameter, or 4 ounces in weight. However, the committee reports that the industry has been losing
its share of the potato market, because the market in recent years has been demanding potatoes larger than this minimum
size. Consumers now expect some baker size potatoes in the packages they buy. In spite of an industry campaign to encourage
handlers to voluntarily ship larger potatoes, a number of handlers have continued to ship potatoes that barely meet
the minimum size requirement, depressing the price for other potatoes. These potatoes are generally shipped in consumer
packs (e.g., 5- or 10-pound bags) or in 100-pound sacks for later repackaging into consumer packs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These shipments have resulted in disappointment by buyers and consumers in recent years, hurting the quality image
of Idaho-Eastern Oregon potatoes, reducing repeat purchases and overall sales volume, and resulting in declines
in prices, which has hurt the overall sales volume.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To better meet market demand regarding the size of potatoes, the committee recommended an additional requirement
that at least 40 percent of the potatoes in each lot must weigh at least 5 ounces. It is anticipated that requiring handlers
to ship such heavier potatoes will enable the industry to regain its lost share of the market and increase returns to
producers and handlers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 8e of the Act requires that when certain domestically produced commodities, including Irish potatoes, are
regulated under a Federal marketing order, imports of that commodity must meet the same or comparable grade, size,
quality, or maturity requirements, subject to concurrence by the U.S. Trade Representative. Section 8e also provides
that whenever two or more marketing orders regulating a commodity produced in different areas of the United States
are concurrently in effect, the Secretary shall determine which of the areas produces the commodity in more direct
competition with the imported commodity. Imports, then must meet the quality standards set for the particular area.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of potatoes, the current import regulation [7 CFR 980.1] specifies that import requirements for long type
potatoes be based on those in effect for potatoes grown in certain designated counties in Idaho, and Malheur County,
Oregon, during each month of the marketing year. While no changes are required in the language of section 980.1, imports
of long type potatoes would have to meet the increased minimum weight requirements proposed herein.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Applicability to imports
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is being removed from the handling regulations. That paragraph states the same information that is contained in section
980.1 of the import regulations. Since the same information applicable to imported potatoes is contained in the import
regulations, paragraph (i) in the domestic handling regulations is being deleted to eliminate duplication or confusion.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on available information, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule concerning this action was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 9, 1994 [59 FR 40477]. Comments on the proposed rule were invited from interested persons until August 24,
1994. No comments were received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all available information, it is found that the action, as hereinafter set forth, will tend
to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 8e of the Act, the United States Trade Representative has concurred with the issuance of
this final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date
of this action until 30 days after publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because: (1) This action was unanimously recommended by the Committee; (2) the new shipping season for the 1994&hyph;95
crop of Russet Burbanks began September 1, 1994, and this rule should be effective promptly to cover as many potatoes
of the 1994&hyph;95 crop as possible; and (3) the proposed rule provided a 15-day comment period and no comments were
received.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are adopting as a final rule, without change, an interim rule that amended the regulations concerning the importation
of horses by adding Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Finland, Guinea-Bissau, the Member States of the European Union,
Slovenia, The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and the nonrecognized areas of the former Yugoslavia (Montenegro
and Serbia) to the list of countries where contagious equine metritis (CEM) exists, and by adding Oman, Qatar, and
the United Arab Emirates to the list of countries considered to be affected with African horse sickness (AHS). Outbreaks
of CEM, a highly transmissible venereal disease, have been reported in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Finland,
Guinea-Bissau, Slovenia, The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and the nonrecognized areas of the former Yugoslavia
(Montenegro and Serbia). The Member States of the European Union either are affected with CEM or trade horses freely
with other Member States that are affected with CEM, without testing the horses for the disease. Oman, Qatar, and the
United Arab Emirates trade horses freely with other countries where AHS, a fatal viral disease, exists. The interim
rule imposed prohibitions or restrictions on the importation of horses that have been in these countries to protect
horses in the United States from CEM and AHS. Neither disease is known to exist in the United States.

 The Farm Credit Administration (FCA), by the Farm Credit Administration Board (Board), adopts interim regulations
that amend FCA regulations relating to collateral evaluation requirements for Farm Credit System (FCS or System)
institutions engaged in lending or leasing. The FCA Board also requests comments on these regulations. The amendments
respond to issues raised by regulatory revisions recently adopted by the other Federal financial institutions'
regulatory agencies (Federal regulatory agencies),

I. General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCA Board adopted final collateral evaluation regulations on November 12, 1992. The regulations were published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 20, 1992 (57 FR 54683), and became effective March 1, 1993. The regulations addressed the System's collateral
evaluation practices and procedures, including the need for: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Consistent methodology; (2) independence and controls; and (3) consistent educational and qualification requirements.
The regulations set basic requirements for real property appraisals, including the use of State licensed and/or
certified appraisers, functional independence, and compliance with Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal
Practices (USPAP). The real property appraisal requirements adopted were similar to the requirements of the other
Federal regulatory agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The objective of the present amendments is to provide additional flexibility in appraisal and independence requirements,
without jeopardizing the overall integrity or enforceability of the FCA's collateral evaluation regulations.
By providing additional flexibility in the use of State-sanctioned appraisers and relief from the more stringent
real estate appraisal requirements, the FCA addresses regulatory burden concerns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendments are being adopted as interim regulations with a delayed effective date and request for comments in
order to provide interested parties an opportunity to comment on the regulations. However, the FCA believes adopting
the regulations in final is required to provide System institutions with the necessary guidance to address revisions
to their collateral evaluation requirements and necessary staffing needs. The regulatory revisions also establish
requirements that are similar to the requirements recently adopted by the Federal regulatory agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA adopted, on May 5, 1994, a ``no action'' position relative to the System institutions' compliance with certain
real estate appraisal requirements in response to the then-pending regulatory revisions by the Federal regulatory
agencies. The FCA's ``no action'' position was intended to serve as a temporary means of eliminating any competitive
disadvantage suffered by System institutions. However, the ``no action'' position provides more flexibility than
the FCA would consider a prudent long-term regulatory position. Therefore, these regulatory revisions are intended
to eliminate any competitive disadvantage for the System institutions and establish the necessary guidance and
parameters for the System's collateral evaluation practices and procedures.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These revisions to the FCA's collateral evaluation regulations only address the issues associated with the real
estate appraisal requirements and do not lessen the overall requirements that have been established for the basic
collateral evaluation requirements or the collateral valuation process. The FCA Board is aware of the System's concern
about informational requirements for small loans. The FCA has received comments requesting consideration of guidance
for ``minimum information'' loan programs (including financial reporting and collateral evaluation information)
and related underwriting standards. The FCA believes these regulations provide flexibility to accommodate minimum
information loan programs. However, the FCA will consider these issues at a later date in response to the ``regulatory
burden'' notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on June 23, 1993 (58 FR 34003). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations also make technical revisions to part 614, subpart L, concerning credit denials and independent
appraisal requirements. Finally, the regulations reconcile FCA regulations pertaining to the release of collateral
evaluation information (part 618, subpart G), with the requirements of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act as interpreted
by Regulation B.

 The ECOA requires creditors to provide copies of real estate appraisals to applicants/borrowers when the appraisal
covers residential collateral. The Federal Reserve Board, on December 16, 1993, published final regulation revisions
(58 FR 65657) (Regulation B) implementing this requirement. Institutional compliance was required by June 14, 1994.

A. Bank and Thrift Federal Regulatory Agencies' Positions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 10, 1993, the four Federal regulatory agencies responsible for regulating banks and thrifts issued a joint
interagency statement that eased certain regulatory constraints on the availability of credit for small business
loans (including farm loans). The ``Interagency Policy Statement on Credit Availability'' (``Policy Statement'')
identified five areas of concern for possible regulatory and operational revisions. The five areas are: (1) Lending
to small- and medium-sized businesses; (2) real estate lending and appraisals; (3) appeals of examination decisions
and complaint handling; (4) examination processes and procedures; and (5) paperwork and regulatory burdens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While FCA was not a party to the Policy Statement released on March 10, 1993, it does have real property appraisal regulations
in place that are similar to those of the Federal regulatory agencies. In addition, the Policy Statement includes
farming operations as a segment of the small- and medium-sized businesses to be covered by any revisions arising from
the Policy Statement. Therefore, any change in the Federal regulatory agencies' real property appraisal requirements
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 will impact the FCA and the System in terms of the consistency and application of the collateral evaluation requirements.

The OCC, FDIC, FRB, and OTS jointly published revised real estate appraisal regulations on June 7, 1994 (59 FR 29482),
which were effective on that date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In discussing the real estate lending and appraisal concerns, the Policy Statement asserted that ``in some cases
currently required real estate appraisals may not add to the safety and soundness of the credit decision. Indeed,
in some cases, appraisals may prove so expensive that they make a sound small- or medium-sized business loan uneconomical.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 President Clinton directed the Federal regulatory agencies to review the existing real property appraisal regulations
and address changes as appropriate. The policy position implemented by the Federal regulatory agencies is considered
to be ``one aspect of an overall effort by the agencies to evaluate carefully and react appropriately to risk in the
United States financial services industry. That overall effort envisions substantial oversight; in some cases,
more than we have now, in areas that pose greater risk to the system. By the same token, regulatory burden will be reduced
where risk is low, especially for strong, well-managed banks and thrifts *&blank;*&blank;*.''

On June 4, 1993, the bank and thrift Federal regulatory agencies published proposed regulations (58 FR 31878) to amend
the existing real property appraisal regulations. On November 10, 1993, the Federal regulatory agencies solicited
additional comments on the database supporting the

B. FCA's Consideration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 10, 1993, the FCA Board adopted a policy position requesting public comment on possible regulatory burden
issues addressing a variety of subjects. This ``Regulatory Burden'' statement was published on June 23, 1993 (58
FR 34003). On July 15, 1993, the FCA Board directed staff to begin considering appropriate revisions of the FCA's regulations
and to monitor the progress of the regulatory revisions proposed by the Federal regulatory agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA received 15 comment letters in response to its regulatory burden statement from various System institutions
and related parties addressing collateral evaluation related issues. The commenters, in general, supported the
positions that had previously been proposed by the Federal regulatory agencies. The commenters also expressed concerns
with the inclusion of specific standards of the collateral evaluation regulations (i.e., general valuation and
personal property requirements) as well as specific requirements of part 614, subpart L, as they pertain to the appraisal
requirements for reconsideration of loan denials. In addition, the FCA has received two additional sets of comments
requesting that the FCA consider the positions proposed by the Federal regulatory agencies. The FCA responds to the
comments received in Section IV,

III. Historical Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCA has not identified any System institution that has failed solely because of poor or fraudulent appraisal activities.
However, there have been institutions that have failed where poor collateral evaluation practices have been a contributing
factor. A review of several of the institutions that failed during the 1980s has indicated that when such institutions
failed, they exhibited characteristics such as: (1) Poor credit administration practices; (2) poor internal controls;
(3) poor collateral evaluation practices; and (4) lack of credit expertise to handle increased debt levels and loan
volume. The majority of the institutions that failed or required some form of assistance did so because of losses experienced
in a few large, complex, and/or specialized loans. Poor collateral evaluation practices coupled with one or more
of the other characteristics described above contributed to the problems faced by the institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the implementation of the FCA's collateral evaluation regulations, the institutions have been required to
establish and implement appropriate collateral evaluation policies and procedures. Such policies and procedures
are needed to address collateral evaluation independence requirements and basic evaluation and appraisal standards,
as well as educational and qualification requirements. The development of such policies and procedures coupled
with appropriate internal controls, credit controls, and underwriting standards (i.e., lending limits, financial
and repayment analysis, loan inspections, etc.) will help ensure that past problems are not repeated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA's collateral evaluation regulations require that all System institutions will perform a collateral evaluation
on all secured loans and leases. Such collateral evaluations will take the form of a basic valuation or a more detailed
real estate appraisal, depending on the loan collateral and the specifics of the loan decision. The basic requirements
concerning individuals responsible for collateral evaluations address minimum education, qualification, independence,
and methodology standards that are either established by the regulation or must be established by the institution's
policies and procedures consistent with the requirements of the regulations.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The additional requirements for completion of real estate appraisals, including the use of State-sanctioned appraisers,
require a higher degree of independence and higher education and methodology standards. While higher standards
are desirable, it has been argued by the System, as well as by the banking and thrift industries, that universal application
of these higher standards and the additional cost involved do not add to the safety and soundness of these institutions.
They argue that such higher standards add unnecessary costs and delays to the credit process without providing a corresponding
reduction in loan defaults and losses in the institutions' smaller loans. The System and commercial banking institutions
further argue that collateral valuations completed by qualified and experienced persons, other than State licensed
or certified appraisers, are more appropriate and cost-effective for the majority of their loans and the associated
risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA believes that it is the responsibility of the institution to establish adequate policies and procedures for
collateral evaluations, taking into consideration the basic requirements of the FCA's regulations. The institutions
are responsible for determining the level of documentation required, depending on the size, complexity, and specialization
of the loan transaction. As an example, a $50,000 loan that qualifies for an institution's minimum information program
could require considerably less support, information, and documentation than a $500,000 loan to finance a large,
complex dairy operation not typical of the operations within an institution's territory. Under these revised regulations,
both loan transactions could qualify as collateral valuations rather than as real estate appraisals; but the complexity,
size, and specialization of the loan for the dairy operation would call for a higher degree of support information
development and documentation. The FCA notes that such flexibility already exists in the current regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The lending institution, not the collateral evaluator, is ultimately responsible for its credit decisions. The
collateral evaluation is only one of several factors that must be considered when making a credit decision. While
the collateral evaluation report must be completed by a qualified individual, institutions should not assume that
the acceptance of the collateral evaluation report substitutes for or completes the credit decision process. The
FCA expects the institutions to consider all relevant credit factors (including the collateral evaluation) as part
of the credit decision. If an institution is not comfortable with the reported value of the collateral, the institution
can request another evaluation, decrease the loan amount accordingly, or, provided other statutory and regulatory
requirements are satisfied, change the terms of the loan consideration in recognition of the perceived collateral
risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An institution need not lend 85 percent of the value shown by an evaluation. Rather it should limit the credit to the
amount that can be supported by consideration of the risk associated with all credit factors, including the collateral
evaluation. It is important to note that as the complexity or specialization of the subject property increases, the
degree of support documentation should also increase and should take into account the unique characteristics of
the property that make it complex or specialized.

IV. Regulatory Revisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Taking into account the comments received in response to the FCA's ``regulatory burden'' notice, the FCA staff studied
FCA's current collateral evaluation regulations, compared current regulations with those of the other Federal
regulatory agencies, and completed a study of data submitted to the FCA by the System. Based on its study, the FCA has
adopted the following positions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Increased Appraisal Thresholds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 levels on the appraisal requirements of the System institutions to $250,000. In addition, the threshold for the functional
independence requirements would also be increased in connection with the appraisal

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1992, the FCA completed an analysis to determine the segregation by size of the collateral securing the System's
loan portfolio. The database for the analysis included a summary of the number and volume of loans within the FCS banks
and associations as of December 31, 1991, that were unsecured, secured by personal property, secured by real property,
or secured by a combination of security types. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data were further segregated by loan-size categories. The FCA study has subsequently been updated to reflect
the December 31, 1992, and December 31, 1993, loan-size and collateralization information.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCA has also recently received the results of a study it commissioned through the University of Illinois to perform
independently of the development of these regulations (University of Illinois study). This study examined the loan
origination volume, associated defaults, and loan losses for a specific Farm Credit district for a period between
1973 and 1992 to determine, among other things, whether large loans have a higher default rate than small loans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Farm Credit Council, on behalf of the System institutions, has provided additional loan-size and
loan-loss data to the FCA for further consideration of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
level. Finally, the American Bankers Association (ABA) has also completed a survey,
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 which included a sample of 246 commercial banks of various sizes and portfolio structures. The survey stratified
the loan portfolios by loan size and by loan type (construction, farmland, multifamily, and nonfarm).

The total sample of the ABA survey consisted of 9,329 banks of various sizes with 51,931 loans reported for a total sample
volume of $22 billion (average size loan is $424,000, average size farmland loan is $83,900, and average commercial
loan is $820,000). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Upon review of the available data, the University of Illinois' study data, the System's data, and the ABA's commercial
bank data, several conclusions can be drawn. Each of the studies attempted to study the correlation between loan losses
and loan size. There appears to be very little difference in the average size of the ABA reported farmland loans and
the System institutions' loans. The establishment of a consistent threshold level would encompass similar percentages
of the farmland-based loan portfolio of System institutions and commercial banks. However, the System institutions
will have a greater percentage of farmland-based loan volume that would be in excess of a $250,000 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

level. An increase in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
level would result in the System institutions being afforded the same flexibility as the commercial lenders to perform
collateral valuations rather than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USPAP-based, State-sanctioned appraisals. This will result in a significant reduction in the number of loans that
would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require the use of a State-sanctioned appraiser
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 and thus result in cost savings to the borrowers/consumers. The System data indicate that the difference in the cost
of an appraisal versus a valuation averages approximately $300 per evaluation. Such reported cost differences are
consistent with cost data that have been reported by the commercial banking industry.

requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCA recognizes that increasing the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
level will reduce the number of transactions requiring a USPAP appraisal completed by a State-sanctioned appraiser.
The FCA's analysis of the available data suggested that for loans in excess of $250,000, the rate of loss justifies
the cost of the USPAP appraisal requirement, while for loans of less than $100,000, the cost of requiring USPAP appraisals
may exceed the volume of losses. For loans in the $100,000 to $250,000 range, the data do not clearly establish that
the rate of loss justifies the cost of requiring USPAP appraisals. Therefore, the FCA believes that a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
level of $250,000 is a reasonable point above which the additional appraisal requirements are justified. In addition,
the FCA is comfortable that safety and soundness concerns at or below $250,000 can be adequately addressed by the collateral
valuation requirements of the regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
 Business Loans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The regulations amend &sect;614.4260(b) to provide the System institutions with a $1.0 million threshold for requiring
appraisals for small- and medium-sized ``business loans'' where the loan repayment is not derived from the sale or
cash rental of real estate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this exemption is to provide greater flexibility for institutions to provide credit to small- and medium-sized
businesses where the owners are subject to the risk of operational losses. The exemption is not intended to ease credit
requirements for real estate investors or passive landowners. A $1.0 million exemption would be consistent with
the positions taken by the Federal regulatory agencies and will afford the System institutions a ``level playing
field'' with respect to the required use of State-sanctioned appraisers. Based on FCA's analysis of the data studies,
it should be noted that, in addition to the additional 15 percent (by number) of System loans exempted by the new $250,000
de minimis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
level exception, approximately an additional 5 percent of the number of loans will be exempted by the $1.0 million
``business loan'' exemption.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
However, within this $250,000 to the $1.0 million category, an additional 25 percent of loan volume will be exempted
by the new business loan exemption. These additional loans represent a significant proportion of System loan volume
and arguably pose significant additional risk for System institutions. Because of this concentration, the FCA has
provided additional criteria for the completion of collateral evaluations for such small- and medium-sized business
loans by requiring all real estate collateral evaluations in excess of $250,000, not otherwise exempted by &sect;614.4260(c),
to be completed in conformance with the USPAP. Such collateral evaluations of ``business loans,'' while conforming
with USPAP, will not necessitate the use of a State-sanctioned appraiser or compliance with the functional independence
requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the regulations allow institutions to use either a State licensed or State certified appraiser for loan transactions
under the $1.0 million level, the regulations require appraisals of real estate transactions over $1.0 million to
be completed by State certified appraisers. The FCA notes that this requirement is consistent with the requirements
of the Financial Institutions Recovery, Reform, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA),
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
11
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 which requires the use of a State certified appraiser for a real estate transaction appraisal of $1.0 million or more.

C. Additional Collateral

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations expand the exceptions for the use of State licensed and certified appraisers to include those instances
where the real estate is taken as additional collateral or where the loan is supported through conclusive documentation
of earnings capacity and repayment ability evidencing that the real estate is not necessary to support the loan decision.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adoption of the additional collateral exception and clarifying the ``abundance of caution'' exception gives System
institutions more flexibility in relying on collateral valuations of real property rather than USPAP-based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State-sanctioned appraisals. However, the FCA believes that the basic collateral valuation requirements and the
institutions' policies and procedures will provide sufficient analysis and detail to address any safety and soundness
concerns.

D. Limit Periodic Appraisals

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations amend &sect;614.4260(c) to permit the use of collateral valuations of real estate when a subsequent
transaction is related to the advancement of additional funds, a servicing action, loan reamortization, etc., provided
there has been no obvious and material change in the market conditions or physical aspects of the real estate that would
threaten the adequacy of the institution's real estate collateral protection after the transaction. The regulations
continue to require the institutions to develop appropriate policies and procedures addressing the circumstances
and frequency for the completion of real property appraisals versus collateral valuations, subject to the specific
requirements of the regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This revision would provide greater flexibility to the System institutions in determining the appropriate collateral
evaluation method to employ (valuation vs. appraisal) and the appropriate level of evaluator expertise required
in relation to the associated credit risk. This revision would allow institutions to use collateral valuations instead
of appraisals when a loan servicing action is required, a loan is being reamortized, or even when additional funds
are advanced as long as the collateral risk has not materially increased. This revision would also eliminate the requirement
that a new appraisal be completed if additional funds are advanced and an appraisal has not been completed within 2
years, as was previously required by the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These exemptions only address the use of real estate appraisals and are not intended to eliminate the need for a review
and update of the value of the collateral through the use of a collateral valuation. The FCA's regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(&sect;614.4260(c)(5)) would require a new evaluation for reamortizations of loans if there has been a material
increase in the associated risk in concert with the advancement of new funds. This position is consistent with the
requirements of the Federal regulatory agencies for transactions where new funds are advanced and there has been
a material increase in the associated risk. However, in addition, the FCA, based on safety and soundness concerns
identified in previous System practices, has taken the position that any loan servicing action (including reamortizations,
collateral releases, etc.) should be accompanied, at a minimum, by a collateral valuation that is consistent with
the requirements of these regulations.

E. USPAP ``Departure Provision'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations amend &sect;614.4265(h) to remove the prohibition on the use of the USPAP ``Departure Provision.''
The removal of the restriction will allow institutions to determine the best evaluation method to support the credit
decision consistent with safe and sound lending practices that also best serves the borrower. The elimination of
this restriction will also provide more flexibility for the institutions in the use of their appraiser resources
by allowing State licensed and certified appraisers to complete updated appraisals and collateral valuations that
would not otherwise meet the USPAP standards requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA and the Federal regulatory agencies originally included the restriction on the use of the ``departure provision''
because they were concerned that the use of the provision would result in an evaluation that is less than reliable.
However, upon further discussion and clarification from the Appraisal Foundation,
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 the Federal regulatory agencies now recognize that a ``departure provision'' appraisal provides the basic information
and valuation criteria required to ensure a reliable valuation process.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 Therefore, the prohibition on the use of the ``departure provision'' has been removed.

F. Technical Amendments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations make technical amendments to subpart F pertaining to issues such as an institution's review requirements
for appraisals completed by other financial institutions or government agencies. The FCA has eliminated the review
procedures from &sect;614.4255(d), because it is recognized that other U.S. Government agencies, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Government-Sponsored Enterprises and/or Federally regulated financial institutions are all guided in their appraisal
requirements by USPAP and FIRREA requirements, which are at least as encompassing as FCA's regulatory requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the regulations make technical amendments to part 614, subpart L, concerning an institution's responsibilities
for accepting an independent appraisal completed in response to a credit denial action. In addition, the regulations
make changes to part 618, subpart G, concerning an institution's obligation to provide applicants with copies of
collateral evaluations on residential properties as required by amended provisions of regulations implementing
the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters, responding to the FCA's ``Regulatory Burden'' notice, requested clarification as to the appropriateness
of providing time limits on how long an applicant can delay a credit reconsideration while waiting for the completion
of an independent appraisal. The FCA believes that this is a valid concern, which should be addressed by a revision
to the regulation to require the completion of the evaluation within a reasonable timeframe, depending on the nature
and complexity of the appraisal assignment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA has also noted that the Federal Reserve Board's amendment of Regulation B, the regulations that implement
the ECOA, requires that System institutions provide copies of collateral evaluation reports, containing all pertinent
information, to unsuccessful applicants for credit that would have been secured by residential real property. Therefore,
the FCA's current regulations pertaining to the release of information must be revised to expressly permit the release
of collateral evaluation information when required by the provisions of the ECOA and related regulations. The ECOA
regulations generally require the institution, in the case of residential properties, to provide the applicant
a copy of the complete evaluation report including any third-party information if it is used as part of the institution's
evaluation process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
System institutions should note that, in those cases where disclosure of such collateral evaluations is required
by the ECOA, there is no protection for confidential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third-party information. Therefore, System institutions should avoid the use of such confidential information
where disclosure is likely under the ECOA (i.e., loans secured by residential properties, including farmland loans
where a dwelling is taken as part of the security). Confidential third-party information does not include information
that would otherwise be publicly available (e.g., contained in the public land records).

G. Other Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters have expressed concerns with the level of requirements and standards for collateral valuations
on real estate and, in particular, the requirements for personal property valuations and the use of the income approach
for evaluations. The commenters objected to requirements they felt were not consistent with the requirements imposed
by the other regulators on their regulated banking institutions.

However, the General Accounting Office (GAO) has recently recommended that the bank and thrift Federal regulatory
agencies establish a set of minimum standards for real estate evaluations where the use of State-sanctioned appraisers
and compliance with USPAP are not required.

 The FCA, by previously adopting and publishing the requirements of &sect;614.4250 of the regulations, has addressed
similar concerns for the System institutions' valuation of real, personal, and intangible property in general.

In addition, the OCC has recently published proposed revisions to its lending limit regulations that would require
appraisals/evaluations of collateral used to secure loans where the lender requires collateral (including personal
property) to support lending in excess of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15-percent lending limit. This position is also consistent with the regulatory standards and guidance previously
established by the FCA in the collateral evaluation regulations. The FCA's willingness to adopt a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
25-percent lending limit for FCBs and direct lender associations is supported by the recognition that collateral
evaluation requirements serve as an essential control (58 FR 40311, July 28, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA has also reviewed concerns previously expressed by the System, which pertain to the required use of the income
approach for real estate evaluations in excess of the de minimis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
level (whether an appraisal is required or not). The FCA has clarified in the regulations that the income approach
is one of the three prescribed methods of valuing collateral under USPAP. Therefore, whenever USPAP standards are
employed the income approach must be considered. If it is not used as a valuation method, there must be an explanation
of why it was not used, accompanied by the development of the initial income-producing information to support its
lack of relevance as a valuation method. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;614.4265(d) the FCA requires the institution to develop and document, as part of the supporting information
for the credit analysis, the income-producing capacity of the subject real estate as well as the operations of the
business. This information may or may not be derived directly from the real estate evaluation process, but is required
as part of the credit analysis to support the debt repayment analysis. Such information is intended to assist in identifying
debt coverage shortages that must be addressed by other sources of income. However, the FCA strongly suggests that
the income approach be used on agricultural properties where the loan transaction exceeds the $250,000 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The income analysis requirement contained in the regulation does not apply to loan transactions at the $250,000 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
level and below. However, prudent business practices may dictate the development and use of such information in a
much wider range of loan transactions. The institutions have the responsibility to identify those instances where
the credit risk and the associated credit decision would require the support of the income and debt coverage analysis.

V. Summary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The present revisions of the FCA collateral evaluation requirements will benefit the System institutions by allowing
them to enjoy a competitive playing field with the commercial banking industry and relieving some requirements that
have been identified as burdensome and unnecessary. The FCA Board believes that these revisions can be made without
undermining the basic collateral evaluation requirements or jeopardizing safety and soundness. Therefore, the
FCA Board is able to increase the flexibility of the regulations in order to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency
of the System's collateral evaluation practices.

Sales comparison approach
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means the procedure that values property by comparing the subject property to similar properties located in relatively
close proximity, having similar size and utility, and having been recently sold in arm's-length transactions (comparable
sales). The sales comparison approach requires the evaluator to estimate the degree of similarity and difference
between the subject property and comparable sales. Such comparison shall be made on the basis of conditions of sale,
financing terms, market conditions, location, physical characteristics, and income characteristics. Appropriate
adjustments shall be made to the sales price of the comparable property based on the identified deficiencies or superiorities
of the subject property to arrive at a probable price for which the subject property could be sold on the date of the collateral
evaluation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The board of directors of each Farm Credit System institution that engages in lending or leasing secured by collateral
shall adopt well-defined and effective collateral evaluation policies and standards, that comply with the regulations
in this subpart, to ensure that collateral evaluations are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Sufficiently descriptive and detailed to provide ample support to the institution's related credit decisions;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Performed based on criteria established for the purpose of determining the circumstances under which collateral
evaluations will be required and when they will be required. Such criteria must, at a minimum: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Establish when an institution will require a collateral appraisal completed under the USPAP rather than a collateral
valuation; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Take into account such factors as market trends, market volatility, and various types of credit, loan servicing,
collection, and liquidation actions; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Completed by a qualified evaluator in an unbiased manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The policies and standards required by this section shall, at a minimum, address the criteria outlined in &sect;&sect;614.4250

 Collateral evaluation standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) When real, personal, or intangible property is taken as security for a loan or is the subject of a lease, an evaluation
of such property shall be performed in accordance with &sect;614.4260 and the institutions' policies and procedures.
Such a collateral evaluation shall be identified as either a collateral valuation or a collateral appraisal. Specifically,
all collateral evaluations must: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Value the subject property based upon market value as defined in &sect;614.4240(l); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Be presented in a written format; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Consider the purpose for which the property will be used and the property's highest and best use, if different from
the intended use; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Be sufficiently descriptive to enable the reader to ascertain the reasonableness of the estimated market value
and the rationale for the estimate; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Provide sufficient detail (including an identification and description of the property) and depth of analysis
to reflect the relevant characteristics and complexity of the subject property; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Analyze and report, as appropriate, for real, intangible, and/or personal property, on: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The current income producing capacity of the property; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A reasonable marketing period for the property; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The current market conditions and trends that will affect projected income, to the extent such conditions will
affect the value of the property; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The appropriate deductions and discounts as they would apply to the property, including but not limited to, those
based on the condition of the property, as well as the specialization of the operation and property; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Potential liabilities, including those associated with any hazardous waste or other environmental concerns;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Include in the evaluation report a certification that the evaluation was not based on a requested minimum valuation
or specific valuation or approval of a loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) For purposes of determining appraisal value as required in section 1.10(a) of the Act, the definition of market
value and the requirements of this subpart shall apply.

Independent collateral evaluations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) An applicant for a loan that has been denied may, as part of the request for a review, request an independent collateral
evaluation by an independent evaluator, as defined in &sect;614.4440 of this subpart, of any interests in property
securing the loan (other than the stock or participation certificates of the lender held by the borrower). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Within 30 days after a request for a collateral evaluation, the credit review committee shall present the applicant
or borrower with a list of three independent evaluators approved by the qualified lender. The borrower shall select
and engage the services of an evaluator from the list to perform the collateral evaluation. The collateral evaluation
must be completed within a reasonable period of time. The cost of the evaluation shall be borne by the applicant or borrower.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The credit review committee shall consider the results of any such collateral evaluation in any final determination
with respect to the loan or restructuring, provided the applicant's or borrower's evaluator has provided a copy of
the evaluation report to the lender not less than 15 business days prior to any scheduled meeting of the credit review
committee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Any such collateral evaluations that are not completed in conformance with the collateral evaluation requirements
described in subpart F of this part, relative to collateral evaluation standards, independence requirements, and
qualification requirements, need not be considered by the credit review committee. To facilitate the proper completion
of such collateral evaluations, a copy of part 614, subpart F, shall be provided to the borrower for presentation to
the borrower's evaluator, and a copy signed by the borrower's evaluator shall be a required exhibit in the subsequent
evaluation report.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Farm Credit Administration (FCA), by the FCA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Board, adopts new final regulations governing the Farm 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Credit System's (FCS or System) preparation and reporting of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Systemwide financial information to investors. The final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule requires that each bank of the System, the Federal Farm 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Credit Banks Funding Corporation (Funding Corporation), and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Farm Credit System Financial Assistance Corporation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Financial Assistance Corporation) jointly publish periodic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports to investors and potential investors in Systemwide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
debt obligations and consolidated bank debt obligations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Farm Credit System (FCS debt obligations). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the rule is to ensure that timely and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accurate Systemwide financial information continues to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disclosed to investors and the public to assist them in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
making informed decisions regarding FCS debt obligations and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
System institutions. The required report to investors must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present Systemwide combined financial statements, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplemental financial statement information, and related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyses pertaining to System institutions on a combined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis. The final rule covers Systemwide financial and non-financial information now regularly disclosed by the
Funding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corporation in annual and quarterly information statements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and press releases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final regulations generally parallel the existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Farm Credit System Disclosure Program (System Disclosure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program) and should not impose any significant additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burdens on System institutions. Consistent with the System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Disclosure Program, the final rule preserves the existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting relationship between a System bank and its related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the System Disclosure Program, the Funding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corporation, on behalf of the System, periodically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distributes to investors a disclosure document containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Systemwide financial information. The System institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that participate in the System Disclosure Program (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each of the System banks, the Funding Corporation, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Financial Assistance Corporation
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
) jointly publish the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Report to Investors of the Farm Credit System (FCS Report) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on an annual basis. The FCS Report includes an Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Statement and a general report. The Information Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contains combined financial statements and related analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pertaining to all System institutions. The general report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contains other information about the System, its debt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obligations, and the environment in which it operates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Except for the quarter that coincides with the end of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fiscal year, System institutions also jointly publish a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quarterly Information Statement. In connection with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sale of debt securities, the Funding Corporation routinely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distributes the FCS Report and quarterly Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Statement to the investment dealers and dealer banks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(selling group) that sell FCS debt securities. The FCA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently has no regulations that specifically govern the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
System's disclosure of Systemwide financial information to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investors.

II. Statutory Authority and Proposed Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 5.17(a)(8) of the Farm Credit Act of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1971, as amended (1971 Act), 12 U.S.C. 2252(a)(8), the FCA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is authorized to ``Regulate the preparation by System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions and the dissemination to stockholders and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investors of information on the financial condition and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations of such institutions. *&blank;*&blank;*'' On February 4, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994, the FCA proposed regulations for a new part 630, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Disclosure to Investors in Systemwide and Consolidated Bank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Debt Obligations of the Farm Credit System, to govern the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
System's preparation and reporting of Systemwide financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information to investors. (59 FR 5341) In general, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulations reflected the current division of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibilities among the institutions participating in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
System Disclosure Program, and included requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disclosures similar to those contained in the Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Statements currently published by the System. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions participating in the System Disclosure Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were designated as the ``disclosure entities'' in the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, in recognition of their shared responsibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for disclosure of Systemwide financial information to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investors and the general public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Discussion of the Final Rule and Summary of Public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCA is adopting part 630 largely as proposed. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule includes changes and clarifications to address 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments received on the proposed rule. As in the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, the final regulations (1) Require the System to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
publish annual and quarterly reports to investors; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) delineate responsibilities relating to the preparation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the report; (3) reinforce internal controls over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Systemwide financial disclosure; and (4) establish reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards for the report to ensure that relevant information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerning the combined financial condition and results of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations of the System is disclosed to investors and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential investors. The final rule will prevent any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inconsistency between Systemwide disclosure to investors and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FCA regulations governing accounting and reporting standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and individual System institution disclosure to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shareholders. These new FCA regulations will apply to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information currently contained in the System's Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Statements and press releases that contain Systemwide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial information. The final rule also implements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 514 of the Farm Credit Banks and Associations Safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Soundness Act of 1992, Pub. L. 102&hyph;552 (1992 Act), which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires adequate disclosure to investors of financial and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conflict-of-interest information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final regulations will ensure that timely and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accurate Systemwide financial information continues to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disclosed to investors and the public to assist them in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
making informed decisions regarding FCS debt obligations and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
System institutions. This is consistent with the FCA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Board's regulatory policy to ``Protect the public, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investors, and the customer/shareholders of the System in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effort to create an environment whereby 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
customer/shareholders and investors can take advantage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the System's strength and rely on its future viability with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confidence.'' (

FCA Board Policy Statement on Regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Philosophy, 59 FR 32189, June 22, 1994) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA received six comment letters on the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations during the comment period, which expired on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
April 20, 1994. One letter was submitted by the Farm Credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Council (FCC) on behalf of its membership. The FCC comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were the product of input from a number of sources, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including System banks, the System's Accounting Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Work Group, and the Funding Corporation. The FCC recognized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and concurred with the FCA's efforts to ensure that timely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and accurate Systemwide financial information continues to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be disclosed to investors and potential investors in FCS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
debt securities. Noting the System's general support for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed regulations, the FCC submitted comments on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
several provisions of the proposed regulations in the body 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of its letter and provided technical comments on other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions in an attached appendix. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Funding Corporation, the Farm Credit Bank of Texas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(FCBT), and the Farm Credit Bank of Baltimore (FCBB) each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted a letter addressing specific issues. The Funding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corporation commented concerning its access to FCA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Examination Reports of System banks and associations. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FCBT addressed the same issue in its letter. In addition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the FCBT urged that the FCA prohibit directors of System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions from serving on the System Audit Committee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While endorsing the comments submitted by the FCC, the FCBB 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
urged that the FCA clarify, for purposes of Systemwide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disclosure, the treatment of the FCBB's wholly-owned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsidiary, the Farm Credit Finance Corporation of Puerto 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rico. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(AICPA) and Price Waterhouse, the external auditor currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engaged to provide an opinion on the Systemwide combined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial statements, also commented on the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. Both of these commenters suggested that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for an accountant's opinion on supplemental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information be clarified. The AICPA also commented on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issues concerning the definition of ``material,'' the due 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dates of the reports to investors, and the requirement for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filing a letter with the FCA explaining the preferability of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an accounting change.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After the FCA published the proposed rule, the General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accounting Office (GAO) issued a report entitled ``Farm 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Credit System: Repayment of Federal Assistance and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Competitive Position'' (GAO/GGD&hyph;94&hyph;39, dated March 10, 1994), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which recommended that the FCA require the System to exclude 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Farm Credit Insurance Fund (Insurance Fund) from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
System's combined financial statements because of the GAO's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
view that exclusion is the most appropriate accounting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment. On May 10, 1994, the FCA responded to the GAO's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendation in a letter to Congressional committees which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described the FCA's approach to Insurance Fund reporting as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflected in this rulemaking. The final regulations require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the System prepare the Systemwide combined financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principles (GAAP), provide supplemental financial statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data with and without the Insurance Fund, and give a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thorough discussion and analysis of the fund in the report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to investors. The FCA believes that these regulations, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted, will ensure that investors are provided with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meaningful information regarding the Insurance Fund and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect of the fund on the System's financial position. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Provided below are a section-by-section analysis of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes to the proposed rule and FCA responses to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments received.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Section 630.2(b) and (h)_Definitions of ``Combined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Financial Statements'' and ``Systemwide Combined Financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Statements'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For preparation of the Systemwide combined financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statements, the final rule requires that each bank provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Funding Corporation with bank-only financial data as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
well as with combined financial data of the bank and its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
related associations. The FCC and the FCBB commented that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed regulations should be clarified to address how 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the consolidated financial data of a bank and its wholly-owned subsidiaries should be reported in the Systemwide

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disclosure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To distinguish financial data prepared on a combined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis from that prepared on a consolidated basis, a new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of ``combined financial statements'' has been added 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in &sect;630.2(b) of the final rule. The definition is added to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clarify that combined financial statements are prepared by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
group of affiliated entities that share the same financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest regardless of whether any of the entities has the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ability to exercise control over another. In contrast, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consolidated financial statements are prepared by a parent-entity to include the financial data of subsidiaries
that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are under its ``control.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To prevent this newly added definition of ``combined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial statements'' from being confused with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of ``Systemwide combined financial statements'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contained in &sect;630.2(g) of the proposed rule, proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;630.2(g) has been simplified to define ``Systemwide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combined financial statements'' as the combined financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statements required by this part. Proposed &sect;630.2(g) also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is redesignated as &sect;630.2(h). The proposed language 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifying the purpose for which the Systemwide combined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial statements are prepared has been moved and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combined with provisions pertinent to financial statements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in &sect;630.20(l).

2. Proposed Definition of ``Material'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 630.2(f) of the proposed regulations provided a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of ``material'' similar to that found in Securities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 405. The FCA received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two comments on the proposed definition of ``material.'' The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AICPA asserted that defining ``material'' other than as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established in accounting literature would be confusing and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inconsistent if audits of the Systemwide combined financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statements are required to be performed in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS). The AICPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended either deleting the proposed definition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``material'' or amending it to refer to the materiality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition in GAAS or in Financial Accounting Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Board Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No. 2, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Qualitative Characteristics of Accounting Information (FAC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No. 2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA notes that the definition of ``material'' in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule was intended to govern information presented 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outside the basic financial statements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Regardless of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed definition, the Systemwide combined financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statements required by this part are subject to materiality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria established in GAAP. Specifically, pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;630.3(c),
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the Systemwide combined financial statements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be prepared in accordance with the accounting and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting standards set forth in part 621 of this chapter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because &sect;621.2(g) defines the term ``material'' in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with FAC No. 2, the GAAP definition of ``material'' contained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in part 621 of this chapter will govern the System's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation of Systemwide combined financial statements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, materiality judgments for preparation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Systemwide combined financial statements must be made in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with GAAP.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCC recommended that the proposed definition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``material'' be expanded to recognize the different levels of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting and disclosure responsibilities of the System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
banks and the Funding Corporation. The FCC suggested two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate definitions of ``material.'' One of the suggested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definitions would apply to the Banks' reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibilities to the Funding Corporation and the second 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would apply to the Funding Corporation's disclosure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibilities on a Systemwide basis as subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antifraud provisions of the Federal securities laws. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under GAAP, individual materiality judgments are made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on a case-by-case basis and materiality is measured at each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting level in light of surrounding circumstances. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GAAP position is supported by FAC No. 2 and recognizes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no general standards of materiality could be formulated to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
take into account all the considerations that enter into an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experienced human judgment. In line with this approach to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the concept of materiality, the FCA believes that it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unnecessary to include, as suggested by the FCC, two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate definitions of ``material.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Materiality judgments regarding information presented 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outside the financial statements, while not covered by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GAAP definition, are governed by current standards of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materiality under the securities laws.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 The FCA believes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the case law standard of materiality provides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient guidance to the System in preparing information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be presented outside the financial statements. To avoid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any confusion between the GAAP materiality standard which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governs preparation of the financial statements, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard of materiality enunciated in the case law, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governs information presented outside of the financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statements, the proposed definition of ``material'' has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eliminated from the final rule.

3. Section 630.2(g)_Definition of ``Report to Investors'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCC commented that, although the preamble clarifies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the term ``report to investors'' used throughout the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule is intended to mean the Information Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently published by the Funding Corporation, confusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exists as to whether the term refers to the FCS Report or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Information Statement. Because the FCS Report currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared by the Funding Corporation contains certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information that is not part of the System Disclosure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program, and for which System banks are not responsible, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FCC suggested that all references to the ``report to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investors'' in the regulation be replaced with the term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Information Statement.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA does not intend to regulate the name of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report required by this part. The term ``report to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investors'' used in the proposed rule is merely a general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference to the disclosure document required by this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, in response to the FCC's comment, a new definition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of ``report to investors'' has been added as &sect;630.2(g) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule to clarify that the term ``report to investors'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referred to in the regulations means ``a report that presents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Systemwide combined financial statements, supplemental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial statement information, and related financial and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonfinancial information pertaining to the System required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by this part.'' Under this provision, a document containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only information that is not required by this part and that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is clearly identified as separate from the required report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not be subject to this final rule.

B. Section 630.3_Publishing and Filing the Report to Investors
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Section 630.3(a) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCA received two comments on &sect;630.3(a), which establishes the due dates for publishing the annual and quarterly
reports to investors. The FCC opined that the word ``publish'' in &sect;630.3(a) is subject to interpretation, and
could mean printed, mailed, or received by the investors. The commenter suggested that the word ``publish'' be replaced
with the phrase ``make available.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 630.3(a) requires not only that the System ``make available'' the report to investors by the dates specified
in &sect;630.3(a)(1) and (a)(2) but that the System take affirmative steps to distribute the report to investors.
One such step, as noted in the rule proposal, is distribution of sufficient copies of the report to the selling group
dealers for subsequent distribution to interested investors. The FCA believes that the suggested substitution
of the phrase ``make available'' may discourage exploration of other report distribution techniques and, accordingly,
has retained the word ``publish'' in &sect;630.3(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AICPA also commented on &sect;630.3(a), suggesting that the FCA reconsider whether the due dates prescribed
in &sect;630.3(a) provide sufficient time for preparation of the combined information from various entities within
the System. The FCA believes that the due dates established in &sect;630.3(a) for publishing and filing an annual
report within 90 days after the end of each fiscal year and a quarterly report within 60 days after the end of each reporting
quarter are adequate. The 90-day requirement for publishing the annual report to investors is consistent with industry
practice. The 60-day requirement for publishing the quarterly report permits the Funding Corporation to publish
the report 15 days after the constituent System banks and associations have filed their quarterly reports with the
FCA pursuant to part 620 of this chapter. In addition, in the event the Funding Corporation is unable to prepare and
publish the report to investors because one or more banks fail to fulfill their responsibilities for providing information
to the Funding Corporation in accordance with &sect;630.4(c), &sect;630.4(a)(7) authorizes the Funding Corporation
to request the FCA to extend the due date for publishing the report to investors. Accordingly, the FCA has adopted the
due dates established in &sect;630.3(a) as proposed.

2. Section 630.3(f)_Banks' Joint and Several Liability for Consolidated Bank Debt Obligations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 630.3(f) requires that each report to investors include a statement that Systemwide debt securities and
consolidated bank debt obligations are joint and several liabilities of individual banks. The FCC questioned the
statutory basis for this required statement as regards individual bank joint and several liability for consolidated
bank debt obligations. The FCC requested that the FCA provide a legal analysis of the statutory basis and extend the
comment period for this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA believes that no extensive analysis is required to justify the position that consolidated bank debt obligations
are joint and several liabilities of individual banks. The basis for this disclosure is found in section 4.4 of the
1971 Act, which clearly establishes joint and several liability of all banks for consolidated and Systemwide debt
regardless of the title of the 1971 Act under which the bank operates. The FCA notes that the 75-day comment period on
these regulations included a 30-day extension of the original comment period and believes that another extension
of the comment period is unnecessary. The FCA has adopted &sect;630.3(f) as proposed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;630.4(a)(9) authorizes the Funding Corporation to make a request to the FCA regarding the content
of the latest Reports of Examination of any banks and related associations if the information is necessary for preparation
of the report to investors. Two System institutions_the Funding Corporation and the FCBT_commented on the proposed
provision.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Funding Corporation suggested that the regulation be expanded so that, upon its request, each bank would be required
to provide the Funding Corporation with the Reports of Examination and related information for the bank and related
associations. The Funding Corporation is concerned that the regulation as proposed may be interpreted to implicitly
absolve a bank of its responsibility to report to the Funding Corporation any significant regulatory conditions
imposed or actions taken by the FCA against the bank or its related associations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conversely, the FCBT supported proposed &sect;630.4(a)(9) as written on the basis that it maintains an appropriate
balance between the confidentiality of examination reports required by &sect;602.205 of this chapter and the need
to provide complete and accurate disclosure to investors required by the proposed rule. Section 630.4(c) sets forth
the responsibilities of each bank for preparation of the report to investors. Based on &sect;630.4(c)(5)(i), which
requires that each bank certify to the Funding Corporation that the bank has submitted all information needed for
preparation of the report to investors in accordance with the instruction of the Funding Corporation, the FCBT concluded
that protection of the confidentiality of examination reports will not encourage banks to avoid their primary disclosure
responsibilities with respect to material matters that may be discussed in the examination report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the FCBT supports &sect;630.4(a)(9) as proposed, it commented that the phrase ``if necessary'' leaves doubt
as to whether the Funding Corporation should request the FCA to provide information contained in the examination
reports in all cases or simply in those cases where a bank does not provide information contained in the examination
report to the Funding Corporation. The FCBT requested that the FCA provide a definitive and unambiguous rule regarding
the obligation to furnish copies of these reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the comments received, the FCA has revised paragraphs (a)(2)(ii), (a)(3), and (a)(9) of &sect;630.4
to clarify that the Funding Corporation is responsible for collecting from each disclosure entity information needed
for preparation of the report to investors, including any information that is material to a single disclosure entity.
Likewise, in accordance with the Funding Corporation's instructions, each bank is responsible for providing the
Funding Corporation with information that is material either to the bank or, on a combined basis, to the bank and its
related associations. If information necessary for preparation of a report to investors that is meaningful and not
misleading is not forthcoming from a bank in accordance with the provisions of &sect;630.4(c), the Funding Corporation
may request the FCA to provide information regarding the content of the latest Reports of Examination of any banks
or related associations necessary to ensure that the information presented in the report to investors is meaningful
and not misleading. The FCA will then make a determination whether to provide the Funding Corporation with relevant
information contained in the Report of Examination or, if appropriate, the entire report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA is cognizant of both the Funding Corporation's desire to have direct access to Reports of Examination and the
FCBT's concern with protection of the confidentiality of the Reports of Examination. The FCA does not believe that
&sect;630.4(a)(9) would relieve a bank of its responsibility to report any significant regulatory conditions that
would have a material impact on the information being presented in the report to investors. It remains the primary
responsibility of each bank to provide accurate and complete information to the Funding Corporation for preparing
disclosure to investors. Each bank is required to certify to this effect to the Funding Corporation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 630.4(a)(9) is established to provide the Funding Corporation with a contingency source for obtaining information
needed to prepare accurate and comprehensive annual and quarterly reports to investors, while maintaining the confidentiality
of the Reports of Examination. However, such requests from the Funding Corporation to the FCA are expected to be rare.
Also, as the FCBT noted in its comment letter, &sect;630.5 prohibits banks from making incomplete, inaccurate, or
misleading disclosures. Failure to disclose material information would violate these regulations and subject
a bank and its officers and directors to possible FCA enforcement action.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 630.4(c)(1) requires that each bank provide the Funding Corporation with information needed for preparation
of the report to investors. The FCC suggested that proposed &sect;630.4(c)(1) be revised to clarify that, for Systemwide
disclosure, information to be provided by each bank to the Funding Corporation includes not only financial information,
but nonfinancial information as well, including information covering structural changes and regulatory enforcement
activity. Proposed &sect;630.4(c)(1) has been clarified to refer to other nonfinancial information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCC also suggested that proposed &sect;&sect;630.4(c)(1) and 630.20(m)(3)(i) be revised to clarify that it
is appropriate to include any wholly-owned subsidiary of a bank in the bank-only information. The FCBB submitted
a separate comment in which it urged the FCA to include the FCC's suggestion in the final rule to address the treatment
of the Farm Credit Finance Corporation of Puerto Rico, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the FCBB.

To address the concerns raised by the commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding a bank's reporting of consolidated financial data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in Systemwide disclosure, the FCA has removed the wording 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``bank-only'' from &sect;630.4(c)(1) and clarified that, if a bank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with GAAP, it is appropriate that the bank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide consolidated financial data of the bank and its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consolidated subsidiaries to the Funding Corporation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conforming changes were also made to &sect;630.20(m)(3) and

3. Section 630.4(d)_Responsibilities of Associations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;630.4(d) provides the banks with access to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their related associations' auditors for preparation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report to investors. The FCC commented that the banks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sometimes may need to have access to others, such as legal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
counsel. To ensure that the banks have the ability to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtain any information necessary to accurately prepare their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submission to the Funding Corporation, the FCC suggested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the regulation include a general statement that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
banks may have access to any material association 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information. Under sections 2.2 and 2.12 of the 1971 Act, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each association is subject to supervision by its related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bank. Each Farm Credit Bank is responsible for preparing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the combined financial statements of the bank and related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associations for disclosure to shareholders pursuant to part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
620 of this chapter. Part 620 of this chapter does not, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however, specify how the disclosure responsibilities between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
banks and related associations are shared. To clarify this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue for purposes of part 630, the FCA has expanded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed &sect;630.4(d) by adding a general statement in &sect;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
630.4(d)(1) of the final rule to require that each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
association provide its related bank with the information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to allow the bank to provide accurate and complete 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information to the Funding Corporation for preparation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the report to investors. The original text of proposed &sect;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
630.4(d) has been redesignated as &sect;630.4(d)(2).

D. Section 630.5_Prohibition Against Incomplete,

Inaccurate, or Misleading Disclosure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCC suggested that the FCA clarify that &sect;630.5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerning prohibition against incomplete, inaccurate, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misleading disclosure would apply only when the defective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disclosure is material. Since compliance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disclosure standards of this part is generally subject to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materiality test in any event, the FCA finds it unnecessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to add the suggested materiality language to &sect;630.5 and has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted this section as proposed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Section 630.6(a)(2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under &sect;630.6(a)(2), officers or employees of a System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution are prohibited from serving on the System Audit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Committee (SAC) because they are not independent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management. The FCBT urged the FCA to prohibit System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directors from serving on the SAC due to potential conflicts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of interest based on competition between System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA believes that the suggested prohibition would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be disruptive to the existing SAC and force the Funding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corporation to recruit SAC members from outside the System. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the FCA views the FCBT's argument as relating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less to conflict of interest than to concern regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preservation of the confidentiality of information reviewed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the SAC. Under section 4.9 of the 1971 Act, directors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and management of System institutions are eligible to serve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the board of the Funding Corporation. As a practical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
matter, any information available to SAC members is equally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available to the members of the board of the Funding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corporation. Thus, precluding System directors from serving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the SAC would not necessarily prevent confidential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information from being exposed to directors of other System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
banks. In light of these considerations, the FCA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopting the rule as proposed but will monitor SAC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities for apparent inappropriate use of information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the FCA notes that &sect;630.6(a) does not prevent the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Funding Corporation board from adopting a policy to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disqualify System directors from serving on the SAC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

2. Section 630.6(a)(4)(iii) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCC commented that the word ``approve'' contained in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;630.6(a)(4)(iii) of the proposed rule implies that the SAC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has the authority to dictate individual bank accounting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policies or that the Funding Corporation has the authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to require banks to uniformly and consistently adopt or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change accounting policies. This was not the intent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule. The primary duty of the SAC is to ensure the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
integrity of the report to investors jointly prepared by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Funding Corporation and System banks. The SAC is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsible for overseeing the reporting process and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
internal controls implemented by the Funding Corporation for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation of the System's report to investors. To clarify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that neither the SAC nor the Funding Corporation is charged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the responsibility for dictating individual banks' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accounting polices, the FCA has substituted the word 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``review'' for the word ``approve'' as suggested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Section 630.6(a)(4)(iv) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under proposed &sect;630.6(a)(4)(iv), the SAC is required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to review each disclosure document containing Systemwide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information prescribed in this part, including annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports, quarterly reports, and press releases, prior to its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
release. The FCC commented that the SAC's responsibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should pertain only to financial information and disclosures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contained in the annual information statements because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SAC generally would not have the expertise to review and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluate nonfinancial information, such as is found in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
description of business and description of debt securities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCC also suggested that, to facilitate timely issuance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of quarterly information, the requirement for a review of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each quarterly report or press release by the SAC prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its release be eliminated.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To ensure the quality of the report to investors, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FCA believes that each annual or quarterly report should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reviewed by the SAC in its entirety. Under &sect;630.6(a)(2), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which provides that ``members shall be knowledgeable in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public and corporate finance and financial reporting and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disclosure,'' members selected to serve on the SAC should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have the expertise to review the entire report to investors, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including both financial and nonfinancial information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the FCA agrees that the essence of press releases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is to provide timely release of interim information and has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deleted the requirement for a review of press releases by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the SAC from &sect;630.6(a)(4)(iv). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Section 630.6(a)(4)(v) and (b)(3)(ii) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCC suggested that the word ``oversee'' contained in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed &sect;630.6(a)(4)(v) and (b)(3)(ii) regarding the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility of the SAC and the bank audit committee be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replaced with the word ``review'' because the proposed wording 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implies that the audit committee would perform a management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
function in the System or the bank. The FCC also suggested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other changes to proposed &sect;630.6(a)(4)(v) to avoid this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implication. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The audit committee is commonly recognized as an entity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established to perform an oversight function in the areas of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial reporting, internal control, and corporate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governance. The word ``oversee'' contained in the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule is consistent with the customary role of audit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
committees. The FCA has retained the word ``oversee'' in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;630.6(a)(4)(v) and (b)(3)(ii). The FCA notes that it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the responsibility of the board of each System institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to determine the steps the audit committee should perform to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fulfill its oversight responsibilities. Thus, the boards of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual System institutions could charter their audit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
committee to review and direct management to take necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrective actions or merely to review and make corrective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendations to the board.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCC suggested that the proposed &sect;630.20(c)(2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disclosure requirement for a summary of FCA enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions against individual institutions be clarified and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that any required discussion of the impact of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcement actions on the System's operations be linked to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materiality. The FCA agrees with this suggestion and has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised the language of &sect;630.20(c)(2) of the final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordingly.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCC expressed the view that the information called 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for by &sect;630.20(d)(1) regarding System debt obligations is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
too detailed and, thus, impractical. Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
630.20(d)(1)(ii) is, in large part, based upon the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disclosure currently furnished by the System in its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information Statements. Unless otherwise needed to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
readers of the report to investors with information needed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to understand the characteristics of System debt, the FCA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not expect extensive detail regarding the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characteristics of specific debt offerings. To clarify this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
position, the FCA has deleted the words ``terms and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions'' and added prefatory language to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;630.20(d)(1)(ii) requiring a description of debt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obligations statutorily authorized to be issued and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently issued by the System, as well as other pertinent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCC also requested that the regulation clearly set 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forth the option of incorporating by reference the annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and quarterly reports to investors into specific offering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documents. The FCA notes that the focus of this regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is on periodic reports of the System to investors. It does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not govern offering circulars or specific offering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documents. Nothing in this regulation precludes the System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from incorporating by reference information contained in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annual or quarterly reports to investors into specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offering documents if otherwise appropriate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;630.20(g)(1)(ii) required disclosure of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of loans outstanding that were used to finance the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchases of stock or other equities of System institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCC expressed concern regarding the System's ability to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comply with this requirement and questioned its relevance to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investors. The FCC opined that disclosures currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided by the System in its annual Information Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are sufficient. The System's 1993 annual Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Statement states that association borrowers do not typically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchase capital stock for cash, but instead add the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aggregate par value of stock to the principal amount of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
related loan obligation. The 1993 report also provided the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of capital stock and participation certificates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outstanding at December 31, 1993. The FCC indicated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
System compliance with the proposed requirement could only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be on a prospective basis because System banks do not have a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system in place to track needed information. Further, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FCC argued that the costs involved in complying with this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed requirement would outweigh the benefits derived 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the disclosure.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCA supports the commenter's view that the cost involved in providing meaningful information to investors should
not outweigh the benefits derived. The FCA also notes that &sect;630.20(e)(2), which requires the System to ``describe
the statutory requirement that a borrower purchase stock as a condition of obtaining a loan; how such stock is purchased,
transferred, and retired; and how earnings are distributed,'' will ensure that investors continue to receive information
that describes the nature of borrower stock of the System. As a result, proposed &sect;630.20(g)(1)(ii) has been
deleted from the final rule and proposed &sect;630.20(g)(1)(iii) and (iv) have been redesignated.

4. Section 630.20(g)(1)(ii)_Risk Exposure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;630.20(g)(1)(iii) requires discussion and analysis of the risk exposure of the loan portfolio.
The FCC suggested that the term ``nonperforming loans'' replace the term ``high-risk assets'' in this section of
the regulation because it is more widely used in the commercial banking industry. Use of the term ``high-risk assets''
in proposed &sect;630.20(g)(1)(iii) is consistent with the recent amendment of the FCA's accounting and reporting
guidelines in part 621 of this chapter. See 58 FR 48780 (September 20, 1993). In the FCA's regulations, the term ``high-risk
assets'' is a generic reference to loans and loan-related assets that are to be categorized for loan performance and
valuation assessment purposes according to the criteria set forth in &sect;621.6 of this chapter. Collectively,
the classifications identified in &sect;621.6 of this chapter are consistent with the terminology used in the commercial
banking industry for nonperforming loans. There is no regulatory requirement to categorize the classification
as ``high-risk assets'' in the report to investors. Rather, proposed &sect;630.20(g)(1)(iii) requires discussion
of any risks that could adversely affect the loan portfolio and loan-related assets. Accordingly, the FCA has retained
the term ``high-risk assets'' and adopted &sect;630.20(g)(1)(iii) essentially as proposed. Proposed &sect;630.20(g)(1)(iii)
is redesignated as &sect;630.20(g)(1)(ii). The FCA further notes that it expects to revisit the issue of accounting
for impaired loans in the future to assess the impact of the implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan, issued by the Financial and Accounting Standards Board.

5. Section 630.20(g)(1)(iii)_Secondary Market Activities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCC commented that secondary market activities have never been and currently are not anticipated to be material
to the System's financial condition. The FCC suggested that proposed &sect;630.20(g)(1)(iv) be modified to require
these activities to be described when they become material to the System's financial condition. The FCA agrees with
the commenter that the System's involvement in the secondary markets should be disclosed to investors when the effect
of such activities on the financial condition of the System is material and has revised proposed &sect;630.20(g)(1)(iv)
to add materiality tests. This provision is redesignated as &sect;630.20(g)(1)(iii) of the final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA believes that the System's statutory authority to participate in secondary markets should be disclosed to
investors in any event. A new paragraph has thus been added in &sect;630.20(a)(1)(vi) of the final rule to require,
without regard to materiality, a description of the authority of System institutions to purchase and sell interests
in loans in secondary markets and the risk involved.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section &sect;630.20(g)(3)(ii) and (iii) require that the System provide a brief description of the System's policies
regarding liquidity and investment. The FCC pointed out that each System bank adopts its own liquidity and investment
policies according to its business objectives. In the absence of universal policies regarding investment and liquidity
among System institutions, the commenter suggested that the proposed regulations be revised to require only a general
description of System banks' policies. The suggested change is consistent with the intent of the proposed regulations.
The FCA has clarified the proposed regulations by revising &sect;630.20(g)(3)(ii)(A) and (g)(3)(iii) to require
a brief overview of liquidity and investment matters.

Section 630.20(g)(3)(iv) requires a general description of the System's risk management practices, including
a brief discussion of derivative transactions. Due to the heightened interest of the public, financial institution
regulators, and Congress in this area, the FCA solicited comments on whether disclosure requirements regarding
derivative activities should be more detailed. The FCC suggested that, given the changing GAAP environment for derivative
transactions, the FCA consider the approach to derivatives activity regulation used by other bank regulators. This
approach requires regulated institutions to adopt policies in accordance with GAAP. The regulator provides any
clarification of GAAP or additional guidance through Call Report instructions or other mechanisms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA adopts &sect;630.20(g)(3)(iv) as proposed, with a clarification to provide for a ``brief overview'' of the
System's asset and liability management practices. The FCA believes that this approach to derivatives activities
disclosure is consistent with the FCC's suggestion. In addition, along with other financial institution regulators,
the FCA is monitoring the area of derivatives activities. The FCA will consider requiring more extensive disclosure
based on its assessment of the level and significance of System derivatives activities and as the need for regulatory
policy in this area becomes more clearly defined.

8. Section 630.20(g)(5)_Insurance Fund
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCC commented that &sect;630.20(g)(5), which requires a discussion of the Insurance Fund in the Discussion and
Analysis (D&amp;A) section of the report to investors, is unnecessary and would duplicate the disclosure contained
in the notes to the System's combined financial statements. Section 630.20(g)(5) requires a discussion of the purposes
of the Insurance Fund, a schedule itemizing Insurance Fund assets that have been identified for specific purposes,
and an explanation of how expenditures of Insurance Fund assets affect the assets and capital of the System.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA does not believe that the requirement of &sect;630.20(g)(5) will result in duplication of information in
the report. Section 630.3(e) provides that ``Information in any part of the report may be incorporated by reference
*&blank;*&blank;* to any other item of the report. Information *&blank;*&blank;* may be presented in any order deemed
suitable by the Funding Corporation.'' Accordingly, the Funding Corporation has the flexibility to determine where
the D&amp;A regarding the Insurance Fund is to be presented. The FCA has adopted &sect;630.20(g)(5) as proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA notes that the regulation does not require the D&amp;A regarding the Insurance Fund to be audited. Pursuant
to &sect;630.3(e), the System could opt to include the required D&amp;A in the notes to the Systemwide combined financial
statements and incorporate the disclosure by reference into the D&amp;A. In this situation, the required D&amp;A
regarding the Insurance Fund would be covered in the independent accountant's report on the Systemwide combined
financial statements.

9. Section 630.20(g)(6)_Instructions for Discussion and Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;630.20(g)(6)(ii) requires that discussions required by proposed &sect;630.20(g) cover the 3-year
period covered by the financial statements. The FCC suggested that the words ``3-year'' be deleted. In recognition
that the reporting period for the balance sheet is only 2 comparative years, the FCA agrees with the commenter and has
amended &sect;630.20(g)(6)(ii) of the final rule as suggested and revised the introductory paragraph of &sect;630.20(g)
accordingly.

10. Section 630.20(i)_Compensation of Directors and Senior Officers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 630.20(i) requires the annual report to state that information on the compensation of directors and senior
officers of System banks is contained in each bank's annual report to shareholders and that the annual report of each
bank is available to investors upon request pursuant to &sect;630.3(f). The FCC commented that this requirement
provides no useful information to investors and is redundant.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated in the rule proposal, the FCA is required by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 514 of the 1992 Act to ensure that the disclosure of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial and conflict-of-interest information by System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personnel provides investors and potential investors with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information necessary to assist them in making investment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decisions regarding FCS debt obligations or institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA believes that information on compensation of System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directors and senior officers presented in individual System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions' disclosure to shareholders pursuant to part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
620 of this chapter could provide useful information to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investors in making investment decisions. Thus, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement the requirement of section 514 of the 1992 Act, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;630.20(i) requires that the report provide a statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
informing investors of the availability of such information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA adopts &sect;630.20(i) of the final rule as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
11. Section 630.20(l) and (m)_Financial Statements and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Supplemental Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;630.30(l) requires that the System prepare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the combined financial statements in accordance with GAAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and instructions and other requirements of the FCA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;630.20(m) further requires that the System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide supplemental information in addition to the audited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial statements and that the supplemental information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be examined by a qualified public accountant for compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with FCA regulations and guidelines and an opinion expressed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thereon. The FCA received comments on proposed &sect;630.20(l) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the AICPA and the FCC and comments on proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;630.20(m) from the AICPA and Price Waterhouse. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to proposed &sect;630.20(l), both the FCC and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the AICPA suggested, for different reasons, that the phrase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``instructions and other requirements of the FCA'' be deleted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the proposed rule. The FCC was concerned that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed language indicates that regulatory accounting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practices (RAP) may be utilized, causing investor confusion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, the AICPA provided suggested language 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that would require both the basic financial statement and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the supplemental information required by proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;630.20(l) and (m) to be audited in accordance with GAAS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AICPA asserted that the requirements of proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;630.20(m) regarding supplemental information disclosure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appear to comprise the ``instructions and other requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the FCA'' referred to in &sect;630.20(l) and, further, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GAAS addresses auditors' reporting on information presented 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outside financial statements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Price Waterhouse, the external auditor of the System, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also commented on proposed &sect;630.20(m). Price Waterhouse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asserted that the proposed language that ``supplemental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information be examined by a qualified public accountant for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with FCA regulations and guidelines'' is too broad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and would be interpreted as requiring the independent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accountant to render a report on the System's compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with all FCA regulations and guidelines. This would require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant work by the independent accountant. Price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Waterhouse commented that the proposed regulatory language 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in &sect;630.20(m) provides insufficient detail to enable the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
external auditor to determine the scope of additional work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be performed and the type of report to be issued by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
auditor on the supplemental information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;630.20(l) was intended to preserve the FCA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ability to prescribe additional requirements for preparation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and presentation of the Systemwide combined financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statements. However, after consideration of the comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received, the FCA adopts the AICPA's suggestion in the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule to require that both the basic financial statements and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the supplemental information required by &sect;630.20(l) and (m) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be examined in accordance with GAAS and an opinion expressed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thereon by an independent accountant. This change will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resolve the FCC concern regarding RAP financial statements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Price Waterhouse's concern regarding the scope of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examination of supplemental information and reporting by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
independent accountant. However, to preserve the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flexibility to revise the format and content specified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix A of the final rule, the FCA retains the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement that supplemental information be prepared in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with any additional FCA guidance or instructions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

12. Section 630.20(o)_Cross-Reference Sheet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;630.20(o) called for a cross-reference sheet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
giving the location of information required by these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, in the order required, and identified by item 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numbers and captions. The FCC did not object to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation of a cross-reference sheet, but suggested that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the cross-reference sheet would only be useful to the FCA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and should only be required as an exhibit to copies of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report filed with the FCA. The FCA believes the cross 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference to the content of the report provides useful 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information to readers of the report. To make this indexing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement more useful to investors, the FCA has revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;630.20(o) to inform readers of the location in the report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the information required under the major disclosure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
captions of this part.

G. Subpart C_Quarterly Report to Investors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;630.40(b)(5) requires that the System file a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``preferability'' letter with the FCA disclosing any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accounting changes made during the reporting period that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not required by new accounting pronouncements. The AICPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the FCC commented that the requirement for filing a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate letter with the FCA explaining the reason for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preferable alternative accounting principle is unnecessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
They suggested that the requirement be deleted from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;630.40(b)(5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The preferability letter was intended as a notice to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inform the FCA of any accounting change made by the System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the interim period that is not required by existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accounting pronouncements. Because the quarterly report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be required to disclose such accounting changes, upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further consideration, the FCA has deleted the requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of filing a preferability letter from &sect;630.40(b)(5) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule.

condition and results of operations of System institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as determined by evaluating the amounts and certainty of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cashflows from operations and from outside sources. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information provided pursuant to this section need only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include that which is available to System institutions and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which does not clearly appear in the combined financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The D&amp;A of the financial statements and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statistical data shall be presented in a manner designed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enhance a reader's understanding of the combined financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition, results of operations, cashflows, and changes in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capital of System institutions. Unless otherwise specified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in &sect;630.20(g), the discussion shall cover the period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
covered by the financial statements and shall use year-to-year comparisons or any other understandable format.
Where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trend information is relevant, reference to the 5-year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selected financial data required by paragraph (f) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section may be necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The D&amp;A shall focus specifically on material 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
events and uncertainties known at the time of reporting that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would cause reported financial information not to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessarily indicative of future operating results or of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
future financial condition. This should include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
descriptions and amounts of: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Matters that would have an impact on future 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations but that have not had an impact in the past; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Matters that have had an impact on reported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations but are not expected to have an impact on future 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations.

(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The quarterly report to investors shall contain the information specified in this section along with any other material
information necessary to make the required disclosures, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. The quarterly report must be presented in a format that is easily understandable and not misleading.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Rules for condensation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of this subpart, major captions to be provided in interim financial statements are the same as those provided
in the financial statements contained in the annual report to investors, except that the financial statements included
in the quarterly report may be condensed into major captions in accordance with the rules prescribed under this paragraph.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Interim balance sheets. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When any major balance sheet caption is less than 10 percent of total assets and the amount in the caption has not increased
or decreased by more than 25 percent since the end of the preceding fiscal year, the caption may be combined with others.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Interim statements of income. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When any major income statement caption is less than 15 percent of average net income for the 3 most recent fiscal years
and the amount in the caption has not increased or decreased by more than 20 percent since the corresponding interim
period of the preceding fiscal year, the caption may be combined with others. In calculating average net income, loss
years should be excluded. If losses were incurred in each of the 3 most recent fiscal years, the average loss shall be
used for purposes of this test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The interim financial information shall include disclosure either on the face of the financial statements or
in accompanying footnotes sufficient to make the interim information presented not misleading. It may be presumed
that users of the interim financial information have read or have access to the audited financial statements for the
preceding fiscal year, and the adequacy of additional disclosure needed for a fair presentation may be determined
in that context. Accordingly, footnote disclosure that would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained
in the most recent audited financial statements (such as a statement of significant accounting policies and practices)
and details of accounts that have not changed significantly in amount or composition since the end of the most recently
completed fiscal year may be omitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Interim reports shall disclose events that have occurred subsequent to the end of the most recently completed
fiscal year that have a material impact on the System. Disclosures should encompass, for example, significant changes
since the end of the most recently completed fiscal year in such items as accounting principles and practices, estimates
used in the preparation of financial statements, status of long-term contracts, capitalization, significant new
indebtedness or modification of existing financing agreements, financial assistance received, significant business
combinations and liquidations of System institutions, and terminations of System institution status. Notwithstanding
the provisions of this paragraph, where material contingencies exist, disclosure of such matters shall be provided
even though a significant change since yearend may not have occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) In addition to meeting the reporting requirements specified by existing accounting pronouncements for accounting
changes, state the date of any material accounting change and the reasons for making it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Any material prior period adjustment made during any period covered by the interim financial statements shall
be disclosed, together with its effect upon net income and upon the balance of surplus for any prior period included.
If results of operations for any period presented have been adjusted retroactively by such an item subsequent to the
initial reporting of such period, similar disclosure of the effect of the change shall be made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Interim financial statements furnished shall reflect all adjustments that are necessary to a fair statement
of the results for the interim periods presented. A statement to that effect shall be included. Furnish any material
information necessary to make the information called for not misleading, such as a statement that the results for
interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) If any amount that would otherwise be required to be shown by this section with respect to any item is not material,
it need not be separately shown. The combination of insignificant items is permitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion and analysis of interim financial condition and results of operations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Discuss any material changes to the information disclosed to investors pursuant to &sect;630.20(g) that have occurred
during the periods specified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section. Provide any additional information
needed to enable the reader to assess material changes in financial condition and results of operations between the
periods specified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This action modifies the Class D airspace area at Baltimore, Martin State Airport, MD by amending this area's effective
hours to coincide with the associated control tower hours of operation. This action also establishes Class E airspace
in this area when the associated control tower is closed. The intended effect of this action is to clarify when two-way
radio communication with the air traffic control tower is required and to provide adequate Class E airspace for instrument
approach procedures when the control tower is closed.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Request for Comments on the Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Although this action is a final rule, and was not preceded by notice and public procedure, comments are invited on the
rule. All comments should be submitted, in triplicate, to Mr. Frank Jordan at the address specified above. An informal
docket may also be examined during normal business hours at the address specified above. This rule will become effective
on the date specified in the ``DATES'' section. However, after the review of any comments, and if the FAA finds that
further changes are appropriate, it will initiate rulemaking proceedings to extend the effective date of the rule
or to amend the regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments that provide the factual basis supporting the views and suggestions presented are particularly helpful
in evaluating the effects of the rule, and in determining whether additional rulemaking is required. Comments are
specifically invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, environmental, and energy-related aspects
of the rule which might suggest the need to modify the rule.

The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) modifies the Class D airspace area at
Baltimore, Martin State Airport, MD, by amending this area's effective hours to coincide with the associated control
tower's hours of operation. This action also establishes Class E airspace in this area when the associated control
tower is closed. Prior to Airspace Reclassification, an airport traffic area (ATA) and a control zone (CZ) existed
at this airport. However, Airspace Reclassification, effective September 16, 1993, discontinued the use of the
term ``airport traffic area'' and ``control zone,'' replacing them with the designation ``Class D airspace.'' The
former CZ was continuous, while the former ATA was contingent upon the operation of the air traffic control tower.
The consolidation of the ATA and CZ into a single Class D airspace designation makes it necessary to modify the effective
hours of the Class D airspace to coincide with the control tower's hours of operation. This action also establishes
Class E airspace during the hours the control tower is closed. The intended effect of this action is to clarify when
two-way radio communication with the air traffic control tower is required and to provide adequate Class E airspace
for instrument approach procedures when this control tower is closed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D and E airspace designations
are published in Paragraphs 5000 and 6002, respectively, of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September
16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class D and E airspace designations listed in this document
will be published subsequently in the Order. Under the circumstances presented, the FAA concludes that there is an
immediate need to modify this Class D and establish this Class E airspace area in order to promote the safe and efficient
handling of air traffic in these areas. Therefore, I find that notice and public procedures under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are
impracticable and contrary to public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. it therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Request for Comments on the Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Although this action is a final rule, and was not preceded by notice and public procedure, comments are invited on the
rule. All comments should be submitted, in triplicate, to Mr. Frank Jordan at the address specified above. An informal
docket may also be examined during normal business hours at the address specified above. This rule will become effective
on the date specified in the ``DATES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' section. However, after the review of any comments, and if the FAA finds that further changes are appropriate, it
will initiate rulemaking proceedings to extend the effective date of the rule or to amend the regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments that provide the factual basis supporting the views and suggestions presented are particularly helpful
in evaluating the effects of the rule, and in determining whether additional rulemaking is required. Comments are
specifically invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, environmental, and energy-related aspects
of the rule which might suggest the need to modify the rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) modifies the Class D airspace area at
Wilmington, DE, by amending this area's effective hours to coincide with the associated control tower's hours of
operation. This action also establishes Class E airspace at these areas when the associated control tower is closed.
Prior to Airspace Reclassification, an airport traffic area (ATA) and a control zone (CZ) existed at this airport.
However, Airspace Reclassification, effective September 16, 1993, discontinued the use of the term ``airport traffic
area'' and ``control zone,'' replacing them with the designation ``Class D airspace.'' The former CZ was continuous,
while the former ATA was contingent upon the operation of the air traffic control tower. The consolidation of the ATA
and CZ into a single Class D airspace designation makes it necessary to modify the effective hours of the Class D airspace
to coincide with the control tower's hours of operation. This action also establishes Class E airspace during the
hours the control tower is closed. The intended effect of this action is to clarify when two-way radio communication
with the air traffic control tower is required and to provide adequate Class E airspace for instrument approach procedures
when these control towers are closed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D and E airspace designations
are published in Paragraphs 5000 and 6002, respectively, of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September
16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class D and E airspace designations listed in this document
will be published subsequently in the Order. Under the circumstances presented, the FAA concludes that there is an
immediate need to modify this Class D and establish this Class E airspace area in order to promote the safe and efficient
handling of air traffic in these areas. Therefore, I find that notice and public procedures under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are
impracticable and contrary to the public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document amends the Customs Regulations by adopting final rules to implement, in part, those provisions of the
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 that provide for overtime and premium pay for Customs Officers performing
inspectional services. This document addresses the public comments submitted in response to the interim regulations
which initially implemented the pay reform provisions, and makes certain changes to those interim regulations in
response to the public comments and in order to add clarity and improve the readability of the final regulations.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 10, 1993, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;66, 107 Stat. 312) (the 1993 Act)
was signed into law. Part II of Subchapter D of Title XIII of the 1993 Act (107 Stat. 668)_popularly referred to as the
Customs Officer Pay Reform Amendments (COPRA)_amended section 5 of the Act of February 13, 1911 (19 U.S.C. 261 and
267) to reform the overtime_and establish a premium_pay system by which Customs Officers who perform inspectional
services would be compensated. In general, while the COPRA retained the basic double-time compensation rate for
overtime services, its three sections (sections 13811&hyph;13813) made certain changes concerning how and when
such Customs Officers would be compensated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 13811 (codified, in part, at 19 U.S.C. 267) amended 19 U.S.C. 261, 267, and 1450 (and repealed 19 U.S.C. 1451a)
to create a new and exclusive overtime compensation and premium pay schedule for Customs Officers performing inspectional
services, and required the Secretary of the Treasury to promulgate regulations to prevent certain abuses that developed
under the old pay system. Section 13812 amended 5 U.S.C. 8331(3) to provide additional benefits for Customs Officers;
it allows overtime compensation to be included in the calculation of Federal retirement annuities, up to an amount
equal to 50 percent of the applicable statutory pay limitation, and authorizes the payment of cash awards to Customs
Officers for foreign language proficiency. Section 13813 amended 19 U.S.C. 13031(f)(3) to make certain adjustments
concerning reimbursements from the Customs User Fee Account. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 28, 1993, Customs published as T.D. 94&hyph;2 interim regulations in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 68520) to implement the provisions of section 13811 of the 1993 Act. (The provisions of sections 13812 and 13813
of the 1993 Act were not dealt with in that document; the regulations implementing those aspects of the pay reform provisions
will be issued by the Office of Personnel Management and Customs at a later date.) The interim regulations amended
and revised certain sections in parts 4, 24, 122, 123, and 134 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR parts 4, 24, 122, 123,
and 134) and solicited comments concerning these changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three parties submitted comments regarding one or more aspects of the interim regulations. The comments received,
and Customs responses to them, are set forth below.

Discussion of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The comments received raised, in part, six areas of concern that will be responded to in this document: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Customs interpretation of the exclusivity clause (19 U.S.C. 267(c)(2)) regarding when and how shift differential
allowances would be paid (19 CFR 24.16(a)); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) whether the definition of ``regularly-scheduled administrative workweek'' precluded considerations of other,
alternative work schedules (19 CFR 24.16(b)(16)); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) the propriety of defining ``work assignment priorities'' in agency regulations (19 CFR 24.16(d)); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) the inclusion of workers compensation benefits in the listing of categories for which Customs Officers may receive
pay for work not performed (19 CFR 24.16(e)(2)(ii));

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(5) the payment of commute compensation when the overtime assignment begins 16 hours or more after the last regularly
scheduled assignment (19 CFR 24.16(f)(2)(v)), and; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) the exclusion of workers compensation benefits from any applicable pay cap calculations (19 CFR 24.16(h)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certain other issues raised by the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU, one of the parties submitting comments)
are the subject of pending litigation before the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (Civil
Action No. 94&hyph;0163, filed January 31, 1994). As it would be inappropriate for Customs to discuss those issues
at this time, those comments are not addressed in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
document. We now address the identified areas of concern in turn.

24.16(a)_Interpretation of exclusivity clause

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the 1993 Act prohibits employees who are paid overtime under subsection (a) of the statute or premium pay
under subsection (b) of the statute from receiving ``*&blank;*&blank;* pay or other compensation for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
that work 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
under any other provision of law'' (emphasis in original), the exclusivity clause contained in the 1993 Act does not
divest employees of their right to receive payment under other applicable pay statutes for work performed during
periods for which no 1993 Act payments are received. For example, an employee may be assigned to a night shift for which
no night work differential is payable under the 1993 Act (11:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.). That employee should still be paid
night shift differential from 6:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. under the Federal Employees Pay Act (FEPA) or other applicable
law. The interim regulations should be modified to reflect this entitlement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Customs Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Customs disagrees. With enactment of the COPRA in the 1993 Act, Congress created a total pay and compensation system
unique to the inspectional duties performed by Customs Officers. The establishment of this new system effectively
removed those officers from coverage under any other statute for pay and compensation purposes. Accordingly, no
change to &sect;24.16(a) is made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the COPRA were promulgated, Congress reasoned that its purpose in requiring Customs Officers to work 40 hours
in a week or 8 hours in a day, without regard to the hour of the day or the day of the week, before they qualify for overtime
pay, was to encourage Customs to adjust its inspectional resources to meet actual trade patterns, rather than forcing
the trade community to adjust to a predetermined Customs workday. Also, Congress wanted Customs to measure workload
and trade patterns at each of its ports and then adjust work schedules to meet that demand while using as little overtime
as possible. See, ``Report of the Committee on the Budget House of Representatives on Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1993'', Report 103&hyph;111 (May 25, 1993), p. 573. Since section 267(c)(2) clearly provides that a Customs
Officer who receives overtime pay under subsection (a) (19 U.S.C. 267(a)) or premium pay under subsection (b) (19
U.S.C. 267(b)) for time worked may not receive pay or other compensation for that work under any other provision of
law, it is axiomatic that Congress' explanation in the context of overtime pay is equally applicable to the payment
of premium pay differentials, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., night shift pay. And, as no allowance for night work differential premium pay is authorized under the Customs Officer
Pay Reform provisions where less than a majority of night work hours is worked during the specified time periods (19
U.S.C. 267(b)(1)&hyph;(3), 19 CFR 24.16(g)(3)(i)&hyph;(iii)), it is clear that the 1993 Act does divest Customs
Officers_but not other Customs employees_of their right to receive payment under other applicable pay statutes
for work performed. Any other interpretation of section 267(c)(2) would render the express limitation meaningless.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the scenario presented in the commenter's example, the payment of night differential premium pay is not authorized
because the Customs Officer, as defined at 19 U.S.C. 267(e)(1) and subject to the overtime and premium pay provisions
of 19 U.S.C. 267, does not work a majority of hours between any of the three time frames established by Congress for payment
of such premium pay. See, 19 U.S.C. 267(b)(1)(A) through (C). Although the Customs Officer is officially assigned
to work an 8-hour shift which goes past the, heretofore, traditional working day of 6:00 p.m., no night work differential
is authorized under the exclusivity of pay provision under the COPRA (19 U.S.C. 267(c)(2)); the terms of the exclusivity
provision expressly preclude dual pay/compensation entitlement considerations under other Federal pay statutes.

24.16(b)(16)_Definition of ``Regularly-scheduled administrative workweek''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Regarding the definition of ``regularly-scheduled administrative workweek'', the following sentence should
be added, ``This section is not meant to prohibit consideration of alternative work schedules at a local level'' to
reflect the provisions of 5 CFR 610.121 and Article 21, Section 3A of the National Agreement between Customs and the
National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Customs Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The pay reform provisions of the 1993 Act do not affect or otherwise address the question of alternate work schedules
(AWS), which has a separate statutory basis. See, 5 U.S.C. 6120 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We believe that the addition of the requested sentence is unnecessary. Accordingly, no change to &sect;24.16(b)(16)
is made.

24.16(d)_``Work assignment priorities''/(annuity integrity) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NTEU objects to the inclusion of work assignment priorities provisions in the regulations (&sect;24.16(d)),
as these issues are negotiable under the terms of the Civil Service Reform Act. Especially objectionable is the inclusion
of the overtime earnings ``band'' in &sect;24.16(d)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Customs agrees that the inclusion of the equalization provision in the work assignment priorities may be overbroad
as written and could be subject to negotiations under the terms of the Civil Service Reform Act; however, Customs believes
that the other two principles (alignment and least cost) are properly contained in the regulations, as they are in
accordance with the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 267(d)(1), which require the Secretary of the Treasury to promulgate
such regulations as will prevent the abuse of callback work assignments and commuting time compensation. Accordingly,
&sect;24.16(d) is revised by deleting the equalization principle and replacing it with a more restricted ``annuity
integrity'' principle that is more in accordance with the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 267(d)(2), which requires the Secretary
to promulgate such regulations as will prevent the disproportionately more frequent assignment of overtime work
to Customs Officers who are near to their retirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Annuity integrity is based on the average yearly amount of overtime Customs Officers worked during their career with
Customs. Under annuity integrity the amount of overtime that can be worked by a Customs Officer who is within 3 years
of his/her statutory retirement eligibility, see, 5 U.S.C. chapters 83 or 84, is limited to the average yearly number
of overtime hours the Customs Officer worked during his/her career with the Customs Service. If the dollar value of
the average yearly number of overtime hours worked by such Customs Officer exceeds 50 percent of the applicable statutory
pay cap, then no overtime earning limitation based on this annuity integrity provision would apply. Waivers concerning
this annuity integrity limitation may be granted by the Commissioner of Customs or the Commissioner's designee in
individual cases in order to prevent excessive costs or to meet emergency requirements of Customs. Customs believes
that this principle of annuity integrity is in accordance with the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 267(d)(2) and, as such,
properly belongs in the regulations.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NTEU requests the inclusion of workers compensation benefits to the listing of categories for which Customs Officers
may receive payment for work that is not performed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Customs Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Unlike the form of workers compensation enumerated in this section (continuation of pay under the workers compensation
law, which is paid by the employing agency), workers compensation benefits_in the form of compensation for lost wages_are
paid by the Department of Labor. See, 5 U.S.C. 8101 and 20 CFR part 10. As this latter form of workers compensation is
not within the direct control of the Secretary of the Treasury, its inclusion at &sect;24.16(e)(2)(ii) would be inappropriate.
Accordingly, no change to &sect;24.16(e)(2)(ii) is made.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The commute compensation provisions include a section that a Customs Officer will not be paid for commute time if the
overtime assignment begins 16 hours or more after the last regularly scheduled assignment. This section makes it
extremely difficult for those inspectors that work Monday through Friday to serve the public on Saturdays and Sundays.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Customs Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This eligibility condition for commute compensation is statutory. See, 19 U.S.C. 267(a)(2)(B)(ii)(I). Thus, Customs
cannot deviate from the statutory requirements, but does note that the additional compensation_a flat 3 hours at
the basic pay rate_is in addition to callback pay. Accordingly, no change to &sect;24.16(f)(2)(v) is made.

 The NTEU requests the exclusion of workers compensation benefits and back pay awards and settlements from the listing

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Customs Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Regarding the exclusion of workers compensation benefits from the list of payment categories subject to pay cap limitations,
for the reasons given above at &sect;24.16(e)(2)(ii), no change to &sect;24.16(h) is made. Regarding the exclusion
of back pay awards and settlements, the current regulatory language provides that ``awards made in accordance with
back pay settlements'' shall not be applied to any applicable pay cap calculations. This correctly conveys the fact
that such awards are exempt. Accordingly, no change to &sect;24.16(h) is made concerning this point.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the changes discussed above in connection with the analysis of comments, the regulatory texts as set
forth below incorporate certain editorial or other non-substantive changes to the interim regulations to add clarity
and improve the readability of the final regulations. The sections of the interim regulations affected by these changes
are indicated below.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As the definitions of ``commute compensation'' (19 CFR 24.16(b)(5)), ``overtime pay'' (19 CFR 24.16(b)(13)), and
``premium pay differential'' (19 CFR 24.16(b)(15))_now denominated &sect;24.16(b)(14), see next paragraph below
for explanation on redenomination_encompass similar elements pertaining to compensation, the wording of these
three sections is recast to employ a parallel construction for ease of readability and to add clarity to their exclusive
meanings.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of the change to &sect;24.16(d) discussed above under the Discussion of Comments, a definition for ``participating
group'' (19 CFR 24.16(b)(14)) is no longer needed. Accordingly, in &sect;24.16(b), paragraphs (15) and (16) are
redenominated paragraphs (14) and (15), respectively.

24.16(c)_Application and bond 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the interim regulations did not make any changes to the provisions of &sect;24.16(c), because this section
references Customs ``employees'' rather than Customs ``Officers'', the term ``employee'' in paragraphs (1) through
(3) is replaced with the term ``Officer'' to reflect the new restricted application of &sect;24.16, as amended by
the COPRA provisions of the 1993 Act. This change is made to make the provisions of paragraph (c) more harmonious with
the rest of the provisions in &sect;24.16.

24.16(e)_Overtime pay

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In paragraph (2)(i) of &sect;24.16(e), the second sentence regarding the rounding off of overtime work performed
in increments other than a full quarter hour is deleted because it seeks to address a problem that is subject to negotiations
under the terms of the Civil Service Reform Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In paragraph (2)(ii) of &sect;24.16(e), the last sentence is revised by deleting the words ``for the work assignment''
after ``reports'' and adding the words ``as assigned'' to make it clear that overtime pay is now restricted to hours
assigned and worked.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In paragraph (3) of &sect;24.16(f), the last sentence regarding the treatment of certain overtime work to prevent
the inappropriate payment of commute compensation is deleted because it represents a regulatory attempt to correct
a scheduling issue. The district director is responsible for and has discretion in scheduling appropriate overtime
assignments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In paragraph (4) of &sect;24.16(f), a stylistic change is made in the first sentence (changing the reference from
``he'' to ``the officer'') and a modification is made in the second sentence (allowing less than all overtime assignments
to be treated as one continuous callback assignment) to give management more flexibility in the assignment of overtime
work.

24.16(g)_Premium pay differentials 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the reasons given above concerning recasting three provisions in &sect;24.16(b) because the terms defined encompassed
similar elements pertaining to compensation, the three provisions in &sect;24.16(g) pertaining to premium pay

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_paragraphs(g)(1) (Holiday differential), (g)(2) (Sunday differential), and (g)(3) (Night work differential)_are
recast to employ a parallel construction for ease of readability and to add clarity to their exclusive meanings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In paragraph (1)(iv) of &sect;24.16(g), the first sentence is revised and a second sentence is added to make it clear
that where only one assigned shift is worked and any of those hours occur during the 24-hour calendar day of a holiday,
the entire shift will be designated as a holiday and compensated at the holiday rate of pay. Also, a new paragraph (vi)
is added to clarify the compensation computation where only a portion of a regularly-scheduled, non-overtime, holiday
shift is worked.

134.55_Compensation of Customs Officers and employees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of &sect;134.55, a grammatical change is made to clarify which regulatory provisions
(COPRA or FEPA) are applicable to provide compensation for which Customs personnel. The change provides that the
COPRA compensation provisions of &sect;24.16 are applicable regarding overtime compensation and premium pay for
Customs Officers, and that the FEPA compensation provisions of &sect;24.17 are applicable regarding overtime compensation
for other Customs employees.

Conclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In consideration of the comments received, Customs believes that the interim Pay Reform for Customs Inspectional
Services regulations, published as T.D. 94&hyph;2 in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 28, 1993 (58 FR 68520), should be adopted as a final rule with certain changes thereto, as discussed above
and set forth below.

Based on the supplementary information set forth above and because the amendments contained in this document reflect

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., it is certified that the regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. Accordingly, the regulations are not subject to the regulatory analysis or other requirements of 5 U.S.C.
603 and 604. This document does not meet the criteria for a ``significant regulatory action'' as specified in E.O.

 For Customs Officers within 3 years of their statutory retirement eligibility, the amount of overtime that can be
worked is limited to the average yearly number of overtime hours the Customs Officer worked during his/her career
with the Customs Service. If the dollar value of the average yearly number of overtime hours worked by such Customs
Officer exceeds 50 percent of the applicable statutory pay cap, then no overtime earning limitation based on this
annuity integrity provision would apply. Waivers concerning this annuity integrity limitation may be granted by
the Commissioner of Customs or the Commissioner's designee in individual cases in order to prevent excessive costs
or to meet emergency requirements of Customs.

of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, then the officer shall be entitled to commute compensation each time the officer
returns to the place of work provided that each assignment commences less than 16 hours after the officer's last regularly-scheduled
work assignment. However, in no case shall the compensation be greater than if some or all of the assignments were treated
as one continuous callback assignment.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule is issued by the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to place alpha-ethyltryptamine
(AET) into Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). This action is based on findings made by the Deputy Administrator
of the DEA, after review and evaluation of the relevant data by both the DEA and the Assistant Secretary for Health,
Department of Health and Human Services, that AET meets the statutory criteria for inclusion in Schedule I of the CSA.
Since this substance has been temporarily placed into Schedule I, the regulatory control mechanisms and criminal
sanctions of Schedule I continue to be applicable to the manufacture, distribution, importation and exportation
of AET.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 12, 1993, the Administrator of the DEA published a final rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 13533) amending &sect;1308.11(g) of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations to temporarily place AET into
Schedule I of the CSA pursuant to the temporary scheduling provisions of 21 U.S.C. 811(h). This final rule, which became
effective on the date of publication, was based on a finding by the Administrator that the temporary scheduling of
AET was necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety. The CSA (21 U.S.C. 811(h)(2)) requires that the
temporary scheduling of a substance expires at the end of one year from the effective date of the order. However, if
proceedings to schedule a substance pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 811(a)(1) have been initiated and are pending, the temporary
scheduling of a substance may be extended for up to six months. Under this provision, the temporary scheduling of AET
which would have expired on March 12, 1994, was extended to September 12, 1994 by the Acting DEA Administrator (59 FR
10720).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 7, 1994 in a notice of proposed rulemaking published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 10718) and after a review of relevant data, the Acting DEA Administrator proposed to place AET into Schedule
I of the CSA pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 811(a). Prior to that time the Acting DEA Administrator submitted data which DEA gathered
regarding AET to the Assistant Secretary for Health, delegate of the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human
Services. In accordance with 21 U.S.C. 811(b), the Acting DEA Administrator also requested a scientific and medical
evaluation and a scheduling recommendation for AET from the Assistant Secretary for Health.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated August 30, 1994, the Deputy Administrator for the DEA received the scientific and medical evaluation
and scheduling recommendation from the Assistant Secretary for Health. The Assistant Secretary recommended that
AET be placed into Schedule I of the CSA based on a scientific and medical evaluation of the available data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The notice of proposed rulemaking for AET provided the opportunity for interested parties to submit comments, objections
or requests for a hearing regarding the scheduling of AET. No comments, objections or requests for hearings were received
regarding the scheduling of AET.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alpha-ethyltryptamine has been classified as a tryptamine hallucinogen. Chemically it is 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
a
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-ethyl-1H-indole-3-ethanamine or 3-(2-aminobutyl)indole. It is structurally similar to N,N-dimethyltryptamine
(DMT) and N,N-diethyltryptamine (DET) both of which are controlled in Schedule I of the CSA. Available data indicate
that AET produces some pharmacological effects qualitatively similar to those of other Schedule I hallucinogens.
Recent data suggests that AET may produce neurotoxicity similar to the neurotoxic effects produced by MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine)
and PCA (para-chloroamphetamine).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alpha-ethyltryptamine acetate was marketed by the Upjohn Company in 1961 as an antidepressant under the trade name
of Monase. After less than one year of marketing, Upjohn withdrew its New Drug Application when it became apparent
that Monase administration was associated with the development of agranulocytosis. The Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) has notified the DEA that there are no exemptions or approvals in effect under section 505 of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act for AET. A search of the scientific and medical literature revealed no indications of current
medical use of AET in the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The DEA first encountered AET in 1986 at a clandestine laboratory in Nevada. Several exhibits of AET have been analyzed
by the DEA and state forensic laboratories since 1989. Individuals in Colorado and Arizona have purchased several
kilograms of this substance as the acetate salt from chemical supply companies and have distributed and sold quantities
to individuals for the purpose of human consumption. Touted as a MDMA-like substance, it has been trafficked as ``TRIP''
or ``ET''. Distribution has been primarily among high school and college-aged individuals. In Arizona, the death
of a nineteen year old female was attributed to acute AET toxicity. Illicit use of AET has been documented in both Germany
and Spain where at least two deaths have resulted from AET overdose.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the investigation and review conducted by DEA and upon the scientific and medical evaluation and recommendation
of the Assistant Secretary for Health received in accordance with 21 U.S.C. 811(b), the Deputy Administrator for
the DEA, pursuant to the provisions of 21 U.S.C. 811 (a) and (b), finds that:

(1) AET has a high potential for abuse;

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Sections 812 (g) and (h) of the Fair Housing Act authorize the Secretary to make determinations of reasonable cause
to believe that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred. Section 810(c) authorizes the Secretary to refer
to the Attorney General matters involving possible breaches of conciliation agreements by respondents for enforcement.
Regulations found at 24 CFR parts 103 and 104 govern the conduct of investigations under the Act by the Assistant Secretary
and the taking of enforcement action in a number of situations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 5, 1994 (59 FR 39955), HUD published a final rule that amended its Fair Housing Complaint Processing regulations,
which are codified in 24 CFR part 103. The purpose of the August 5, 1994 final rule was to advise the public that the Assistant
Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (and the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Investigations and Enforcement),
rather than the General Counsel, is authorized (1) to make and issue determinations that reasonable cause exists
to believe that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred and direct the issuance of charges based on such determinations,
and (2) to refer matters involving possible breaches of conciliation agreements to the Attorney General.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This authority was previously delegated to HUD's General Counsel and Deputy General Counsel by the Secretary. Through
the August 5, 1994 final rule, the Secretary transferred the delegation of this authority from the General Counsel
and the Deputy General Counsel to the Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity and the Deputy Assistant
Secretary for Investigations and Enforcement. In transferring this delegation, however, the Secretary intended
for the General Counsel to be consulted and to concur in a determination of reasonable cause before the Assistant Secretary
for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity directs the issuance of such a charge. The language requiring concurrence
of the General Counsel in reasonable cause determinations was inadvertently omitted from the August 5, 1994 final
rule, and therefore does not correctly reflect the Secretary's intended delegation of authority on this matter.
The purpose of this document is to correct this error.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, FR Doc. 94&hyph;19178, a final rule published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 5, 1994 (59 FR 39955) is corrected to read as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. In the preamble, on page 39955, in the second column, under the heading ``Supplementary Information,'' the second
and third paragraphs under this heading are corrected to read as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule amends portions of 24 CFR part 103 to advise that the Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity
(and the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Investigations and Enforcement) is authorized, with the concurrence of
the General Counsel, to make and issue determinations that reasonable cause exists to believe that a discriminatory
housing practice has occurred and to direct the issuance of charges based on such determinations. The Assistant Secretary
also is authorized to refer matters involving possible breaches of conciliation agreements to the Attorney General.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This authority was previously delegated to the General Counsel and Deputy General Counsel of the Department by the
Secretary. Through this final rule, the Secretary has now transferred the delegation of this authority from the General
Counsel and the Deputy General Counsel to the Assistant Secretary. However, before determining that reasonable
cause exists to believe that discriminatory housing practice has occurred, and directing the issuance of a charge
based on that determination, the Assistant Secretary must receive the concurrence of the General Counsel.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to the authority cited below, the Department of the Navy amends 32 CFR Part 701, subpart E, derived from the
Secretary of the Navy Instruction 5720.45, which implements within the Department of the Navy the provisions of Department
of Defense Directives 5400.7 and 5400.7&hyph;R series, Department of Defense Freedom of Information Act Program
(32 CFR Part 286), and Department of Defense Directive 5400.9, Publications of Proposed and Adopted Regulations
Affecting the Public (32 CFR Part 336). This rule is being published by the Department of the Navy for guidance and interest
of the public in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(1). It has been determined that invitation of public comment on these
changes to the Department of the Navy's implementing instruction prior to adoption would be impracticable and unnecessary,
and it is therefore not required under the public rulemaking provisions of 32 CFR Parts 336 and 701, subpart E. Interested
persons, however, are invited to comment in writing on this amendment. All written comments received will be considered
in making subsequent amendments or revisions to 32 CFR Part 701, subpart E, or the instruction upon which it is based.
Changes may be initiated on the basis of comments received. Written comments should be addressed to Lieutenant Sulik,
Office of the Judge Advocate General (Administrative Law Division), 200 Stovall Street, Alexandria, VA 22332&hyph;2400.
It has been determined that this final rule is not a ``major rule'' within the criteria specified in section 1(b) of
Executive Order 12291 and does not have substantial impact on the public.

This subpart prescribes actions to be executed by, or at the direction of, Navy Department [as defined in &sect;700.104(c)
of this chapter] components and specified headquarters activities for apprising members of the public of Department
of the Navy regulations, policies, substantive and procedural rules, and decisions which may affect them, and for
enabling members of the public to participate in Department of the Navy rulemaking processes in matters of substantial
and direct concern to the public. This subpart complements subpart A, which implements Navy-wide requirements for
furnishing documents to members of the public upon request. That a document may be published or indexed and made available
for public inspection and copying under this instruction does not affect the possible requirement under subpart
A for producing it for examination, or furnishing a copy, in response to a request made under that subpart.

Discussion. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 552(a) of title 5, United States Code, requires the Department of the Navy to make available for public inspection
and copying documents which have precedential significance on those Department of the Navy decisions which affect
the public. These documents must be kept readily available for public inspection and copying at designated locations,
unless they are promptly published and copies are offered for sale. Additionally, documents issued after July 4,
1967, are required to be indexed on a current basis. These indexes, or supplements thereto, must be published at least
quarterly in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph. In determining whether a particular document is subject
to the requirements of this paragraph, consideration should be given to the statutory purposes and legal effect of
the provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Statutory purposes. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, the purpose of the requirement to provide members of the public with essential information is to enable
them to deal effectively and knowledgeably with Federal agencies; to apprise members of the public of the existence
and contents of documents which have potential legal consequences as precedents in administrative determinations
which may affect them; and to permit public examination of the basis for administrative actions which affect the public.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Legal effect. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a document is required to be indexed and made available under this paragraph, it may not be used or asserted as a precedent
against a member of the public unless it was so indexed and made available, or unless the person against whom it is asserted
had actual and timely notice of its contents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Classes of documents affected. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Subject to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552(b) which exempt specified matters from the requirements of public disclosure,
the following classes of Department of the Navy documents are included in the requirements of this paragraph: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Final adjudicative opinions and orders
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_opinions (including concurring and dissenting opinions) and orders which are issued as part of the final disposition
of adjudication proceedings (as defined in 5 U.S.C. 551) and which may have precedential effect in the disposition
of other cases affecting members of the public; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Policy statements and interpretations
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_statements of policy and interpretations of less than general applicability (i. e., applicable only to specific
cases; organizations, or persons), which are not required to be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, but which may have precedential effect in the disposition of other cases affecting members of the public; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Manuals and instructions
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_administrative staff manuals, directives, and instructions to staff, or portions thereof, which establish Department
of the Navy policy or interpretations of policy that serve as a basis for determining the rights of members of the public
with regard to Department of the Navy functions. In general, manuals and instructions relating only to internal management
aspects of property or fiscal accounting, personnel administration, and most other ``proprietary'' functions
of the department are not within the scope of this provision. This provision also does not apply to instructions for
employees on methods, techniques, and tactics to be used in performing their duties; for example: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Instructions or manuals issued for audit, investigation, and inspection purposes; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Those which prescribe operational tactics; standards of performance; criteria for defense, prosecution, or
settlement of cases; or negotiating or bargaining techniques, limitations, or positions; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Operations and maintenance manuals and technical information concerning munitions, equipment, and systems,
and foreign intelligence operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In determining whether a document has precedential effect, the primary test is whether it is intended as guidance
to be followed either in decisions or evaluations by the issuing authority's subordinates, or by the issuing authority
itself in the adjudication or determination of future cases involving similar facts or issues. The kinds of orders
or opinions which clearly would have precedential effect are those that are intended to operate both as final dispositions
of the questions involved in the individual cases presented, and as rules of decision to be followed by the issuing
authority or its subordinates in future cases involving similar questions. By contrast, many adjudicative orders
and opinions issued within the Department of the Navy operate only as case-by-case applications of policies or interpretations
established in provisions of manuals or directives and are not themselves used, cited, or relied on as rules of decision
in future cases. In these instances, the underlying manual or directive provisions obviously would have precedential
effect, but the orders and opinions themselves would not have. A recommendation by an official who is not authorized
to adjudicate, or to issue a binding statement of policy or interpretation in a particular matter would not have precedential
effect, though an order, opinion, statement of policy, or interpretation issued by an authorized official pursuant
to such recommendation might have that effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Deletion of identifying details. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Although the exemptions from public disclosure described in 5 U.S.C. 552 and subpart B of this part are applicable
to documents which are required to be indexed and made available for public inspection and copying under this paragraph,
there is no general requirement that any segregable portions of partially exempt documents be so indexed and made
available for public inspection and copying. As a general rule, a record may therefore be held exempt in its entirety
from the requirements of this paragraph if it is determined that it contains exempt matter and that it is reasonably
foreseeable that disclosure would be harmful to an interest protected by that exemption. An exception to this general
rule does exist with regard to a record which would be exempt only because it contains information which, if disclosed,
would result in a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Where necessary to prevent a clearly unwarranted invasion of a person's privacy, identifying details should
be deleted from a record which is required to be indexed and made available for public inspection and copying under
this paragraph. In every such case, the justification for the deletion must be fully stated in writing in a manner which
avoids creating inferences that could be injurious to the person whose privacy is involved. Usual reasons for deletion
of identifying details include protection of privacy in a person's business affairs, medical matters, or private
family matters; humanitarian considerations; and avoidance of embarrassment to a person.

 Each component having cognizance of records required under this paragraph to be indexed shall compile and maintain
an index of such records on a continually current basis. Each such index was required to initially be published by July
1, 1975. An updated version of each such index, or a current supplement thereto, shall be published by an authorized
method at least annually thereafter.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Commercial publication, provided that such commercial publication is readily available to members of the public,
or will be made available upon request and payment of costs (if this method is utilized, information on the cost of copies
and the address from which they may be obtained shall be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
); or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Furnishing internally reproduced copies upon request, at cost not to exceed the direct cost of duplication
in accordance with subpart D of this part, provided that it is determined, by an order published in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, that the publication of the index by methods &sect;701.65(d)(3) (i) or (ii) would be unnecessary or impracticable.
Such order shall state the cost of copies and the address from which they may be obtained. The Chief of Naval Operations
(N09B30) is authorized to issue such an order in a proper case.

 The United States Navy-Marine Corps Court of Military Review is deemed to be a ``court of the United States'' within
the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 551 and is therefore excluded from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552. Nevertheless, unpublished
decisions of the United States Navy-Marine Corps Court of Military Review, although not indexed, are available for

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The requirements of this section are not imposed by statute, but are the implementation of policies and procedures
created administratively in 32 CFR part 336. In effect, the pertinent provisions of 32 CFR part 336 establish, within
the Department of Defense and its components, procedures that are analogous to the public rulemaking procedures
applicable to some functions of other Federal agencies under 5 U.S.C. 553. While the administrative policy of encouraging
the maximum practicable public participation in the Department of the Navy rulemaking shall be diligently followed,
determinations by the Department of the Navy as to whether a proposed regulatory requirement originated by it comes
within the purview of this paragraph and the corresponding provisions of 32 CFR part 336, and as to whether inviting
public comment is warranted, shall be conclusive and final. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Classes of documents affected.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Each proposed regulation or other document of a class described in &sect;701.64(a) (or a proposed revision of an adopted
document of any of those classes) which would ``originate'' within the Department of the Navy a requirement of general
applicability and future effect for implementing, interpreting, or prescribing law or policy, or practice and procedure
requirements constituting authority for prospective actions having substantial and direct impact on the public,
or a significant portion of the public, must be evaluated to determine whether inviting public comment prior to issuance
is warranted. Documents that merely implement regulations previously issued by higher naval authorities or by the
Department of Defense will not be deemed to ``originate'' requirements within the purview of this section. If a proposed
document is within the purview of this section, publication to invite public comment will be warranted unless, upon
evaluation, it is affirmatively determined both that a significant and legitimate interest of the Department of
the Navy or the public will be served by omitting such publication for public comment, and that the document is subject
to one or more of the following exceptions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) It pertains to a military or foreign affairs function of the United States which has been determined under the criteria
of an Executive Order or statute to require a security classification in the interests of national defense or foreign
policy; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) It relates to naval management, naval military or civilian personnel, or public contracts (e.g., Navy Procurement
Directives), including nonappropriated fund contracts; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) It involves interpretative rules, general statements of policy, or rules of agency organization, procedure,
or practice; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) It is determined with regard to the document, for good cause, that inviting public comment is impracticable, unnecessary,
or contrary to the public interest.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Unless the official having cognizance of a proposed regulatory document determines under the criteria of &sect;701.66(b)
that inviting public comment is not warranted, he or she shall cause it to be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 with an invitation for the public to submit comments in the form of written data, views, or arguments during a specified
period of not less than 30 days following the date of publication. An opportunity for oral presentation normally will
not be provided, but may be provided at the sole discretion of the official having cognizance of the proposed directive
if he or she deems it to be in the best interest of the Department of the Navy or the public to do so. After careful consideration
of all relevant matters presented within the period specified for public comment, the proposed document may be issued
in final form. After issuance, the adopted document, and a preamble explaining the relationship of the adopted document
to the proposed document and the nature and effect of public comments, shall be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

 The official having cognizance of a proposed document within the purview of this paragraph shall, if he or she determines
that inviting public comment concerning the document is not warranted under the criteria of &sect;701.66(b), incorporate
that determination, and the basis therefor, in the document when it is issued or submitted to a higher authority for
issuance. After issuance, such document shall be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

In accordance with the provisions of 32 CFR part 336, the Department of the Navy shall accord any interested person
the right to petition, in writing, for the issuance, revision, or cancellation of regulatory document that originates,
or would originate, for the Department of the Navy, a policy, requirement, or procedure which is, or would be, within
the purview of &sect;701.66. The official having cognizance of the particular regulatory document involved, or
having cognizance of the subject matter of a proposed document, shall give full and prompt consideration to any such
petition. Such official may, at his or her absolute discretion, grant the petitioner an opportunity to appear, at
his or her own expense, for the purpose of supporting the petition, if this is deemed to be compatible with orderly conduct
of public business. The petitioner shall be advised in writing of the disposition, and the reasons for the disposition,
of any petition within the purview of this section.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 26, 1994, the USEPA published a final rule, through the ``direct final'' procedure, approving two exemption
requests from the requirements contained in Section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act (Act) for the Toledo and Dayton ozone
nonattainment areas in Ohio. See 59 FR 37947. The USEPA is removing this final rule due to adverse comments received
on this action. In a subsequent final rule, USEPA will summarize and respond to the comments received on these exemption
requests from the State of Ohio.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The air quality planning and SIP requirements for ozone nonattainment and transport areas are set out in subparts
I and II of part D of title I of the Clean Air Act, as amended by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAA or ``the Act'').
EPA has published a ``General Preamble'' describing EPA's preliminary views on how EPA intends to review SIPs and
SIP revisions submitted under title I of the CAA, including those State submittals for ozone transport areas within
the States (see 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) (``SIP: General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I of the Clean
Air Act Amendments of 1990''), 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992) (``Appendices to the General Preamble''), and 57 FR 55620
(November 25, 1992) (``SIP: NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Supplement to the General Preamble'')). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has also issued a draft guidance document describing the requirements for the emission statement programs discussed
in this document, entitled ``Guidance on the Implementation of an Emission Statement Program'' (July, 1992). The
Agency is also conducting a rulemaking process to modify part 40 of the CFR to reflect the requirements of the emission
statement program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 182 of the Act sets out a graduated control program for ozone nonattainment areas. Section 182(a) sets out
requirements applicable in marginal nonattainment areas, which are also made applicable in subsections (b), (c),
(d), and (e) to all other ozone nonattainment areas. Among the requirements in section 182(a) is a program in paragraph
(3) of that subsection for stationary sources to prepare and submit to the State each year emission statements showing
actual emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and nitrogen oxides (NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). This paragraph provides that the States are to submit a revision to their SIPs by November 15, 1992 establishing
this emission statement program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CAA requires facilities to submit the first emission statement to the State within three years after November
15, 1990, and annually thereafter. EPA requests that the States submit the emission data to EPA through the Aerometric
Information Retrieval System (AIRS). The minimum emission statement data should include: certification of data
accuracy; source identification information; operating schedule; emissions information (to include annual and
typical ozone season day emissions); control equipment information; and process data. EPA developed emission statements
data elements to be consistent with other source and State reporting requirements. This consistency is essential
to assist States with quality assurance for emission estimates and to facilitate consolidation of all EPA reporting
requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the submission of the emission statement data to AIRS, States should provide EPA with a status report
that outlines the degree of compliance with the emissions statement program. Beginning July 1, 1993, States should
report quarterly to EPA the total number of sources affected by the emission statement provisions, the number that
have complied with the provisions, and the number that have not. This status report should also include the total annual
and typical ozone season day emissions from all reporting sources, both corrected and non-corrected for rule-effectiveness
(RE). States should include in their status report a list of sources that are delinquent in submitting their emission
statement and that emit 500 tons per year (tpy) or more of VOC or 2500 tpy or more of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This report should be a quarterly submittal until all the regulated sources have complied for the reporting year.
Suggested submittal dates for the quarterly status reports are July 1, October 1, January 1, and April 1.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Analysis of State Submission
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are several key general and specific components of an acceptable emission statement program. Specifically,
the State must submit a revision to its SIP and the emission statement program must meet the minimum requirements for
reporting by the sources and the State. In general, the program must include, at a minimum, provisions for applicability,
definitions, compliance, and specific source requirements detailed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Procedural Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act requires States to observe certain procedural requirements in developing its SIP, of which the emission statement
program will become a part. Sections 110(a)(l) and 110(a)(2) of the Act provide that each implementation plan submitted
by a State must be adopted after reasonable notice and public hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of Washington held a public hearing on January 5, 1993 in Vancouver, and January 6, 1993 in SeaTac to solicit
public comment on the implementation plan for the Vancouver Air Quality Maintenance Area and the Central Puget Sound
Ozone Nonattainment Areas, respectively. Following the public hearing, the plan was signed by the Director of the
Washington State Department of Ecology (the Governor's designee) on January 22, 1993. EPA received an official revision
to the SIP on January 28, 1993 which supersedes the SIP submittal of November 16, 1992. Additionally, replacement
pages were submitted July 5, 1994 to clarify which sources are subject to the emission statement program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SIP revision was reviewed by EPA to determine completeness shortly after its submittal, in accordance with the
completeness the criteria set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V (1991), as amended by 57 FR 42216 (August 26, 1991). A
letter dated April 8, 1993 was forwarded to the Governor indicating the completeness of the submittal and the next
steps to be taken in the review process. In today's action, EPA approves Washington's emission statement program
SIP submittal and invites public comment on the action.

B. Components of Emission Statement Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Program Elements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Washington's emission statement program includes provisions covering applicability of the regulations, definitions
for key terms used in the regulations, a compliance schedule for sources covered by the regulations, and the specific
reporting requirements for sources. Under Washington State law, the Revised Code of Washington (RCW) sections 70.94.141
and 70.94.331 authorize Ecology and local authorities to ``require access to records, books, files, and other information
specific to the control, recovery, or release of air contaminants into the atmosphere.'' The Washington Administrative
Code (WAC) 173&hyph;400&hyph;105 states that ``the owner or operator of a source shall upon notification by the director
of Ecology, maintain records ... deemed necessary to determine whether the source is in compliance with applicable
emission limitations and control measures.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Reporting Requirements for Sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the Act, Washington's emission statement program requires sources to submit certification that
the information is accurate to the best knowledge of the individual certifying the statement, source identification
information, operating information, process rate data, control equipment information, and emissions information.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Reporting Requirements for State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Washington's emission statement program includes a provision for the State to provide the identifying information
for the sources covered by the emission statement program, the value for rule effectiveness utilized by the State
in its SIP calculations, the source data elements entered into AIRS, and quarterly emission statement status reports.
The quarterly reports should show the total number of facilities that met the State's emission statements program
requirements and the number of facilities that failed to meet the requirements. Washington has submitted quarterly
emissions statement status reports since July 1, 1993. The emissions statement status reports contain all required
data elements. Ecology and the local air pollution control authorities require emission statement data for the annual
emission inventory update. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Sources Covered
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 182(a)(3)(B) of the Act requires that States with areas designated as nonattainment for ozone (O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) require emission statement data from sources of volatile organic compounds (VOC) or oxides of nitrogen (NOx
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) in the nonattainment areas. Washington's Emission Statement Program applies the source reporting requirements
as outlined in EPA's ``Draft Guidance on the Implementation of an Emission Statement Program.'' Sources subject
to this requirement are: (1) Sources in O3 nonattainment areas that emit 25 (tpy) or more of NOx; and (2) sources in O3
nonattainment areas that emit 25 tpy or more of VOC. Additionally, if a source emits at least the minimum established
reporting level of VOC or NOx (for example, 25 tpy or more in an O3 nonattainment area), and the other pollutant is emitted
at less than 25 tpy, then the other pollutant should also be included in the emission statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Enforceability Issues
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All measures and other elements in the SIP must be enforceable by the State and EPA. The EPA criteria addressing the
enforceability of SIPs and SIP revisions were stated in a September 23, 1987 memorandum (with attachments) from J.
Craig Potter, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, et al. (see 57 FR 13541). SIP provisions must also contain
a program that provides for enforcement of the control measures and other elements in the SIP (see section 110(a)(2)(C)
of the Act). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of Washington has a program in its SIP that will ensure that the requirements of sections 182(a)(3)(B), 182(f),
and 184(b)(2) of the Act for emission statement measures contained in the SIP are adequately enforced. Submission
of emission statement data is enforced through the Southwest Air Pollution Control Authority (SWAPCA) and the Puget
Sound Air Pollution Control Agency (PSAPCA). PSAPCA requires submission by April 15 of each year, and SWAPCA requires
submission by March 15 of each year. EPA expects that the state's existing air enforcement program will be adequate.

III. Final Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565&hyph;13566).
In this action, EPA is granting approval of the emission statement plan revision submitted to EPA on January 28, 1993
because it meets all of the applicable requirements of the CAA.

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements, but
simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does
not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on small entities affected. Moreover,
due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its
actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

The EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment
and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

will become effective on November 14, 1994 unless, by October 12, 1994, adverse or critical comments are received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing is this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any State Implementation Plan. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately
in light of specific technical, economic and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory
requirements.

 This action approves a revision to the Texas SIP addressing CO for El Paso. Certain elements of the complete 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
El Paso CO SIP were submitted by the Governor of Texas to the EPA in order to meet the November 15, 1992, deadline for the
purpose of bringing about the attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for CO. These elements
satisfy certain Federal requirements for an approvable nonattainment area CO SIP for El Paso. This Federal Register
(FR) action approves some of the elements of the complete El Paso CO SIP, including the 1990 base year CO emissions inventory
and the oxygenated fuels program. The remaining elements of the complete El Paso CO SIP have been or will be acted upon

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A segment of El Paso, Texas, was designated nonattainment for CO and classified as moderate with a design value below

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12.7 parts per million (ppm.) (specifically 12.6), under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sections 107(d)(4)(A) and 186(a) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), upon enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.

 Please reference 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991), 57 FR 13498, and 13529 (April 16, 1992). The air quality planning requirements
for moderate CO nonattainment areas with a design value less than or equal to 12.7 ppm. are set out in subparts one and
three of part D, title I of the CAA.

The 1990 Amendments to the CAA made significant changes to the air quality planning requirements for areas that do
not meet (or that significantly contribute to ambient air quality in a nearby area that does not meet) the CO NAAQS (see
Public Law Number 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399). References herein are to the CAA, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 7401

The EPA has issued a ``General Preamble'' describing the EPA's preliminary views on how the EPA intends to review SIPs
and SIP revisions submitted under title I of the CAA, including those State submittals containing moderate CO nonattainment
area SIP requirements. See generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moderate CO nonattainment areas less than 12.7 ppm., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such as El Paso, were required to submit SIPs to the EPA by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November 15, 1992, containing specifically: (1) A comprehensive, accurate, and current inventory of actual emissions
from all sources of CO in the nonattainment area (sections 172(c)(3) and 187(a)(1) of the CAA); (2) no later than September
30, 1995, and no later than the end of each three year period thereafter, until the area is redesignated to attainment,
a revised inventory meeting the requirements of sections 187(a)(1) and 187(a)(5) of the CAA; (3) a permit program
to be submitted by November 15, 1993, which meets the requirements of section 173 for the construction and operation
of new and modified major stationary sources of CO (section 172(c)(5)); (4) contingency measures due November 15,
1993, that are to be implemented if the EPA determines that the area has failed to attain the primary standards by the
applicable date (section 172(c)(9)); (5) a commitment to upgrade the current I/M program and submit a SIP revision
for the I/M program by November 15, 1993, (section 187(a)(4)); and (6) an oxygenated fuels program

Section 110(k) of the CAA sets out provisions governing the EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565&hyph;13566).
The EPA announced its proposed approval of the El Paso CO emission inventory and the oxygenated fuels regulations
on April 4, 1994 (58 FR 15683&hyph;15686) and requested public comments. No comments were received. In this FR action,
the EPA is approving two of the elements of the complete El Paso CO SIP, specifically the 1990 base year CO emissions
inventory, and the oxygenated fuels program. The remaining elements of the complete El Paso CO SIP will be acted upon
in separate FR actions.

Response to Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated previously, the EPA proposed approval of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
El Paso CO emission inventory and the oxygenated fuels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations on April 4, 1994 (59 FR 15683&hyph;15686), and no comments were received regarding the proposed approval.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Final Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 110(k) of the CAA sets out provisions governing the EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565&hyph;13566).
The EPA in this action is approving the following elements of the complete El Paso CO SIP: the 1990 base year CO emissions
inventory and the oxygenated fuels program. These two elements meet all of the applicable requirements of the CAA.
The remaining elements of the complete El Paso CO SIP that were submitted to the EPA by November 15, 1992, or by November
15, 1993, will be or have been acted upon in separate FR actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 23, 1992, the Governor of Texas submitted to the EPA a SIP narrative revision for CO concerning El Paso, which
included the general SIP revision and the oxygenated fuels regulations. The State also submitted to the EPA a completed
emissions inventory on November 17, 1992, and a commitment to upgrade the existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
I/M program on November 15, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA announced its proposed approval of the El Paso CO emission inventory and the oxygenated fuels regulations
on April 4, 1994 (59 FR 15683&hyph;15686) and requested public comments. No comments were received. In that rulemaking
action, the EPA described in detail its interpretation of title I and its rationale for proposing to approve these
elements of the El Paso CO SIP after taking into consideration the specific factual issues presented. It is important
to note that the El Paso CO 1990 base year inventory consists of the following list of the CO peak season daily emissions
estimates in tons per day (t/d): Point Sources, nine t/d; Area Sources, three t/d; Mobile On-Road Sources, 291 t/d;
Mobile Nonroad Sources, 67 t/d; Total Sources, 370 t/d. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final action on the El Paso CO SIP is unchanged from the April 4, 1994, proposed approval action. The EPA prepared
a detailed analysis in its Technical Support Document as a part of its proposed approval and which is available for
review along with the current FR document at the locations referenced in the beginning of this FR document. The discussion
herein provides only a broad overview of the proposed action that the EPA is now finalizing. The public is referred
to the April 4, 1994, proposed approval FR action for a full discussion of the action that the EPA is now finalizing.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting, allowing, or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economical, and environmental factors, and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action makes final the action proposed at 59 FR 15683 (April 4, 1994). As noted elsewhere in this action, the EPA
received no public comments on the proposed action. As a direct result, the Regional Administrator has reclassified
this action from table two to table three under the processing procedures established at 54 FR 2214, January 19, 1989,
and revised via memorandum from the Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation to the Regional Administrators
dated October 4, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA has reviewed these revisions to the El Paso CO SIP and is approving the El Paso CO emission inventory and the oxygenated
fuels regulations in this action. Other elements described above will be or have been addressed in separate FR documents.

number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.

SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D, of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The CAA forbids the EPA to base
its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds (

Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by November 14, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator
of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review, nor does it extend the
time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule
or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements (see section 307(b)(2)).

 of June 30, 1994, EPA issued a final judicially reviewable rule revoking the food additive regulations for benomyl

for the D.C. Circuit ordered EPA on August 24, 1994, to stay the effectiveness of those revocations. By this document,
EPA is implementing the Court's order by reinstating the food additive regulations for benomyl and trifluralin pending
judicial review of EPA's June 1994 Order by that Court.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of June 30, 1994 (59 FR 33684) (``June 1994 Order''), EPA issued a final judicially reviewable rule revoking the food
additive regulations for benomyl (processed tomato products and raisins), trifluralin (peppermint and spearmint
oil), mancozeb (bran of wheat), and phosmet (cottonseed oil). On July 14, 1994, the registrants for benomyl and trifluralin
filed a petition for review of EPA's June 1994 Order with the Circuit Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. In addition,
DuPont and DowElanco filed with the Court a ``Motion for Summary Reversal, or in the Alternative, Stay Pending Review.''
On August 24, 1994, the Court denied Petitioners' Motion for a Summary Reversal, but granted the Motion for a Stay Pending
Judicial Review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By this document, EPA is implementing the Court's Order granting a stay by reinstating the benomyl (processed tomato
products and raisins) and trifluralin (peppermint and spearmint oil) food additive regulations pending judicial
review of EPA's decision. These regulations, therefore, will remain in place until the stay is terminated, EPA is
otherwise ordered by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals or another court, or EPA takes further administrative action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is not reinstating the food additive regulations for mancozeb (bran of wheat) and phosmet (cottonseed oil) because
they were not the subject of the Court's August 24, 1994 decision. Therefore, those regulations continue to be revoked.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Until otherwise acted upon by EPA, the Code of Federal Regulations text will continue to include the full text of the
food additive regulations for benomyl and trifluralin (40 CFR 185.350 and 185.5900).

The Commission adopted this Order on Reconsideration to rule on petitions for reconsideration of a Report and Order
which amended the Commission's pay-per-call regulations to implement the Telephone Disclosure and Dispute Resolution
Act (TDDRA). The Commission affirmed these rules with minor modifications, consistent with the TDDRA. The rules
are intended to maximize telephone subscribers' protection against fraudulent and abusive practices without unduly
burdening common carriers and providers of legitimate pay-per-call services.

1. On August 2, 1994, the Commission adopted an Order on Reconsideration in CC Docket No 93&hyph;22 (released August
31, 1994; FCC 94&hyph;200) (Order) ruling on petitions for reconsideration of a Report and Order, 58 FR 44769 (Aug.
25, 1993), which amended the Commission's pay-per-call regulations to implement the Telephone Disclosure and Dispute
Resolution Act of 1992, 47 CFR 228 (TDDRA). As explained below, the Commission affirmed, with minor modifications,
regulations governing interstate pay-per-call and similar information services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Commission modified &sect;64.1506 to clarify that services specifically exempted from the TDDRA's definition
of ``pay-per-call'' need not be offered exclusively through 900 numbers. The Commission stated that it had not intended
to negate the express exclusions from pay-per-call status enacted by Congress in the TDDRA, and, accordingly, amended
&sect;64.1506 to require that any interstate services possessing the basic pay-per-call attributes set forth in
the statute and &sect;64.1501(a)(1)&hyph;(2), and not subject to the exclusions stated in that section, must be
offered only through telephone numbers beginning with the 900 service access code.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Commission affirmed &sect;64.1508(c) which requires local exchange carriers (LECs) to file federal tariffs
for services that offer subscribers the option of blocking access to 900 numbers and also declined to permit LECs to
satisfy the federal tariffing requirement by cross-referencing applicable state tariffs. The Commission found
that it could implement the TDDRA's mandate that blocking services be reasonably priced most effectively by requiring
the filing of federal tariffs. Federal tariffs assure that the Commission need not review individual state tariffs
or await subscriber complaints to ensure that 900 number blocking is offered to subscribers at a reasonable charge.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Finally, the Commission affirmed, with minor modifications, &sect;64.1510(b) of its rules. This section requires
common carriers billing subscribers for information services provided on either a collect basis or under a presubscription
or comparable arrangement to separate the charges for those services from charges for ordinary telephones services,
to the extent possible, and include in each bill assessing such charges a brief statement of subscriber rights and
responsibilities. Although the Commission recognized that these provisions are not required by the TDDRA, it concluded
that they are necessary to protect consumers from fraudulent and deceptive practices associated with the provision
of interstate information services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Commission noted that subscriber complaints filed with the Common Carrier Bureau over the past several months
confirm and highlight the need for separate billing and consumer notification requirements, particularly when
800 numbers are used to provide information services, purportedly under a presubscription or comparable arrangement.
The Commission's rules require that a valid presubscription arrangement be established as a contractual agreement
between a caller and an information provider (IP) after the caller is fully informed of the rates and conditions for
using the information service and agrees to take the service on the terms offered. The IP must require use of a personal
identification number (PIN) to guard against access by unauthorized persons. However, the complaints received
by the Commission indicate that information providers apparently read the Automatic Number Identification (ANI)
of the originating telephone line and issue a PIN to the caller without ascertaining that that individual is both the
subscriber to the originating line and legally capable of entering into a contractual agreement. The subscriber
to the originating line is then charged for a call to the IP on the basis of ANI and, unless the bill segregates such charges,
the subscriber to the originating line may not be aware that charges for information services have been billed. The
Commission emphasized that this practice does not establish a valid presubscription arrangement and that unless
an IP has ascertained that the subscriber to the originating line is, in fact, the caller who agreed to purchase information
services, the IP may not use ANI in order to bill charges to the originating line. The Commission also noted that LECs
have often used confusing or misleading language in displaying charges for 800 number information services and,
accordingly, directed carriers to render bills that accurately reflect the charges assessed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The Commission also ruled that, while IPs generally appear to have abandoned collect calls as a means of providing
information services, LECs should include in their billing contracts a requirement that entities on whose behalf
collect calls are billed take reasonable steps to segregate any collect calls for information services.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
7. The Commission amended &sect;64.1510(b) to remove the requirement that carriers inform subscribers billed for
collect or presubscribed information services that 900 number blocking is available upon request since that fact
could confuse subscribers because 900 number blocking would not block collect calls or most presubscribed services,
which are typically offered through 800 numbers. The Commission also modified slightly the terminology used in the
rule to reflect more clearly the type of calls it was designed to cover. Thus, the amended rule deletes the term ``interstate
tariffed collect information services'' and instead refers to ``interstate information services provided on a
collect basis.'' To ensure consistency, Sections 64.1507(c) and 64.1511(a) were also amended to incorporate this
changed terminology.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The groundfish fishery in the BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the
Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area (FMP) prepared by the
North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act.
Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1994 bycatch allowance of halibut specified for the trawl pollock/Atka mackerel/``other species'' fishery
category which is defined at &sect;675.21(b)(1)(iii)(F), was established as 957 metric tons by the final 1994 initial
specifications (59 FR 7656, February 16, 1994).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined, in accordance with &sect;675.21(c)(1)(iii), that the bycatch
allowance of halibut specified for the trawl pollock/Atka mackerel/``other species'' fishery category has been
reached. Therefore, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for pollock by trawl vessels using non-pelagic trawl gear
in the BSAI from 12 noon, A.l.t., September 6, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be found in the regulations at &sect;675.20(h).
