SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is proposing regulations concerning the use of overtime and premium pay
in determining the final annual rate of basic pay of customs officers under the Federal Employees Retirement System
(FERS). These regulations would establish the methodology (similar to the one that OPM uses for other flexible schedule
employees) that the employing agency will use to compute customs officers' ``final annual rate of basic pay'' for
determining FERS ``basic employee death benefit.'' The regulations are necessary to implement the changes in the
statutory definition of basic pay under FERS made by section 13812 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 13812 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Pub. L. 103&hyph;66, amended section 8331(3) of title
5, United States Code, the definition of basic pay under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS), to include, as
basic pay for CSRS computations, certain overtime pay for customs officers. Section 8401(4) of title 5, United States
Code, provides that the CSRS definition of basic pay in section 8331(3) applies to the Federal Employees Retirement
System (FERS). For customs officers, basic pay will include the regular pay under the general schedule, any applicable
locality pay, and allowable overtime pay up to $12,500 per fiscal year. Basic pay is used to compute final salary for
the basic employee death benefit under FERS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For determining final salary, the employing agency will use a methodology similar to the one used for determining
the ``final annual rate of basic pay'' of intermittent employees for the FERS basic employee death benefit established
in &sect;843.102 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations. The employing agency will determine the total number of
hours for which the employee was paid two-times-hourly-rate overtime and the total number of hours for which the employee
was paid three-times-hourly-rate overtime during the 52-week workyear ending the pay period before separation.
The employing agency will then determine the amount of overtime pay that the employee would have received during the
52-week workyear if that overtime were paid at two or three times the employee's hourly rate (regular general schedule
pay rate plus locality pay) at the time of death. The amount of allowable overtime is the lesser of the amount that would
have been paid during that 52-week workyear using the employee's hourly rate (times the appropriate multiplier)
at the time of separation or $12,500. The final salary is equal to the allowable overtime computed under the previous
sentence, plus the final annual general schedule pay, plus locality pay.

 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has received and requests public comment on a petition for rulemaking filed
by the Measurex Corporation. The petition has been docketed by the Commission and has been assigned Docket No. PRM&hyph;150&hyph;3.
The petitioner requests that the NRC amend its regulations governing Agreement State regulation of byproduct material
to require Agreement States to notify the NRC of all proposed and completed regulatory actions. The petitioner also
requests that the NRC amend its regulations governing rulemaking to require the NRC to publish Agreement State notices
of proposed and completed rulemaking. The petitioner believes that these amendments would alert NRC and Agreement
State licensees of applicable Agreement State requirements and permit them to more fully participate in the rulemaking
process.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) received a petition for rulemaking dated April 7, 1994, submitted by the
Measurex Corporation. The petition was docketed as PRM&hyph;150&hyph;3 on April 12, 1994. The petitioner requests
that the NRC amend its regulations in 10 CFR part 150 that govern Agreement State regulation of byproduct material.
Specifically, the petitioner is seeking an amendment to 10 CFR 150.31 that will require Agreement States to notify
the NRC of proposed and completed changes to that State's regulations. The petitioner is also seeking an amendment
to 10 CFR part 2 that will require the NRC to publish Agreement State notices of proposed and completed rulemaking in
the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The petitioner notes that current NRC requirements contained in 10 CFR 2.804 through 10 CFR 2.807 establish a procedure
for the publication of proposed changes, participation by interested persons, and notification of changes, and
believes that a less detailed set of rulemaking and notification procedures is specified for Agreement States in
10 CFR 150.31. The petitioner claims that the current rulemaking and notification procedure contained in 10 CFR 150.31
fails to provide a mechanism for persons located outside of any particular Agreement State to learn about proposed
changes in that State's regulations. The petitioner believes that the legislative intent of 10 CFR 150.31 is to provide
a mechanism for interested persons to participate in the rulemaking process. However, the petitioner claims that
because there is no current notification procedure required for Agreement States, the petitioner and other persons
do not have ample opportunity to participate in discussion of proposed rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner states that under both its specific license for device distribution issued by the Agreement State
of California and the general license issued by other Agreement States, it is required to provide generally licensed
device recipients with a copy of the applicable Agreement State regulations. The petitioner also indicates that
although it makes a substantial effort to learn of proposed regulatory changes and to maintain current copies of NRC
and Agreement State regulations, it is not always notified of actual changes that may directly affect it and its customers
in Agreement States. The petitioner believes that the proposed amendments to 10 CFR Parts 2 and 150 would alert NRC
and Agreement State licensees to all relevant Agreement State requirements and permit them to more fully participate
in the rulemaking process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC is soliciting public comment on the petition for rulemaking submitted by Measurex Corporation that requests
the changes to the regulations in 10 CFR Parts 2 and 150 as discussed below.

The Petitioner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The petitioner is a manufacturer, distributor, and supplier of service for process control sensors used by NRC licensees
throughout the United States. The petitioner states that it and its customers are directly affected by regulations
adopted by the NRC and Agreement States. The petitioner also states that both its specific license for device distribution
issued by California, an Agreement State, and other Agreement State licenses require it to provide generally licensed
recipients a copy of the applicable Agreement State regulations. For these reasons, the petitioner claims that it
makes a considerable effort to learn of proposed regulatory changes and to maintain current copies of NRC and Agreement
State regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner indicates that it is submitting this petition for rulemaking to amend 10 CFR Parts 2 and 150 because
it believes that the current regulations completely fail to provide a mechanism for persons located outside any particular
Agreement State to learn about proposed and completed changes to that State's regulations. The petitioner believes
that because there is no adequate mechanism to keep NRC licensees aware of current Agreement State regulations, it
is unable to fully participate in discussion of proposed rules and is often unaware of actual regulatory changes that
directly affect it and its customers in Agreement States.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The petitioner has submitted this petition for rulemaking because it believes that it is adversely affected by the
current regulations that do not provide an adequate mechanism for NRC licensees to learn about proposed and adopted
changes in applicable Agreement State regulations. The petitioner states that although the current NRC regulations
in 10 CFR 2.804 through 2.807 establish a procedure for the notification and publication of regulatory changes and
participation by interested persons, it believes that a less detailed set of rulemaking and notification procedures
is specified for Agreement States in 10 CFR 150.31.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The petitioner's primary concern is that it and other NRC licensees are not always notified of proposed and completed
changes in Agreement State regulations that can directly affect themselves and their customers in Agreement States.
The petitioner is also concerned that because it is often not aware of Agreement State regulatory actions, it does
not have the opportunity to fully participate in the rulemaking process as is intended by NRC regulations. As part
of its petition for rulemaking, the petitioner has included copies of various correspondence with Agreement State
radiation control boards and the NRC, and cites specific cases in the Agreement States of Oregon and Texas that it believes
will illustrate that the current rules are unduly burdensome, deficient, and in need of strengthening. For example,
in Oregon, regulatory changes are proposed that would eliminate the general license authorizing the petitioner
to install, transfer, demonstrate, or provide service and would require the petitioner to obtain a specific license
from Oregon in order to conduct business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If these proposed regulations are adopted, the petitioner states that it will be able to ship sensors to a customer
in Oregon only after confirming that the customer has an appropriate specific license. The petitioner is concerned
not only that the proposed regulations would impose additional burdens and costs on it and its customers in conducting
business in Oregon, but also that it was not provided ample opportunity to comment on the proposed rules or to participate
in the rulemaking process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the petitioner attempted to learn about any proposed or adopted regulatory changes by writing to the Oregon
Radiation Control Section on several occasions between June 1991 and January 1994, it did not receive a response.
The lack of response led the petitioner to believe that Oregon had not modified its 1987 radiological control regulations

was adopted in 1991. The petitioner stated that it only became aware of the changes in Oregon's notification requirements
in February 1994 when informally contacted by an out-of-state health physics colleague. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner also described a case in which it did not learn of regulatory modifications adopted by the Agreement
State of Texas in 1993 until after the rules became effective. These regulations govern distribution and service
involving generally licensed devices. The petitioner claims that the new requirements are costly and administratively
burdensome and again expressed the concern that it was not able to participate in discussions of proposed rules that
affect it and its customers before the rules became effective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner acknowledges that although some State's radiation control agencies are conscientious in notifying
out-of-state distributors or service groups about proposed and completed regulatory changes, many do not make such
an effort. For these reasons, the petitioner indicates that it and other firms have no way of knowing when copies of
a State's regulations are no longer valid and, consequently, have no opportunity to participate in the rulemaking
process. The petitioner stated that its efforts to gain information regarding Agreement State regulatory changes
are costly, time-consuming, and often ineffective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To alleviate this situation, the petitioner proposes that 10 CFR 150.31 be amended to require Agreement States to
notify the NRC of any proposed regulatory actions and that 10 CFR Part 2 be amended to require the NRC to publish the Agreement
State notices of proposed regulatory actions in the

The NRC staff would like to inform the readers that 10 CFR 150.31 applies only to 11e(2) byproduct material (tailings
and other wastes generated from the milling of ores primarily for their source material content) and reflects statutory
requirements in the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978, as amended. Similar requirements could
be developed to apply to other byproduct material. In order to avoid confusion with the requirements for 11e(2) byproduct
material, the proper location for these new requirements would need to be considered in the development of any new
section in Part 150.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Election Commission is seeking comments to help determine whether changes in its regulations governing
disclaimers on campaign communications are warranted. The current rules require a disclaimer notice on communications
by any person that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate, or solicit contributions,
through any form of general public political advertising. One proposed change would create a presumption that communications
by authorized political committees or political party committees that refer to a clearly identified federal candidate
are express advocacy, thereby triggering the disclaimer requirement. Other modifications would clarify that oral
disclaimers are required under appropriate circumstances; clarify how these requirements apply to coordinated
party expenditures; broadly define ``direct mail'' in this context; require a disclaimer on all communications
included in a package of materials that are intended for separate distribution; and clarify the meaning of ``clear
and conspicuous'' as that term is used in these rules.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Election Campaign Act [``FECA'' or ``the Act''] at 2 U.S.C. 441d(a) requires a disclaimer on communications
by any person that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified federal candidate, or solicit
contributions, through any form of general public political advertising. The Commission is proposing to revise
the implementing regulations, found at 11 CFR 110.11, to address issues that have arisen since the rules were last
amended, and to clarify their scope and applicability.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed 11 CFR 110.11(a) includes a definition for the term ``direct mailing.'' For purposes of these requirements,
``direct mailing'' would be broadly defined to include any number of substantially similar pieces of mail, except
for mailings of fifty pieces or less, by any person. The definition would exclude permissible activities by a corporation
or labor organization communicating with a restricted class under 11 CFR 114.3 or 114.5, because such activities
do not involve general public political advertising.

The current disclaimer requirements were enacted as part of the 1976 amendments to the Federal Election Campaign
Act. They replaced those contained in former 18 U.S.C. 612, a broadly-worded criminal code provision that required
identifying information to be included on any political statement published, mailed or distributed on behalf of
a federal candidate.

that are not candidates or political committees. 424 U.S. at 80. However, neither 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Buckley
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nor other pertinent case law prohibits the imposition of further requirements on communications made by candidates
and political committees. It is the Commission's experience that an inordinate amount of Commission time and resources
are diverted to the question of whether a campaign mailing or advertisement paid for by a candidate constituted ``express
advocacy'' and therefore required a disclaimer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since political committees are in the business of electing candidates to political office, the Commission believes
it is appropriate for them to be subject to a different standard under section 441d(a) in certain circumstances. The
Commission is therefore proposing to include in the regulatory text a presumption that all communications by authorized
political committees, or by party political committees, that refer to a clearly identified federal candidate contain
express advocacy, and thus trigger the section 441d(a) disclaimer requirements. This interpretation would further
a major goal of the FECA, that of more complete disclosure on political communications directed to the general public.
It would also eliminate problems that have arisen in determining whether specific communications contain ``express
advocacy'' in this context.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This presumption would be rebuttable, since certain communications, e.g., those limited to one candidate's placing
a newspaper ad offering another sympathy on a bereavement, are clearly not election advocacy. The Commission welcomes
comments on the advisability of adopting this presumption, as well as suggested alternatives to and/or specific
exemptions from the presumption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternatively, the Commission is soliciting comments on whether the statutory language should be interpreted to
require disclaimers on all communications by political committees, whether or not they include express advocacy.
This, too, would further the disclosure aims of the Act, as well as eliminate possible problems in determining whether
the ``express advocacy'' standard has been met.

Party Political Committee Communications

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is also seeking comments on whether the required authorization statement should be dropped or modified
for communications and solicitations that refer to a clearly identified federal candidate, made by political party
committees prior to the time the party's candidate is nominated. There are several possible approaches to this issue.
One option would be for such communications to state only who paid for the communication. Please note that this would
not change the Commission's long-standing conclusion that such communications may count against the committee's
coordinated party expenditure limits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a state or national party committee chooses not to make the coordinated expenditures permitted by section 441a(d),
it may assign its right to make those expenditures to a designated agent, such as the senatorial campaign committee
of the party.

, 454 U.S. 27 (1981). The proposed rules would clarify that the disclaimer on a communication made as a coordinated
party expenditure should identify the committee that made the actual expenditure as the person who paid for the communication,
regardless of whether that committee was acting as a designated agent or in its own capacity.

While the Act requires communications by unauthorized committees to state both who paid for the communication and
whether it was authorized by any candidate or candidate's committee, the text of the current rule does not include
the second requirement for unauthorized committee solicitations. The proposed rule would clarify that an authorization
statement would be required if the solicitation refers to a clearly identified federal candidate.

The ``Clear and Conspicuous'' Requirement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal would provide guidance on the meaning of the term ``clear and conspicuous'' as that phrase is used in current
11 CFR 110.11(a)(1) and proposed paragraph 110.11(c). The Commission recently completed a rulemaking revising
its regulations on the FECA's requirement that treasurers of political committees exercise best efforts to obtain,
maintain, and report the complete identification of each contributor whose contributions aggregate more than $200
per calendar year. 2 U.S.C. 432(i), 11 CFR 104.7. See 58 FR 57725 (Oct. 27. 1993). For purposes of that rulemaking, a
required notice to contributors is stated not to be ``clear and conspicuous'' if it is in small type in comparison to
the remainder of the material, or if the printing is difficult to read or if the placement is easily overlooked. 11 CFR
104.7(b)(1), 58 FR 57729. This NPRM proposes the same language with regard to the disclaimers covered by this section.

Oral Disclaimers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The draft rules would clarify that oral communications and solicitations must meet the same disclaimer requirements
as their written counterparts. The Act does not distinguish between written and oral communications. The Commission
held in Advisory Opinion 1988&hyph;1 that oral disclaimers were not required as part of phone bank campaign communications
with express advocacy content. The draft rules would supersede this opinion. This approach is consistent with the
Commission's recently-adopted ``best efforts'' rules, which require at 11 CFR 104.7(b)(2) that both written and
oral follow-up requests for contributor identification information include a required statement.

if the communications are intended for separate public distribution. In the past, questions have arisen as to whether
a single disclaimer per package would satisfy the purposes of this requirement. All items intended for separate distribution
(e.g., a poster included in a package of campaign handouts) would be covered by this requirement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current rules at paragraph 110.11(a)(2) exempt from the disclaimer requirement small items, such as pins, buttons,
or pens; and ``impractical'' items, such as watertowers and skywriting. The Commission is proposing in paragraph
(b)(1)(i) to add to these exempted items checks, receipts and similar items of minimal value that do not contain a political
message and that are used for purely administrative purposes. Also, the question has at times arisen as to whether
the ``impractical'' exception applies to wearing apparel, such as T-shirts or baseball caps, that contain a political
message. This Notice proposes no language requiring a disclaimer on such material. However, if commenters believe
the Commission should consider a disclaimer requirement for such materials, the Commission would encourage suggestions
for practical application of such a requirement.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is proposing language that would require a disclaimer on a communication by a candidate or party committee
that qualifies as an exempt activity though on behalf of a clearly identified federal candidate. This would ensure
that a disclaimer is included on all communications, including those which qualify as exempt activities by state
and local party committees or candidates under the Act. See 2 U.S.C. 431(8)(B)(v), (x), (xi), and (xii).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed amendment is consistent with the Act's interest in full disclosure of who authorized and paid for campaign
communications. The Commission welcomes comments on this approach.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are invited on any of the specific amendments discussed above, as well as any related issues that might relate
to this topic.

General Rule
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Except as otherwise provided in this section, whenever any person makes an expenditure for the purpose of financing
a communication that expressly advocates the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate or that solicits
any contribution, through any broadcast station, phone bank, newspaper, magazine, outdoor advertising facility,
poster, yard sign, direct mailing or other form of general public political advertising, that communication or solicitation
shall clearly state who paid for it. If authorized by a candidate, an authorized committee of a candidate or an agent
thereof, but paid for by some other person, the communication or solicitation shall clearly state that it is authorized
by such candidate, authorized committee, or agent. If not authorized by a candidate, authorized committee of a candidate
or its agent, the communication or solicitation shall clearly state that it is not authorized by any candidate, candidate's
committee, or agent. For purposes of this paragraph, it is presumed that a communication or solicitation by a political
committee that refers to a clearly identified federal candidate contains express advocacy.

required by paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section shall identify the committee that makes the expenditure as the person
who paid for the communication, regardless of whether the committee was acting in its own capacity or as the designated
agent of another committee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A solicitation other than one covered by paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(D) of this section by an unauthorized political
committee that does not refer to a clearly identified federal candidate need only state who paid for it.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) For purposes of paragraphs (b)(1)(i) of this section, the term ``expenditure'' includes a communication by a
candidate or party committee that qualifies as an exempt activity under 11 CFR 100.8(b) (10), (16), (17), or (18).

to give the reader, observer or listener adequate notice of the identity of the person or committee that paid for, and,
where required, that authorized the communication. A disclaimer is not clear and conspicuous if it is in small type
in comparison to the rest of the printed material, or if the printing is difficult to read or if the placement is easily
overlooked.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The disclaimer need not appear on the front or cover page of the communication as long as it appears within the communication,
except on communications, such as billboards, that contain only a front face.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Each communication that is included in a package of materials but that is also intended for separate public distribution
shall include a disclaimer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) (1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Newspaper or magazine space
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. No person who sells space in a newspaper or magazine to a candidate, an authorized committee of a candidate, or an agent
of the candidate, for use in connection with the candidate's campaign for nomination or for election, shall charge

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Board of Directors (Board) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is seeking comment on whether
the deposit-insurance assessment base currently provided for in the FDIC's assessments regulations should be redefined
and, if so, how. Because of recent statutory amendments and other developments affecting insured depository institutions,
the Board believes review of the assessment-base definition is desirable at this time. The FDIC will carefully consider
comments received in response to this Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Notice) in determining whether revision
of the assessment base is warranted. If the Board finds revision to be warranted, it will propose specific amendments
on which public comment will then be invited.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The insurance premiums paid by an insured depository institution to the FDIC are calculated by multiplying the institution's
assessment base by its assessment rate. At present, an institution's assessment base equals its total domestic deposits,
as adjusted for certain elements. 12 CFR 327.4(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to January 1, 1994, the assessment base was defined by section 7(b) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI
Act), 12 U.S.C. 1817(b). In amending section 7(b) to require the establishment of a risk-based deposit insurance
system, section 302 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA) (Pub. L. 102&hyph;242,
105 Stat. 2236, 2345) removed the statutory assessment-base provisions. As a result, effective January 1, 1994,
the assessment base is now governed by the FDIC by regulation. At present, the FDIC's assessment-base regulations
continue to be based on the former statutory provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the recent transition to a risk-based deposit insurance system, the FDIC believes that it is desirable
to review the existing assessment base. In the Board's view, it is important to determine whether the existing definition
or some alternative definition more effectively furthers the purposes of the new deposit insurance system. In addition,
a number of other significant developments in the financial services industry in recent years_including substantially
higher deposit insurance rates and the resulting heightened awareness of insurance assessments, significant changes
in the activities of insured depository institutions, adjustments in federal failure-resolution policies, and
Congressional adoption of ``depositor preference'' requirements_also support the desirability of such a review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Through this Notice, the FDIC seeks comment from all interested persons as to whether the assessment base should be
redefined and, if so, how. The FDIC believes that it is important to review the definition of the assessment base from
as many different perspectives as possible. Accordingly, this Notice poses various specific questions on which
comment is sought. Commenters are requested to identify the question number to which their respective responses
correspond. Questions need not be repeated, and interested persons are invited to respond to as many questions as
they wish. Further, comment is requested on issues not specifically addressed in this Notice but which a prospective
commenter considers pertinent to the definition of the assessment base.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDIC will carefully review and consider the comments received in response to this Notice in determining whether
to propose a regulatory amendment redefining the assessment base. Should the Board decide that such an amendment
is warranted, it will issue a proposal to adopt specific changes to the assessments regulations and seek public comment
on that proposal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
II. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The assessment base has remained substantially unchanged since 1935. Historically, the assessment base for banks
and thrift institutions has been defined, broadly stated, as total domestic deposits. The existing assessment base,
as defined in 12 CFR 327.4(b), begins with the amount of the ``demand deposits'' and ``time and savings deposits''
reported by an insured institution in its quarterly Report of Condition.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 From these amounts, the regulations provide for additions and subtractions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=2 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=2 -->
For banks, this report is called the Report of Income and Condition; for thrift institutions, the Thrift Financial
Report; and for insured branches of foreign banks, the Report of Assets and Liabilities of U.S. Branches and Agencies
of Foreign Banks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Among the additions to ``demand deposits'' and ``time and savings deposits'' are adjustments for unposted credits.
Among the subtractions are adjustments for unposted debits; pass-through reserve balances; a 162/3 percent ``float''
allowance for demand deposits and a 1 percent ``float'' allowance for time and savings deposits; and the amount of
any liabilities arising from depository institution investment contracts under section 11(a)(8) of the FDI Act.

<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=2 -->
Subtraction for the last item, or certain so-called ``BIC'' liabilities, was included by an amendment to 12 CFR 327.4(b)
effective July 11, 1994. See 59 FR 29714 (June 9, 1994).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The remaining adjustments provided for in 12 CFR 327.4(b) (such as additions for demand deposits that represent uninvested
trust funds) are technical in nature and are included to adapt certain elements of the Reports of Condition for assessment
purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Until 1993, the premium rate by which an institution's assessment base was multiplied to determine its assessment
payment was the same for all banks and the same for all thrifts. Beginning in January 1993, each institution is now assigned
an assessment rate based on the risk that institution poses to its deposit insurance fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As assessment rates have risen over the past few years, deposit insurance premiums have become a significant expense
item for insured depository institutions. The expense factor has resulted in institutions and their depositors
questioning the relevance of the existing assessment base in the current environment. In addition, increased rates
have caused some institutions to take deliberate steps to decrease their assessments by temporarily reducing their
deposits at quarter end.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Also in recent years, there have been significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes in the activities of insured depository 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions, in terms of reported assets and liabilities as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
well as off-balance-sheet operations (including derivative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products such as options, swaps, interest-rate and foreign-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exchange-rate contracts). Such changes, which to some extent have eroded the historical connection between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deposits and lending, give rise to the question of whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
total domestic deposits continues to be a meaningful 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition for the assessment base. Other relevant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developments include adjustments in federal failure-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resolution policies and the adoption of ``depositor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preference'' requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This section discusses the applicability of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developments to the question of whether the assessment base 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be redefined. The areas addressed in this regard are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the role of the assessment base in the risk-related deposit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insurance system, the assessment-avoidance problem, failure- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resolution policies, and depositor preference. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following discussions on these topics identify what the FDIC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes to be important issues that merit careful 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration in deciding on an assessment-base definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment is requested with regard to how the assessment base 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be defined in order to address these and other issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in an appropriate manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before turning to these topics, however, the FDIC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wishes to stress that, in reviewing the definition of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment base, it is not the FDIC's intent to change the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
total dollar amount of assessments collected. Instead, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
goal is to select an assessment base that best suits the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes of federal deposit insurance. To the extent any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decrease or increase in assessment income is warranted, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDIC anticipates that it would achieve that decrease or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase by changing the assessment rates, and not by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
redefining the assessment base. In short, the amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
total assessment collections a particular assessment base 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition would yield (assuming no change in the assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates) is not a criterion the FDIC intends to apply in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deciding on an assessment-base definition, since assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collections can be fairly readily adjusted by changing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the FDIC does not intend any redefinition of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment base to have a significant impact on the total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of assessments industry-wide, there is a potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for significant change in the assessments paid on an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution-by-institution basis. Depending on the type of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities in which a particular institution is engaged, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the type of products and services it offers, a change in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment base could have a significant effect on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of the assessments it pays.

A. Risk-Based Assessment System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 302 of FDICIA amended section 7 of the FDI Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to require that the FDIC establish a risk-based assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system. Under the system mandated by FDICIA, the amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an institution's assessment is to be based on the likelihood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that its deposit insurance fund will incur a loss with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respect to the institution, the likely amount of any such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loss, and the revenue needs of the insurance funds. Under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the risk-based system adopted by the FDIC pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 302, the rate component of the insurance system was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changed from a single, flat rate applicable to all banks and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a single, flat rate applicable to all thrift institutions to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a risk-based rate structure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Having already addressed the rate component of the new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk-based assessment system in previous rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proceedings, the FDIC is now turning its attention to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment-base component. This Notice does not revisit the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
matter of the rate structure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At present, the assessment-base component of the risk-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based system remains unchanged from the form required by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statute for the former flat-rate insurance system. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue to be considered in connection with whether the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment base should now be changed is how and to what 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extent the assessment base should reflect the risk factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified in section 7(b) of the FDI Act, as amended by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 302 of FDICIA.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
For example, among the risks identified in section 7(b) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are those attributable to ``different categories and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations of liabilities, both insured and uninsured *&blank;*&blank;*.'' 12 U.S.C. 1817(b)(1)(C)(i)(II).
One area of risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taken into account in the existing assessment base is that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involving deposit liabilities. Potentially, the assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
base could be modified to take into account other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``categories'' of liabilities, such as non-deposit, secured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liabilities. This example is discussed more fully in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph C of section IV, below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
B. Assessment Avoidance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Whatever assessment base is applied, the FDIC believes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that, in order to avoid imposing any additional regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burden on insured institutions, it is desirable to continue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to collect assessment data from institutions in their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quarterly Reports of Condition. If the assessment-base 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition is changed, the information collected for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment purposes by the Reports of Condition might also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need to be changed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At present, the data collected in these reports reflect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amounts ``as of'' the report date. This has caused some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions purposefully to reduce their assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenses by temporarily reducing the amount of the deposits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
held on the report date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has been suggested that defining the assessment base 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in terms of a daily average over the quarter (that is, total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dollars for the quarter divided by the number of days in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quarter), rather than actual ``as of'' report-date data, would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mitigate this assessment-avoidance problem. An averaging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach would also help to smooth out the effects of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unusual occurrences such as misdirected wire transfers and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the receipt, on or just before the report date, of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
abnormally large deposits to be held only briefly by an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
C. Failure-Resolution Policies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In past years, governmental policies for resolving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failed or failing depository institutions frequently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided protection for liabilities not specifically covered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by federal deposit insurance. First, through the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all-deposit purchase-and-assumption (P&amp;A) transactions, all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
depositors_insured and uninsured alike_often received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
full protection for their deposit balances. Unlike a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deposit payoff or an insured-deposit transfer, in which only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insured deposits were covered (and which were used only when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there was no acceptable bid for an all-deposit P&amp;A), the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all-deposit P&amp;A allowed for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 100-percent insurance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection. The protection of all depositors in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resolution of several large bank failures contributed to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perception that some banks were ``too big to fail'' and thus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 100-percent insurance protection for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all deposits, both domestic and foreign. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the use of all-deposit P&amp;As and application of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the so-called ``too big to fail'' doctrine often resulted in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection for liabilities beyond the statutory limit for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deposit insurance coverage, in all such cases it did so in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfaction of a cost test or for clear policy objectives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such as maintaining the stability of, and public confidence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in, the banking system. Specifically, the FDI Act required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that, subject to an ``essentiality'' exception, the resolution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of an institution be no more costly to the FDIC than its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liquidation. Hence, the FDIC could normally effect an all- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deposit P&amp;A only if the purchase premium paid by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acquirer for the transaction offset the additional cost to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the FDIC of protecting uninsured liabilities, in comparison 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the cost of a liquidation. In the handful of ``too big 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to fail'' cases where this cost test was not met, the FDIC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acted under a statutory exception to the cost test based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the ``essentiality'' of the failing institution to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marketplace. That exception was used only in a small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minority of the total number of resolutions the FDIC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effected.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Still, the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 protection of uninsured liabilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fueled the argument that such protected liabilities should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be assessed. Since the assessment base already consisted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(as it still does) generally of total domestic deposits, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
universe of non-assessed liabilities was limited to foreign 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deposits and non-deposit liabilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 141(a) of FDICIA amended section 13(c) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDI Act to impose a revised test for failure resolution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Instead of requiring that the resolution be no more costly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than liquidation, the new test requires use of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resolution method that is least costly to the affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deposit insurance fund. Provisions for present-value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyses and documentation are specified in order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine the least-costly resolution method. The FDIC may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not protect uninsured deposits unless it is less costly to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide such protection than not to do so. Further, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDIC is prohibited from pursuing any action, directly or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indirectly, that would have the effect of increasing losses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the insurance fund by protecting foreign deposits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(generally meaning deposits payable only outside the United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States). Hence, all-deposit P&amp;A transactions are still 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permitted, provided the insurance fund does not incur any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loss with respect to such deposit liabilities in an amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater than the loss which would have been incurred with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respect to such liabilities if they had not been assumed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the acquirer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The perceived ``too big to fail'' doctrine has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replaced by a new statutory exception for situations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involving ``systemic risk''. In such cases_as determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by consensus among the FDIC, the Board of Governors of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal Reserve System, and the Secretary of the Treasury 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(in consultation with the President)_the FDIC may take 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action or provide assistance as necessary to avoid or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mitigate the systemic effects of failure. However, the FDIC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is required to recover the losses incurred under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systemic risk exception through one or more special 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessments on the members of the affected insurance fund. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As yet, this exception has not been used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The net result going forward is that for any individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resolution, protection will be provided only for insured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deposits unless it is less costly to protect uninsured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deposits as well. In any instance (expected to be quite 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rare) in which the ``systemic risk'' exception might be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
triggered, the FDIC is required to recover the loss to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable deposit insurance fund by means of a special 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment on the members of that fund. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has been argued in the past that the assessment base 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be expanded beyond total domestic deposits in order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to conform the base to the actual protections provided by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the FDIC under the failure-resolution policies. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
many now believe that, given the new failure-resolution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policies, this rationale for expanding the base has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weakened. (Of course, a shrinking of the assessment base 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
might be viewed as warranted under the failure-resolution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements, or an expansion might be warranted for other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasons.)

D. Depositor Preference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In August 1993, Congress enacted legislation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishing the priority order for payment on claims 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against an institution in receivership. As amended by this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legislation, section 11(d)(11) of the FDI Act now provides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the priority of deposit liabilities of the institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over other general or senior liabilities. (Subject to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cross-guarantee provisions of section 5(e) of the FDI Act, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claims with priority over deposit liabilities are secured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claims to the extent of the security, and administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenses of the receiver.) This situation raises the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
question of whether, or to what extent, the assessment base 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should reflect the protection granted by this provision to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uninsured deposits.

A. Evaluation Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is the FDIC's intention to apply an assessment base 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition that addresses the requirements of the deposit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insurance program over the long run, rather than one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed only to respond to the current conditions in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
banking industry. To this end, the FDIC has identified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain characteristics that it believes can be used as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria for analyzing and comparing alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definitions. These criteria, which address the issues and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerns discussed in the preceding section, are outlined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
below. They are applied in the final section of this Notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a framework for analyzing various alternative assessment-base definitions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the questions at the end of this section, comment is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sought on the usefulness of these criteria in selecting an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment-base definition, as well as on whether additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or alternative criteria should be applied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Fairness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This criterion refers to the extent to which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions are neither systematically favored nor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systematically disadvantaged due to factors such as size and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
geographic location. Under this concept of fairness, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similar institutions operating under similar circumstances, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and representing similar risks of failure and magnitude of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential loss to the insurance fund, would generally incur 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similar insurance costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fairness may suggest that claims receiving potentially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equal protection in the event of a failure be assessed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equally. Similarly, since there are varying degrees of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection for different categories of claims, it could be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
argued that fairness demands higher assessment payments for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater degrees of protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fairness may also refer to the extent to which abnormal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurrences, such as the receipt at quarter end of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unusually large deposit to be held only briefly by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution, affect the amount of an institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessments. In this regard, fairness may suggest that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment base should be defined in terms of averages, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which would help smooth out the effects of such abnormal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurrences, rather than on actual ``as-of'' report-date data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Measurability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This criterion refers to the extent to which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
components of the assessment base can feasibly and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
objectively be calculated with a minimum degree of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uncertainty and disagreement by separate, independent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parties (such as the institution being assessed and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDIC). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, an assessment base that is limited to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insured deposits might raise measurability concerns, since 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
timely and reliable calculations of only those deposits (or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portions of deposits) that actually would be covered by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insurance in the event of a failure might not be feasible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(To the extent measurability is not an issue, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recordkeeping necessary to support such a calculation might 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be.) If measurability is a problem here, a possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solution might be to identify a ``proxy'' intended to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a less precise (but related) substitute that is more readily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available than actual insured deposits.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This criterion refers to the extent to which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment base reflects the degree of risk posed to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deposit insurance funds. For example, there is a link 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between the existing assessment base, which is based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
total domestic deposits, and the magnitude of the loss the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failure of an institution could cause its deposit insurance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fund. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the one hand, private insurance firms often base the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of their premiums at least in part on the amount to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be paid out under the policy if the insured event 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transpires. This practice might suggest an assessment base 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consisting of insured deposits only. Such a definition also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be consistent with the primary purpose of federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deposit insurance as clarified by FDICIA_to protect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insured deposits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, existing public policy provides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection for liabilities other than insured deposits, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through such measures as depositor preference_which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides some protection to non-insured domestic deposits_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and granting superior status to secured liabilities. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, to the extent that secured claims are elevated to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a position superior to that of insured deposits, the FDIC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be at greater risk of not recovering the full amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its payout on insured deposits. Thus, assessment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liabilities other than insured deposits is not inherently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inconsistent with the concept of defining the assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
base in terms of the magnitude of the risk posed to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDIC.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Non-Avoidability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This criterion refers to the extent to which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment base precludes or minimizes transactions or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjustments made solely to avoid assessments. Under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing assessment base, which is defined in terms of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deposits held ``as of'' the last day of the quarter, avoidance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities usually involve the temporary transfer of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deposits out of an institution's deposit base for a brief 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period extending over quarter end. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One such example is the movement of deposits into non-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deposit instruments (such as notes or repurchase agreements) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the same institution just prior to quarter end, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solely for the purpose of reducing the assessment paid by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution. The transferred funds are returned to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deposit accounts at the beginning of the next quarter, after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the ``as of'' date for determining the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment base. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another example, which involves the transfer of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deposits from one insured institution to another, does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affect the total amount of assessments collected by the FDIC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but rather forces the receiving institution to pay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessments on deposits that would otherwise have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in the transferring institution's assessment base. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this example, deposits are transferred just prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quarter end from one institution to another. The transfer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is reversed shortly thereafter. The result is to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disadvantage the (probably unsuspecting) receiving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution by increasing the deposit base on which its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessments are calculated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In both of these examples, the result is an artificial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situation created solely for the purpose of avoiding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessments. Such situations could be mitigated by the use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of ``average'' data in defining the assessment base.

5. Recordkeeping Burden 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This criterion refers to the ease of maintaining and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting the data needed for computing an institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment base. It encompasses the time and effort 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary for any additional recordkeeping beyond that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required of reporting entities for purposes other than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessments.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FDIC fully appreciates the need to keep to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum any additional recordkeeping requirements. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursuant to section 7(b)(5) of the FDI Act, as amended by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDICIA, each insured depository institution must maintain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all records the FDIC may require for verifying the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correctness of the institution's assessments. Depending on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
how the assessment base is defined, additional recordkeeping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
might be necessary to allow for the verification of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment-related information reported by an institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If, in responding to any portion of this Notice, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment recommends a particular recordkeeping requirement, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the commenter is requested to include an estimate of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of time it would take a reporting entity to meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement.

B. Questions for Comment Regarding the Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Response to the following questions is requested: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Are the definitions of the aforementioned criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient in terms of evaluating the various options for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defining the assessment base? If not, provide suggested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definitions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Are there any other criteria that should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered in evaluating the various options for defining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the assessment base? If so, identify and define those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Alternative Assessment-Base Definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section presents several options for defining the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment base. It does not attempt to address all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible options, but rather discusses those the FDIC has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified to date as the primary alternatives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following a discussion of each of these options are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
several specific questions pertaining to that option. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Response to these questions is requested from all interested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
persons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

A. Status Quo 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this option, the assessment base would remain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unchanged, and it would continue to be defined, broadly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated, as total domestic deposits. Because there would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no changes, the FDIC's existing assessment-base regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not be amended.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Retaining the existing definition would avoid another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory change for insured depository institutions. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing definition is generally well understood and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operable, and has relatively few measurement problems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, because quarter-end data are used to calculate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current assessment base, there is a high risk of assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
avoidance, and the problem of receiving abnormally large 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deposits or misdirected wire transfers at quarter end would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be addressed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Relative to assessable deposits, there has been recent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
growth of other liabilities and off-balance-sheet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities. If this is a long-term trend, it might not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
desirable to link assessments to a base that may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shrinking in relation to overall banking activity unless the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection provided in connection with the federal deposit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insurance program is reduced commensurately. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters are requested to provide an evaluation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this option for defining the assessment base, in terms of

Commenters are also requested to respond to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following specific questions regarding this option: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Should the float deductions be retained at their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing levels, or should they be modified? (The deduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for adjusted demand deposits is 162/3 percent and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deduction for adjusted time and savings deposits is 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent.) State the advantages and disadvantages of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended method for addressing the float deduction for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the status quo option. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

B. Total Unadjusted Domestic Deposits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this option, the assessment base would be defined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in its existing form (status quo), except that current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment base adjustments would be eliminated. The float 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deductions, which were established over 30 years ago, are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the most significant adjustments to the assessment base 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided for in the current regulations. Since that time, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there have been dramatic changes in the payments system in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the United States that may have caused the current float 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deductions to become obsolete. Therefore, many advocate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elimination of these float deductions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other existing adjustments to the assessment base 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a less dramatic effect on the total assessments paid by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions. However, these adjustments complicate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurability of the assessment base and increase the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting and recordkeeping burden. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

C. Expanded Base: Non-Deposit Secured Liabilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this option, the assessment base would consist, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in general terms, of total adjusted domestic deposits plus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-deposit secured liabilities (such as secured notes and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other secured borrowings). One argument given for assessing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
secured liabilities is that they are protected before the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDIC in the event of a failure and, accordingly, increase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the risk of loss to the FDIC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secured creditors of insured depository institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are protected against loss by assets of the institution that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are pledged as security for its debts to those creditors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because more favorable terms can be obtained on borrowings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by pledging high-quality, marketable assets as security, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there is a tendency for institutions to pledge such assets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for that purpose. If the institution were to fail, these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pledged assets would not be available to reduce the FDIC's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
losses or to settle the claims of other unsecured creditors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As more of the institution's assets are pledged_often, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the highest-quality, most marketable assets_there are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fewer assets remaining to satisfy unsecured obligations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including unsecured deposit and non-deposit liabilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The likely effect of a shrinking pool of quality assets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the FDIC is to increase its failure-resolution costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDIC costs could be increased even further if, as is often 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the case, the market realizes beforehand that an institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be heading toward insolvency. Uninsured and unsecured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
creditors typically flee an institution perceived to be in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trouble, leaving the institution more dependent on secured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrowings for funding, and further depleting the pool of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unpledged assets available for settling claims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDICIA allows secured claims to be paid up to the fair 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
market value of the assets pledged against those claims. 12 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S.C. 1821(d)(5)(D). Any remaining portion is to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treated as an unsecured claim. This marginally reduces the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDIC's exposure by restricting secured claimholders' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recoveries to the market value of the pledged assets, but by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no means eliminates the exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the assessment base were expanded to include secured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liabilities, a better measure of these liabilities would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary. While rough estimates of secured liabilities are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtainable, an institution's secured, non-deposit borrowings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cannot at present be readily determined from data available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the institution's Report of Condition. As a result, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the assessment base were defined to include non-deposit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
secured liabilities, additional data (and additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recordkeeping) would probably be required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Commenters are also requested to respond to the following specific question regarding this option: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
26. Identify other advantages or disadvantages of this option for defining the assessment base. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Expanded Base: Foreign Deposits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this option, the assessment base would equal, in general terms, total adjusted domestic deposits plus foreign
deposits. Despite the fact that obligations payable only outside the United States and certain other limited areas
(including ``foreign deposits'') are not covered by federal deposit insurance, they have sometimes been protected
in the past by federal failure-resolution policies. Since virtually all foreign deposits are held by large banks
and since large-bank failures historically have been handled in a way that protected most depositors, it has been
argued that these deposits should be assessed. Those who support this argument believe that assessing foreign deposits
would help to equalize a perceived inequality in treatment between large and small depository institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, recent changes in the failure-resolution process have eroded this argument. Under FDICIA, protection
of uninsured deposits, including foreign deposits, is permitted only in cases where a least-cost determination
warrants such protection or where the systemic-risk exception is triggered. In cases falling within the systemic-risk
exception (which are expected to be quite rare), FDICIA requires special assessments on the members of the affected
insurance fund to cover the costs of protecting any uninsured deposits. (The statute requires the special assessment
without reference to the fund's resources; thus, whether or not foreign deposits are included in the assessment base
is totally irrelevant to the applicability of the special assessment, which is apparently intended to be imposed
on all members of the affected fund.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another possible argument for assessing foreign deposits is to offset any losses resulting from a foreign government's
seizure of failed U.S. institutions' assets located within the jurisdiction of that foreign government. While the
possible seizure of assets by a host country is a risk that should not be overlooked, neither should it be exaggerated.
In the event of such a failure, it is not clear who would control the liquidation of foreign-branch assets.

Increased costs associated with assessing foreign deposits could reduce the ability of U.S. depository institutions
to compete in foreign and international markets and could adversely affect their ability to promote exports from
the United States. There is reason to believe that assessment of foreign deposits would cause many depository institutions
to convert their foreign offices to subsidiary depository institutions, thus perhaps substantially reducing the
amount of foreign deposits subject to assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, many would argue that if foreign deposits are assessed, they should also be insured. At present, federal
statute explicitly precludes the insurance coverage of foreign deposits. A change in this situation would require
Congressional action and would raise a variety of issues, including the reaction of foreign governments to U.S. depository
institutions offering insured deposits in competition with that country's domestic depository institutions.

E. Expanded Base: Total Liabilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this option, the assessment base would equal total liabilities (domestic and foreign).
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 An argument can be made for an assessment-base definition that is based on all of an institution's funding sources
(e.g., total liabilities, not including capital) as opposed to deposits alone. As an institution encounters difficulties,
a ``flight to quality'' often occurs, with uninsured depositors and unsecured creditors leaving the institution.
In turn, fewer depositors and other creditors are actually unprotected, or face losses, at the time of failure. As
a result, as assets are liquidated to fund the withdrawal of uninsured deposits, this flight to quality reduces the
amount of unpledged assets that are available for settling claims, which increases the FDIC's resolution costs.
This argues for assessing institutions' liabilities that are protected directly by deposit insurance (insured
deposits), as well as indirectly (uninsured deposits and secured liabilities), in the event of a failure.

To the extent this option includes foreign deposits, the observations made in the preceding discussion of such deposits
also apply to this option.

FDIC experience with depository institution failures supports the premise that all types of an institution's liabilities
are used to fund the activities that cause depository institution failures and, thereby, produce losses for the FDIC.
Given this situation, it has been suggested that all of a depository institution's liabilities should be assessed
by the FDIC. This would also remove any artificial incentives for institutions to favor certain types of liabilities
(e.g., non-deposits) over other types of liabilities (e.g., deposits) for purposes of assessment avoidance.

F. Insured Deposits Only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this option, the assessment base would equal insured deposits only. To the extent that protection of obligees
in the event of an institution failure is limited to insured deposits, this definition would provide a balance between
protection and assessment. However, to the extent non-insurance protection is given to non-insured liabilities,
that balance is undermined. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential risk to the FDIC from non-insured liabilities of a depository institution, such as secured borrowings,
would be disregarded under this option. In addition, other protected obligations, such as uninsured deposits potentially
sheltered by depositor preference, would not be assessed. With regard to uninsured deposits, one might argue that
the protection they receive is provided at no cost or risk to the deposit insurance funds, and that such a risk comes
only from insured deposits and secured liabilities. Others might argue that they all fall within the scope of the protection
provided by the ``federal safety net'' and that such protection should somehow be taken into account in determining
an institution's deposit insurance premiums. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whatever the merits of these arguments might be, coming up with a timely and accurate figure for only that portion of
an institution's deposits that actually would be covered by deposit insurance were the institution to fail may pose
significant reporting problems. For example, concerns have been expressed regarding the difficulty of compiling
data that accurately distinguish between insured and uninsured deposits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At present, the Reports of Condition require data indicating the total amount of the institution's deposits and its
uninsured deposits. However, the report formula for computing uninsured deposits results in estimated amounts
and may not be sufficiently precise for purposes of determining an institution's assessment base. Providing an acceptable
level of precision may require an institution to increase its data collection and analysis efforts, resulting in
increased regulatory burden.

47. In order to alleviate any additional reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burden associated with reporting precise amounts of insured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deposits under this option, would it be desirable to develop 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a ``proxy'' for insured deposits for assessment purposes? If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
so, what would be an acceptable method of approximation? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
48. Identify other advantages or disadvantages of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
G. Assessment Base of Total Assets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this option, the assessment base would equal an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's total assets. Conceptually, an argument can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be made for charging premiums against those items which pose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a risk of loss to the deposit insurance funds, such as an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's assets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An assessment base defined in terms of assets might be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more easily understood and less prone to manipulation for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment-avoidance purposes than liability-based measures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on Report of Condition data, it could be easily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measured and perhaps more predictable than a deposit-based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition. It also would insulate the assessment base from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liability-structure decisions of the institution, creating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an assessment base that is neutral with respect to an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's liabilities. Because all assets would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in the base, this definition also could reduce the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk of assessment avoidance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While conceptually appealing, this approach would be a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial departure from tradition, and there would be no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
direct relationship between those items assessed and those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
items insured. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters are requested to provide an evaluation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this option for defining the assessment base, in terms of

55. As discussed in this section, there can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advantages to an assessment base founded on assets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, given that numerically, total liabilities is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent to total assets, net of equity, what would be the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advantages and disadvantages of using total assets, net of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equity, instead of total liabilities, to define the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment base? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
56. Would an assessment base defined in terms of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assets be more reflective of risk to the deposit insurance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds, and, if so, how?

V. Miscellaneous Requests for Comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the comments requested elsewhere in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice, response to the following questions is invited: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
58. Should the assessment base be calculated using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
daily average data for the quarter (total dollars for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quarter divided by the number of days in the quarter), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rather than ``as-of'' quarter-end data? What are the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advantages and disadvantages of each of these approaches? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Are there preferable alternative approaches, and if so, what 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are they and what are their advantages and disadvantages? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
59. If daily averages over the quarter were used, what 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional recordkeeping would be necessary for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution? (Please describe and quantify.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
60. To what extent, if any, should off-balance-sheet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
items be factored into the assessment base? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
61. If the assessment base is redefined, is there a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need for a transition period from application of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing base to application of the new base? If so, how 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should the transition period be implemented and how long 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should it be? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
62. Should there be an assessment base for large 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions and a different assessment base for small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions? If so, what should the respective assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bases be? How should ``large institution'' and ``small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution'' be defined for this purpose? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
63. What are the implications (if any) of a change in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the assessment base on the ability of insured depository 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions to innovate and to keep up with changes in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marketplace? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
64. Since there are varying degrees of protection for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different types of claims resulting from a depository 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution failure, would ``fairness'' require that there be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some mechanism in the assessment system for adjusting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessments to correspond to the degree of protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided? If so, what should that mechanism be? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
65. Are there other desirable options for defining the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment base, including modifications to the options 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presented in this Notice? If so, identify and explain the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
options and describe their advantages and disadvantages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
66. What would be the impact of a change in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of the assessment base on competition within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States? Describe the impact on domestic competition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relative to the assessment base options discussed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section IV and any additional options suggested by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
67. What would be the impact of a change in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of the assessment base on global competition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particularly with regard to foreign deposits? Describe the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact on global competition relative to the assessment base 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
options discussed in section IV and any additional options 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested by the commenter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes to amend the Customs Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pertaining to Customs field organization by establishing a new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
port of entry in the Customs District of Chicago, Illinois, North Central Region. The new port of entry would be designated
as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rockford, Illinois and would include Greater Rockford Airport, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which is currently operated as a user-fee airport. This change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will assist the Customs Service in its continuing efforts to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieve more efficient use of its personnel, facilities, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resources, and to provide better service to carriers, importers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the general public.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To achieve more efficient use of its personnel, facilities, and resources, and in order to provide better service
to carriers, importers and the public in the North Central Region, Customs proposes to amend &sect;122.15, Customs
Regulations (19 CFR 122.15), by removing Greater Rockford Airport from the list of user-fee airports and &sect;101.3,
Customs Regulations (19 CFR 101.3) to add Rockford, Illinois, as a port of entry. The new port would be designated as
Rockford, Illinois and would include Greater Rockford Airport. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The criteria used by Customs in determining whether to establish a port of entry are found in T. D. 82&hyph;37 (47 FR
10137), as revised by T. D. 86&hyph;14 (51 FR 4559) and T. D. 87&hyph;65 (52 FR 16328). Under these criteria, a community
requesting a port of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entry designation must: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Demonstrate that the benefits to be derived justify the Federal Government expense involved; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Be serviced by at least two major modes of transportation (rail, air, water or highway); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Have a minimum population of 300,000 within the immediate service area (approximately a 70 mile radius); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Make a commitment to make optimal use of electronic data transfer capabilities to permit integration with Customs
Automated Commercial System (ACS), which provides a means for electronic processing of entries of imported merchandise.
Further, the actual or potential Customs workload (minimum number of transactions per year) at the proposed port
of entry must meet one of several alternative minimum requirements, one of which is the condition that no more than
half of the required 2,500 consumption entries can be attributable to one private party. Lastly, facilities at the
proposed port of entry must include cargo and passenger facilities, warehousing space for the secure storage of imported
cargo pending final Customs inspection and release, and administrative office space, inspection areas, storage
areas and other space necessary for regulatory Customs operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal set forth in this document originated as a request from the Rockford Airport Authority that Rockford,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Illinois be designated as a port of entry. With regard to the above criteria, the Rockford Airport Authority has stated
that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Federal Government would benefit from the port of entry designation because Rockford, Illinois would thus be
available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to share the workload presently handled at the port of entry at Chicago, Illinois. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to a memorandum from the Regional Commissioner, North Central Region, in addition to the airport, Rockford
has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two other transportation modes, rail and highway. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the Rockford Chamber of Commerce, the 1990 census figures indicate that the population of the city of
Rockford is 139,426 and that of the Rockford metropolitan area is stated to be 283,719. A 70 mile radius would include
several Illinois and Wisconsin cities and several northwestern suburbs of Chicago. Counting the communities within
a 70 mile radius would bring the area population to well over 300,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The number of formal Customs entries in fiscal year 1992 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was 3539, with a representation that no more than 8.4% were attributable to one private party. Regarding electronic
data transfer capability, the Greater Rockford Airport Authority is committed to making optimal use of electronic
data transfer capability to permit integration with ACS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lastly, according to the Regional Commissioner's office, since Greater Rockford Airport is currently a Customs
user-fee airport, it already has a workload. It is likely that Rockford will continue to grow. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The District Director at Chicago has verified that Rockford's entries for the year 1992 exceeded 2,500 formal entries,
and the Regional Commissioner for the North Central Region has advised that Rockford appears to meet the criteria
for port of entry status. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, Customs believes that there is sufficient justification for the establishment of the requested
port of entry. Rockford, Illinois meets an appropriate combination of the workload criteria specified.

Customs routinely establishes, expands, and consolidates Customs ports of entry throughout the United States to
accommodate the volume of Customs-related activity in various parts of the country. Thus, although this document
is being issued with notice for public comment, because it relates to agency management and organization it is not
subject to the notice and public procedure requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553. Accordingly this document is not subject
to the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Order 12866.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA proposes to revise EPA's definition of volatile organic compounds (VOC) for purposes of preparing State implementation
plans (SIP's) to attain the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for ozone under title I of the Clean Air
Act (Act) and for the Federal implementation plan (FIP) for the Chicago ozone nonattainment area. This revision adds
parachlorobenzotrifluoride (PCBTF) and volatile methyl siloxanes (VMS) to the list of compounds excluded from
the definition of VOC on the basis that these compounds have negligible contribution to tropospheric ozone formation.
In the final rules section of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 the EPA is approving this definition revision as a final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views this
as a noncontroversial revision amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval
is set forth in the final rule. If no adverse comments or requests for a public hearing are received in response to the
final rule, no further activity is contemplated in relation to this proposed rule. If EPA receives adverse comments
or requests for public hearing on the final rule, the final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received
will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule. The 30 day comment period established by this
notice will be the only comment period instituted by EPA. Any requests for extensions of the comment period will be
considered. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this notice. Any parties interested in commenting
on this notice should do so at this time.
