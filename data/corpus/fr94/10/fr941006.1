SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are proposing to amend the regulations concerning interstate movement of horses that test positive for equine
infectious anemia to allow the horses to be moved interstate directly to slaughter under a permit and in a sealed conveyance,
as an alternative to the horses being officially identified prior to the interstate movement with a hot iron or chemical
brand, freezemarking, or a lip tattoo. This proposed change in the regulations would provide owners of equine infectious
anemia reactors with an alternative means of handling their animals while preventing the spread of this communicable
disease.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations in 9 CFR part 75 (referred to below as the regulations) contain provisions for the interstate movement
of horses, asses, ponies, mules, and zebras that test positive for communicable diseases, including equine infections
anemia (EIA). The purpose of these provisions is to prevent the spread of communicable diseases, including EIA. A
viral disease of equines, EIA, also known as swamp fever, may be characterized by sudden fever, swelling of the legs
and lower parts of the body, severe weight loss, and anemia. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 75.4(a) of the regulations defines an EIA reactor as any horse, ass, mule, pony or zebra which is subjected
to an official test and found positive. Under &sect;75.4(b) of the regulations, no EIA reactor may be moved interstate
unless the reactor is officially identified and meets certain other requirements. Section 75.4(a) of the regulations
defines ``officially identified'' as the permanent identification of a reactor with markings permanently applied
by an Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) representative, a State representative, or an accredited
veterinarian using a hot iron or chemical brand, freezemarking or a lip tattoo. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
APHIS believes that EIA reactors could be moved interstate to slaughter under a permit and in a sealed conveyance,
as an alternative to being officially identified prior to the interstate movement. Moving EIA reactors interstate
to slaughter under a permit and in a sealed conveyance would ensure that the animals are not diverted for other uses.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, we are proposing to amend the requirements for interstate movement in &sect;75.4(b) by adding a provision
stating that ``Official identification is not necessary if the animal is moved directly to slaughter, traveling
under a permit and in a sealed conveyance.'' In addition, we propose to add definitions to &sect;75.4(a) for ``official
seal'' and ``permit.'' An official seal would be defined as a ``serially numbered metal or plastic strip, or a serially
numbered button, consisting of a self-locking device on one end and a slot on the other end, which forms a loop when the
ends are engaged and which cannot be reused if opened. It is applied by an APHIS representative or State representative.''
A permit would be defined as an ``official document (VS Form 1&hyph;27 or a State form which contains the same information,
but not a `permit for entry') issued by an APHIS representative, State representative, or accredited veterinarian
which lists the owner's name and address, points of origin and destination, number of animals covered, purpose of
the movement, and one of the following: The individual animal registered breed association registration tattoo,
individual animal registered breed association registration number, or similar individual identification, including
name, age, sex, breed, color, and markings.''

This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule has been determined to be not significant

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because this proposed rule would provide an alternative, the economic impact to horse owners would be minimal. The
horse owners that would be affected by this rule change are those that have horses which test positive for EIA and voluntarily
choose to transport their horses interstate to slaughter under an official seal. APHIS estimates that, annually,
between 500 and 1,000 horse operations have horses that become infected with EIA. Although it is not known how many
of these operations are ``small'' entities (less than $0.5 million in annual sales, according to Small Business Administration
size criteria), it is likely that most are in that category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current estimates put the number of horses in the United States between 6 and 10 million. In 1993, about 1 million horses
were tested for EIA. Of these, 1,859 (about 0.18 percent) tested positive for EIA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has received requests from the National Association of State
Public Health Veterinarians (NASPHV) to consider proposing a Federal restriction that animal rabies vaccines be
distributed and used only by or under the direct supervision of a licensed veterinarian. The NASPHV believes that
a uniform national restriction would result in: (1) proper handling of animal rabies vaccines to help ensure potency
and (2) improved documentation of animal rabies vaccinations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
APHIS has attempted to identify specific issues that need to be addressed prior to proposing such restrictions on
animal rabies vaccines. The Agency is seeking data and information on these issues for consideration before it decides
whether or not to proceed with such a proposal.

In 1979, APHIS published a notice of proposed action (44 FR 54737&hyph;54738, September 21, 1979) to restrict animal
rabies vaccines to distribution and use by or under the direction of a licensed veterinarian. APHIS received 150 comments
in response to that notice of proposed action. Sixty-six commenters supported the proposed action without change.
Seventy-two commenters were opposed to the proposed action. At that time, there was a lack of agreement concerning
the need and justification for a Federal restriction. The prevailing opinion of those opposed to a Federal restriction
was that there was a need for flexibility to meet local needs, especially in rural areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the comments received in 1979, the restriction that animal rabies vaccine be distributed and used by or under
the direction of a veterinarian was not imposed on a nationwide basis. Rather, APHIS determined that the decision
concerning control of distribution and use of animal rabies vaccines should be made by each State based on what would
work best for a particular State. Thus the current restriction reads in relevant part that animal rabies vaccines
are restricted ``to authorized recipients designated by proper State officials under such additional conditions
as those authorities may require'' (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 44 FR 18411, March 21, 1980).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At least 34 States currently restrict or have pending legislation to restrict the distribution and use of animal rabies
vaccines. Some sixteen States do not restrict the distribution and use of animal rabies vaccines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians (NASPHV), the American Veterinary Medical Association
(AVMA), and other organizations including State public health agencies have expressed concern regarding rabies
control programs in various States. They requested in 1989 that APHIS consider the promulgation of a Federal restriction
on the distribution and use of animal rabies vaccines on a nationwide basis to protect the health and safety of animals
and the public.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The groups that took an active role in studying the various problems associated with the control of rabies were the
NASPHV Compendium Committee, the National Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the AVMA, State and local
veterinary medical associations, veterinary medical schools, veterinary practitioners, and numerous State public
health agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NASPHV evaluated the progress of rabies control programs in the United States. As a result of its study, NASPHV
requested that the Federal Government consider strengthening current restrictions aimed toward controlling rabies
nationwide.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the request from the NASPHV to amend the Federal restriction on animal rabies vaccines to require that
they be distributed and used only by or under the direct supervision of a licensed veterinarians, APHIS requested
that the NASPHV address four issues raised by the comments to the 1979 notice of proposed action concerning restrictions
on animal rabies vaccines. Four main points were cited by commenters opposing the 1979 proposed restriction that
rabies vaccines be distributed and used only by or under the direction of a veterinarian: (1) There were inadequate
veterinary services in remote rural areas of the United States; (2) a veterinary monopoly on rabies vaccine would
raise the cost of vaccination to unaffordable amounts (especially for individuals with many animals), resulting
in fewer animals being vaccinated; (3) traveling to and from a veterinary clinic during business hours (especially
for individuals with many animals) could be very inconvenient and impractical; and (4) APHIS has no information whether
misuse of rabies vaccines by nonveterinarians is a problem.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the questions which were raised, NASPHV made the following replies. The local needs of rural areas within
the United States have changed since 1979, and the lack of adequate veterinary services in rural States is no longer
a problem. The veterinary profession stands ready to accommodate owners of multiple pets. NASPHV also indicated
that in many cases, the cost of a rabies vaccination from a veterinarian had not kept up with the rising consumer price
index. In addition, the Association stated that the inconvenience of traveling to and from a veterinary clinic during
business hours for rabies vaccinations was no different than the inconvenience of pet ownership in general, and that
improper vaccination by nonveterinarians was worse than no vaccination at all because such vaccination gave a false
sense of security.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NASPHV argued that proper handling of animal rabies vaccines, including cold storage, physical examination
of the animal receiving vaccine to ensure the health status of the animal, proper timing and route of administration
according to label instructions, and knowledge of rabies control were essential for effective rabies vaccination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NASPHV further argued that in a mobile society such as the United States, it was unfair and unsafe for the public
to rely on so many different State rabies laws and regulations to protect the public. The restriction of rabies vaccines
at the Federal level would reduce confusion, unnecessary revaccination, and the necessity for human post-exposure
treatment. Further, as endemic reservoirs of wildlife rabies continue to spread and put more areas of the United States
at risk, the standardization of rabies control becomes more important. The Association concluded that the need for
proper administration and improved documentation of animal rabies vaccinations are the most important issues concerning
national rabies prevention in man and animals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A case arose in 1986, in which a rabies vaccine manufacturer needed to follow documentation of rabies vaccinations
in order to trace recipients of its vaccine after a change had been made in the instructions for administration. Since
the particular manufacturer's vaccine was sold to and administered by veterinarians or State authorized recipients,
in large part, the appropriate records were available for the tracking and revaccination of thousands of animals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public health officials have expressed concern regarding the uncertainties of vaccine administration and certification
when animals are vaccinated by nonveterinarians or without adequate veterinary supervision. There is reason to
believe that some distributors, in States without restrictions on vaccine sale or administration, are distributing
rabies vaccines to unauthorized individuals in other States that currently have such restrictions. This practice
destroys the effectiveness of State programs designed to monitor and verify vaccine sale and administration in such
States and is contrary to their law. Such practice also creates significant safety concerns since any failure associated
with vaccine administration and documentation increases the risk of rabies exposure to both animals and man.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dogs and cats that have properly documented rabies vaccinations and that are involved in bite cases involving a human
being are isolated and observed for 10 days at a veterinary quarantine facility to confirm the absence of rabies. When
the vaccination record of a dog or cat that has bitten someone cannot be verified, the animal may be euthanized to determine
if rabies virus is present in brain tissue. In these cases, the individual who has been bitten and the physician are
placed in the position of weighing the risks and costs of post-exposure prophylactic treatment against the odds of
having been exposed to rabies. Because the verification of animal rabies vaccination is important in decisions relating
to both animals and man, the Association argued that the issue of proper documentation of vaccination is a major concern.
The fact that 618 cases of rabies among domestic animals in the United States (including 155 dogs and 189 cats) were
reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 1991 makes an informed choice important. Because of
questions concerning proper vaccine handling, storage, administration, documentation of vaccination and revaccination,
and recordkeeping, many State public health departments disregard rabies vaccination claims by owners and only
rely on documentation from a veterinarian as proof of vaccination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reviewing NASPHV's request to amend the Federal restriction on the distribution and use of animal rabies vaccines,
APHIS has determined that it needs additional information to determine the appropriate course of action with respect
to this matter. Before proceeding with a proposal to amend the Federal restriction on animal rabies vaccines, the
Agency must determine whether such an amendment would in fact be beneficial, whether rabies control programs and
rabies vaccination could not be better managed by the States and local jurisdictions, and whether the benefit of Federal
control would outweigh the cost of such a program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It could be argued that the anticipated benefits from amending the Federal restriction on animal rabies vaccines
to require that they be distributed and used only by or under the direct supervision of a licensed veterinarian would
be: (1) more uniform regulation of the distribution and administration of animal rabies vaccines, (2) improved documentation
of animal rabies vaccinations to enable public health officials to make an informed choice concerning the therapy
for animal bite victims; (3) facilitation of the recall of any unsatisfactory serials of rabies vaccines, and (4)
assurance of the identification of animals receiving vaccines determined not to meet requirements for stability
or potency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, it is reported that 98.4 percent of the 25,000,000 doses of animal rabies vaccine that are distributed
in the United States each year are sold directly to veterinarians. It is not known, however, how many of these doses
are redistributed through catalogs and over the counter for administration by 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
nonveterinarians.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An estimated 9,000 human beings are treated annually in the United States for potential exposure to rabid dogs and
cats. Post-exposure human rabies prophylaxis costs an estimated $1,000 per patient. In 1989, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention recommended that the most effective methods for reducing human exposure to rabies are education
of the public to avoid unfamiliar, especially wild animals, and vaccination of pet dogs and cats.

Request for Comments

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since receiving the request from the NASPHV to amend the Federal restrictions on animal rabies vaccines, APHIS has
attempted to identify specific issues (enumerated below) that need to be addressed before the Agency can proceed
with a notice of proposed rulemaking. Some of these issues raise questions and identify competing interests that
are difficult to resolve. For example, a Federal restriction that animal rabies vaccines only be distributed to veterinarians
and administered by or under the direct supervision of a licensed veterinarian could have the benefit of ensuring
proper administration and could also enable public health officials to certify that a rabies vaccine was properly
administered. An unintended effect of such a restriction, however, could be a reduction in the number of animals vaccinated
with a corresponding reduction in the effectiveness of rabies prevention by making it more expensive or impractical
to vaccinate multiple animals in single households, animals in kennels, farm animals, or animals in metropolitan
animal shelters_animals which are often vaccinated by nonveterinarians. With regard to the issue of proper vaccine
administration, a 1989 study showed that only 5% of rabid cats and 14% of rabid dogs reported that year had been vaccinated
against rabies, suggesting that rabies incidence in dogs and cats is related more to the failure to vaccinate than
the failure of vaccination. After considering the various factors involved in rabies control, APHIS believes that
any amended Federal restriction that the Agency may promulgate should encourage the vaccination of pets while providing
the greatest benefit/cost value. Towards this end, the Agency seeks input on alternative approaches to the control
of animal rabies vaccines. The experience of States that have enacted their own State restrictions is sought on these
issues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public comment is requested to assist APHIS in its evaluation of the benefits and costs of a Federal restriction providing
that animal rabies vaccines be distributed and used only by or under the direct supervision of a licensed veterinarian.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to obtain a better understanding of the benefits versus the costs of such a Federal restriction, specific
comments, projections, or data are requested on the following issues:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The rate of vaccine misuse and failure when vaccine is administered by nonveterinarians versus veterinarians;

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. the projected cost versus benefits (e.g. decreased incidence of animal rabies, better recordkeeping, or fewer
human rabies prophylaxes being sought) of a regulatory requirement that animal rabies vaccines be distributed and
used only by or under the direct supervision of a licensed veterinarian, based on the experience of States that have
passed such legislation;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. the number of persons seeking post-exposure rabies prophylaxis in situations in which a current animal vaccination
could not be confirmed by a veterinarian;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. information indicating that 98.4 percent of the 25,000,000 doses of animal rabies vaccines that are distributed
in the United States each year are sold directly to licensed veterinarians only;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. the number of doses, if any, of animal rabies vaccine that are distributed or sold to nonveterinarians for administration
by nonveterinarians that are not under the supervision of a veterinarian;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. the impact of a Federal restriction concerning the distribution and use of animal rabies vaccines by or under the
direct supervision of a licensed veterinarian on metropolitan animal shelters and other organizations that currently
vaccinate their own animals;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. the availability of low-cost rabies clinics nationwide and particularly in rural areas to accommodate those individuals
who currently vaccinate their own animals because of cost;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. the effect, if any, of such a Federal rabies restriction on animal rabies vaccines on the number of animals that are
vaccinated based on the experience of States that have passed such restrictions; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. the impact, if any, on the number of companion animals versus farm animals that are vaccinated, of such a Federal
restriction on animal rabies vaccines; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. less restrictive, alternative approaches to animal rabies control such as a Federal requirement that distribution
of animal rabies vaccines be restricted to licensed veterinarians only; or that distribution and use of animal rabies
vaccines be by or under the direction of a licensed veterinarian only, or other options.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Factual data supported by verifiable sources (published reports in peer-reviewed journals, university-sponsored
studies, objective scientific data, etc.) will be given greater weight by the Agency than anecdotal information
in arriving at its decision whether or not to proceed with a proposed rulemaking. Any projections provided to APHIS
should indicate data sources and the assumptions made in reaching whatever conclusions obtained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For those questions for which data are not available, APHIS also requests comments on the most cost-effective means
to obtain such data.

This notice proposes to establishes Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface within a 6.3
mile radius of the Lewis County Regional airport, Monticello, MO. A standard instrument approach procedure (SIAP)
has been recently developed at Lewis County Regional Airport, utilizing the Quincy, MO. VHF Omnidirectional Range/Distance
Measuring Equipment (VORTAC) as a navigational aid. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class
E airspace for instrument flight rules (IFR) operators executing the recently established SIAP.

The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class
E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Monticello, MO. A SIAP based on the Quincy VORTAC has
been established. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class E airspace for IFR operators executing
the VOR/DME SIAP at Lewis County Regional Airport. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American
Datum 83. Class E airspace areas extend upward from 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth are published in Paragraph
6005 of FAA Order 7400.9B, dated July 18, 1994 and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference
in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document would be published
subsequently in the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Securities and Exchange Commission proposes a rule setting standards for market makers in handling customer
limit orders in NASDAQ National Market System securities. The rule would prohibit a market maker from trading for
its own account, directly, or indirectly, at a price at which the market maker could execute a customer limit order
it is holding, without executing the customer's limit order at the limit price or a price more favorable to the customer
under the specific terms and conditions by which the order is accepted by the market maker.

I. Introduction and Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') today is proposing a rule (17 CFR 240.15c5&hyph;1)
to prohibit market makers in NASDAQ National Market System (``NASDAQ/NMS'') securities from trading ahead of customer
orders that they are holding at the same or better price. The Commission is proposing to change existing practices
because it believes this will enhance broker-dealer competition, promote efficient pricing of securities, facilitate
best execution of customer orders and better reflect investor expectations in the NASDAQ/NMS market. The growth
of the NASDAQ market and the concomitant visibility of and investor interest in its companies has changed investors'
expectations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In designing the proposed rule, the Commission has been mindful of the special role of NASDAQ market makers in discovering
prices and providing liquidity in NASDAQ/NMS stocks. The proposal seeks comment on specific trading standards that
would govern individual market makers. The proposed rule is intended to have the effect of giving priority to orders
that improve the market (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, narrow the bid-ask spread) being made by a specific market maker. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generally, an order to buy or sell a security at a specified price (``limit order'') is first received by the customer's
broker, who either routes the order to an affiliated or non-affiliated market maker for execution or, if the firm is
itself a market maker in the security, to the firm's market making desk. The combination of limit order execution and
market maker functions can lead to the market maker competing with a customer for executions. While the past few years
have seen several positive efforts at improving limit order handling practices in the NASDAQ market, the Commission
believes that it should consider a limit order priority rule to ensure protection for all customer orders in this market.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The priority accorded a customer limit order today is different depending on the structure of the marketplace of execution.
The rules of national securities exchanges generally require specialists and other market professionals to yield
to a customer's limit order; the specialist cannot trade for its own account at prices equal to or better than the limit
order until the limit order is executed.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers (``NASD'') similarly prohibit third market makers (over-the-counter
market makers in listed securities) from trading ahead of customer limit orders in the third market.

See, e.g., New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') Rule 92, 2 NYSE Guide (CCH) &para;2092. The priority rules of the New
York Stock Exchange do permit an exception to this general principle for pre-arranged crosses of 25,000 shares or
more. Such a cross may be executed on the floor without interacting with pre-existing limit orders at the same price.
A preexisting limit order, however, may interact with the buyer or seller in the cross if it provides a price that is
better than the proposed cross price.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1988, the Commission addressed the issue of customer limit order protection in the NASDAQ market.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the Manning decision, the Commission affirmed, based on principles of agency law, an NASD determination that it
is inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade for a market maker to trade ahead of a customer limit order
unless the customer is first informed of the firm's limit order policy. As a result of the Manning decision, the NASD
filed a proposed rule change with the Commission stating that a member firm will not be deemed to have violated NASD
Rules of Fair Practice if it provides customers with a statement setting forth the circumstances in which the member
firm accepts limit orders and the policies and procedures that the firm follows in handling these orders.

Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26824 (May 15, 1989), 54 FR 22046 (May 22, 1989). The proposal included model disclosure

 The NASD solicited member comment on eliminating the disclosure ``safe-harbor'' approach for members trading ahead
of customer limit orders and the effect a rule prohibiting trading ahead might have on integrated broker-dealers,
on limit orders received from other firms, and on market liquidity.

The Commission approved the NASD Interpretation on June 29, 1994, but expressed concern that the prohibition did
not extend to trading ahead of limit orders of other firms' customers that have been sent to the market maker for execution.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 The NASD also convened a special task force to study the potential effect of expanded limit order protection on market
liquidity and market maker capital commitment and to report back to the Board in September. The Commission stated
that while such a study could be helpful to a future consideration of this issue, the Commission believed that member-to-member
trades raise significant concerns that should be addressed and, if necessary, the Commission would consider instituting
its own rulemaking proceeding for that purpose.

The task force has now submitted its report to the NASD Board of Directors and the Board has proposed for member comment
market maker standards that would restrict market makers from trading ahead of certain member-to-member trades,
keyed in part on the size of the customer limit order.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under the NASD proposal, market makers would be prohibited from trading at prices equal to or better than the price
of a customer limit order they hold if the size of that order was 1,000 shares or less and from trading at prices better
than a customer's limit order if the size of that order was greater than 1,000 shares.

The Commission believes that the NASD's proposal is an instructive step and will provide useful comment from the member
firm community. The Commission, however, believes that comment from the broader constituency of the investing public
and other non-NASD members will be critical in formulating adequate limit order protection for the NASDAQ market.
In addition, the Commission believes that alternatives which provide more extensive limit order protection for
public customers also should be the subject of public comment. Therefore, the Commission has determined to propose
its own rule. Publication of the proposal will complement the efforts of the NASD and enable the Commission to act on
its own initiative if it deems such action appropriate.

The legislative history of the Securities Acts Amendments of 1975, under which Section 15(c)(5) was adopted, endorsed
priority for customer limit orders in national market system securities and stated that the Commission should have
discretion to achieve this protection. Congress noted that for suitable securities, every effort should be made
to ensure that public investors in these securities would receive the benefits and protections that would result
from the placing of public orders ahead of dealers' orders in determining the sequence in which orders entering the
market are executed.

In its order approving the recent NASD Interpretation, the Commission indicated that a further Commission rule might
be necessary to ensure protection for all public limit orders in NASDAQ/NMS securities, should the NASD fail to do
so. The NASD's Interpretation prevents a market maker from trading ahead of its own customers' limit orders, but does
not prevent the same market maker from trading ahead of the limit orders of other firms' customers that are sent to the
market maker for execution.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission believes that it is reasonable for customers to expect that the quality of the execution received will
not vary from trade to trade. Under current NASD rules, the quality of the execution received could vary depending
on whether the customer's firm or an affiliate makes a market in a security or whether that firm sends the order to another
market maker for execution. Customers choose their brokers for a variety of reasons, including cost and integrity;
whether the broker also makes a market in a security in which the customer may be interested should not affect the quality
of the execution.

The Commission believes that the principles of investor protection and market integrity would be advanced by a limit

By providing a customer's limit order priority over the market maker's proprietary trading, more trade volume will
be available to be matched with the customer's order, resulting in quicker and more frequent executions for limit
order customers. In the past, customers may have refrained from placing limit orders because of the uncertainty of
and difficulty in obtaining an execution at a price between the spread. A customer limit order rule will encourage
dealers that accept customer limit orders to execute them in a timely fashion so that they may resume their proprietary
trading activities. With the improvement in the quality of these executions, investors will have greater confidence
in this market and trade volume from retail investors could increase.

In addition, customer limit order priority would improve the price discovery process in NASDAQ/NMS securities.
Limit orders aid price discovery by adding liquidity to the market and by tightening the effective spread between
the bid and ask price of a security, even though these limit orders would not be displayed in the market maker's quote.
The practice of not executing a limit order until the inside quotation price reaches the customer's limit order price
also impedes the price discovery process by preventing those orders from interacting with other orders. More expeditious
handling of customer limit orders under the proposed rule could provide investors with a more accurate indication
of the buy and sell interest at a given moment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
One of the problems with not giving customer limit orders priority is the cost to public customers in terms of inferior
or missed executions for limit orders. It is currently impossible for customers to monitor these costs. The ability
of a customer to monitor the cost of the transaction and choose a broker-dealer on that basis imposes a competitive
discipline on the market maker to achieve the best possible execution for the customer or risk losing the business.
Unlike institutional clients who are in a better position to negotiate their own protection with market makers, public
customers have less viable alternatives in determining where their orders are ultimately sent for execution. Under
these circumstances, market makers lack the same incentive to provide superior executions to public customers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Market makers who oppose a comprehensive rule mandating limit order priority for customers do so in part on the ground
that such a rule would reduce their return from market making.

 Market makers are, of course, entitled to earn a profit from their service; A limit order rule could force market makers
to recoup the cost of the transaction in ways more apparent to the customer, such as by charging a commission for handling
the limit order. The Commission requests comment in the form of specific data regarding the potential consequences
of the proposed rule for market liquidity and market maker capital commitment.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Limit order protection in the NASDAQ market is now required only of firms that execute their own customers' limit orders.
Market makers still may trade ahead of the limit orders entered by customers of other firms that are sent to them for
execution. Proposed Rule 15c5&hyph;1 would provide limit order protection to all customers in NASDAQ/NMS securities,
regardless of where the order is ultimately sent for execution.

A. General Prohibition on Trading Ahead 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (a) of the proposed rule establishes the general prohibition on trading ahead of limit orders: a market
maker shall not effect a transaction involving a covered security for its own account, directly or indirectly, at
a price at which the market maker could execute a customer limit order it is holding without executing the customer
limit order at the limit price or a price more favorable to the customer, under the specific terms and conditions by
which the order was accepted by the market maker. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule applies once a market maker has accepted a customer limit order for execution.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
25
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The rule applies to all market makers, whether they are handling orders for their firm's clients or orders sent from
another firm. Finally, the rule applies to all accounts of the market maker in which the market maker or any person associated
with the market maker is directly or indirectly interested.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a customer limit order to buy 1,000 shares of stock at $201/4. Firm 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
B,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a market maker in that security, is quoting a bid of $20 and an offer of $201/2. Under the proposed rule, a purchase of
a certain number of shares by firm 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at $201/4 or lower would trigger an obligation to fill the same number of shares in the customer's order at $201/4. A
failure to execute the customer's limit order either before or immediately after the market maker's purchase would
constitute a violation of the rule. The Commission is requesting comment on whether it should exclude from the protection
of the rule limit orders to buy at the bid or limit orders to sell at the offer.

C. Definition of ``Customer Limit Order'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (c)(3) of the proposed rule defines the term ``limit order'' as an order to buy or sell shares of a security
at a specified price or other price more favorable to the customer. In the example above, the customer placed a limit
order to buy 1,000 shares of stock at $201/4, indicating that the customer wishes to pay no more than $20.25 for the security.
The market maker may fill the order at a lower price, but not at a price higher than the limit the customer has set. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission proposes to limit the class of persons who would be protected by the rule to public customers only. To
this end, the term ``customer'' in paragraph (c)(3) is defined as a person who is not a registered broker or dealer.
Nevertheless, because customer limit orders often are sent to a market maker by a broker or another market maker that
originally received the order, the definition of ``customer'' would encompass such orders as customer orders entitled
to protection under the rule. Orders for registered brokers or dealers that are sent to a market maker by another broker
or market maker would not be entitled to this protection. The Commission requests comment on the necessity of restricting
limit order protection to customers and the effectiveness of the definition in carrying out that purpose.

D. ``Terms and Conditions'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While the proposed rule does not distinguish institutional from retail orders, the Commission believes that larger-sized
orders may qualify for special treatment. The language of the proposed rule that would allow the parties to set the
specific terms and conditions for acceptance of limit orders is intended to permit market makers to employ the appropriate
strategy in filling a larger sized order without being subjected to the requirements of the proposed ban. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By distinguishing the protection afforded a limit order by its size or dollar value, the rule would recognize the greater
significance of larger size orders to market makers seeking to establish or liquidate a position and the ability of
larger sized customers to negotiate specific order handling procedures. Market makers actively compete for customer
order flow. A customer dealing in greater size or amount generally can better monitor the market for the security and
negotiate alternative execution procedures with another market maker.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5,000 or 10,000 shares, and/or a dollar value limit,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
$50,000, $100,000 or $200,000, that would determine market maker obligations with respect to these two types of orders
in the final rule. This will insure that the rule ultimately adopted includes limit order protection for retail investors
while maintaining the ability of market makers to negotiate order handling arrangements with their institutional
clients.

The rule proposal also establishes exceptions for all-or-none and odd-lot orders as well as a general exemptive provision
[paragraph (d)]. The specific exceptions to the rule [paragraph (b)] are discussed below. The Commission requests

Exception for All-or-None Orders 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule includes an exception for all-or-none customer limit orders [paragraph (b)(2)]. An all-or-none
customer limit order is defined in paragraph (c)(1) as one that carries a condition that instructs the market maker
to execute all of the shares in the order only if it can be done all at once. The purpose of this exception is to prevent
delays in executing other orders that a market maker may be receiving at the time the market maker is handling the all-or-none
order. In the example above, the customer's limit order for 1,000 shares of stock could be filled in several separate
transactions. With an all-or-none order, a market maker must execute all the shares of the order in a single trade.
The market maker may not have immediate access to that number of shares. In the meantime, other orders may be received
that require the market maker to purchase shares from other market makers or their customers. Without this exception,
the market maker would not be able to buy any stock at less than the all-or-none limit order price and, ultimately, the
execution quality of other customer orders would suffer. Thus, using the above example, the exception would permit
a market maker handling an all-or-none order to purchase shares in the security for its own account at $20 1/4 or lower
without filling the customer's limit order, but only for amounts smaller than the 1,000 shares in the all-or-none
order. The market maker could not, however, purchase 1,000 shares or more at $20 1/4 or lower for its own account without
satisfying the customer limit order.

IV. Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has prepared an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (``IRFA'') in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 603
regarding proposed Rule 15c5&hyph;1. The IRFA uses certain definitions of small entities adopted by the Commission
for purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The IRFA indicates that regulatory action is required in order to
ensure that market makers in NASDAQ/NMS securities adhere to certain minimum standards of fair treatment of customers.
Specifically, by prohibiting a market maker from trading ahead of a customer limit order that it holds, the rule would
improve the quality of executions for customers and the price discovery process in the market for these securities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1993, there were 492 active NASDAQ market makers.
<FOOTCITE>30</FOOTCITE>
 Data on the number of market makers meeting the definition of small entity that make markets in NASDAQ/NMS securities
and execute customer limit orders is unavailable. The Commission is unable to quantify reasonably the impact that
the proposed rule would have on small market makers or small issuers. The Commission does not believe it would be practicable
to exempt small market makers from the proposed rule because to do so would be inconsistent with the Commission's statutory
mandate to protect investors.

V. Effects on Competition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act
<FOOTCITE>31</FOOTCITE>
 requires the Commission, in adopting rules under the Act, to consider any anti-competitive effects of such rules
and to balance these effects against the regulatory benefits gained in furthering the purposes of the Act. As previously
noted, comment letters received prior to the adoption of the NASD Interpretation suggested that such a rule would
deny market makers an opportunity to earn a profit in some situations. If true, this may result in less market maker
commitment in the NASDAQ/NMS market which may in turn effect competition in this market. The Commission is soliciting
comment on the effect the rule may have on market maker capital commitment and small issuers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission preliminarily views Rule 15c5&hyph;1 as causing no burden on competition unnecessary or inappropriate
in furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act. The Commission believes that the principles of customer protection
that Congress envisioned and that would be advanced by this rule justify the burdens that the rule will impose on market
makers. The Commission, however, requests comment on any competitive burdens that might result from adoption of
the proposed rule described in this release.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule requires all housing agencies (HAs) to submit certain data electronically to HUD in a HUD prescribed
format. For HAs that are not already automated or who determine that automation is not cost-effective, transmission
of the data through the use of a service bureau is permitted. Electronic transmission is necessary because the manual
submission of HUD forms has become a burden to HAs and HUD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule applies to projects administered under the public housing, Indian housing, and Section 8 Rental
Certificate, Rental Voucher, and Moderate Rehabilitation programs. A similar rule, 24 CFR part 208, was issued with
respect to multifamily subsidized projects administered under programs subject to the oversight of the Assistant
Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner.

I. Paperwork Burden 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The information collection requirements contained in this proposed rule have been submitted to the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) for review under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501&hyph;3520). The submission
amends the current requirements approved by OMB on January 26, 1994 (Number: 2577&hyph;0083). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public reporting burden for the collection of information requirements contained in this proposed rule is estimated
to include the time for reviewing the instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining
the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Information on the estimated public
reporting burden is provided under the Preamble heading,

A. Impetus for Change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Housing agencies have been submitting to HUD data forms for each family assisted under the public housing, Indian
housing, and Section 8 Rental Certificate, Rental Voucher and Moderate Rehabilitation Programs. The Forms HUD&hyph;50058,
Family Report, and HUD&hyph;50058&hyph;FSS, Family Self-Sufficiency Addendum, concern family characteristics,
rent, income, subsidy payments and participation in the Family Self-Sufficiency Program.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As of March 1, 1994, these forms were being processed by the Department's central processing facility. Approximately
85 percent of reporting agencies (3,655 HAs) are submitting paper forms. This extensive processing of paper forms
has become a burden to the HAs as well as to HUD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To reduce the cost to the Department of processing this information and to improve its accuracy, the Department is
issuing this proposed rule to require that the information be submitted electronically. The change is expected to
contribute significant savings to the Department, in a time when budget contraints demand such savings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Housing agencies that report on paper have the time consuming task of completing the calculations which are prone
to error. The Department edits the information on the forms. When errors are found, HAs are notified (by letter) and
requested to make appropriate corrections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The time spent by HAs in initiating electronic transmission and making corrections to the electronic data submissions
will be offset by future savings in the reexamination and reporting process, as well as increased accuracy and speed
associated with the admission, reexamination and reporting processes, and the reduced number of HUD adjustments
and paperwork required by these adjustments. This change to electronic submission of family data will also encourage
HAs to automate other functions or to automate this particular function as they automate others, in the course of revising
their own management practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule will require HAs to submit data electronically via telephone modem, rather than through tape, diskette,
or paper. However, the rule also provides that the Department may approve transmission of the data by tape or diskette
where the Department determines that the cost of telephonic transmission would be excessive. (It is contemplated
that this would only occur in a few instances, involving very large HAs.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Voluntary Automation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several years ago, the Department began to develop a computer system to collect all rental assistance data and ensure
the accuracy of subsidy payments. This system serves as the basis for the Department's electronic data transmission
requirements in lieu of hard copy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In July 1993, the Department distributed a Form HUD&hyph;50058 Information Packet, which gave instructions for
submitting the data electronically. The Department encouraged program participants to begin transmitting data
electronically to HUD (via tape, diskette, or telephonic network). Approximately 600 housing agencies have responded
by submitting the data electronically. Recently, the Department initiated a pilot test with 20 HAs using the telephonic
network mode (via SprintMail_a commercial software package) to evaluate HA capability for data transmission. In
addition, a test program (for use by all HAs) has been initiated to assure that errors are not introduced by the sender's
software. Both processes will facilitate implementation of this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These electronic transmissions consist of information requested on the forms, organized into various categories
and transmitted in an ASCII fixed format (not field delimited). These fixed format ASCII files will deliver the data
with the field lengths as specified by HUD in the July 1993 guide. (This guide may be obtained from the office listed
above for program information.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department encourages HAs to begin electronic transmission as soon as the capability exists. An earlier electronic
transmission will allow timely correction of errors found during the data load into the automated software. These
corrections will then reduce the number of errors formerly found when manual information entered the Department's
system. Early electronic transmission will also help minimize an initial surge of data in the system from the number
of currently nonautomated HAs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Action Required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Nonautomated HAs (i.e. those who currently prepare the Forms HUD&hyph;50058 and HUD&hyph;50058&hyph;FSS manually)
should immediately begin to obtain information on the cost of purchasing hardware or software, or both, to determine
whether it is financially feasible to purchase these items or whether they should contract out the electronic transmission
of data to another entity. These HAs must: (1) Complete the search and either purchase the necessary hardware and software,
or sign service contracts, (2) complete their data loading, and (3) begin electronic transmission by one year after
the publication of the final rule.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While the Department would prefer each HA to obtain its own hardware and software, HAs may elect to contract out the
electronic transmission function. However, when HAs contract out the electronic transmission function, they are
still required to continue to retain the ability to monitor the day-to-day operations of the projects and be able to
demonstrate that ability to their local HUD Office. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In recognition of the difficulty some HAs may have in conversion to electronic submission of data, the rule will permit
HUD Field Offices to grant extensions of time beyond the stated implementation date for commencement of electronic
submission under certain circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Housing agencies may be concerned about funding the initial cost of automation. For public and Indian housing, the
costs of the electronic transmission of the correctly formatted data, including either the purchase and maintenance
of computer hardware or software, or both; the cost of contracting for those services; or the cost of centralizing
the electronic transmission function; are eligible operating expenses and can be included in the operating budget.
However, they are not eligible for additional operating subsidy funding. Automating this management function also
is an allowable expense under the Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program and the Comprehensive Grant Program.
For Section 8 programs, the costs may be paid from ongoing administrative fees or the Section 8 operating reserve.
Ultimately, the cost of automating this function will be recovered in reduced administrative costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department anticipates that the large number of vendors competing in the marketplace will cause the cost of automation
and electronic transmission to be reasonable, and a large number of HAs will therefore be able to purchase and maintain
their own equipment. However, the decision to purchase and maintain the necessary equipment and services or to contract
for the automation and electronic transmission function, will only be made by each housing agency.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Parts Amended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule would add a new part 908 to specify the electronic submission requirements. The requirements for
obtaining and verifying family income information in the various programs are found in &sect;813.109 for the Section
8 Rental Certificate, Rental Voucher and Moderate Rehabilitation programs, in &sect;905.315 for the Indian housing
program, and in &sect;913.109 for the public housing program. This rule would add a new paragraph to each of these sections
to cross reference the requirements of the new part 908. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Other Matters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Environmental Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with 40 CFR 1508.4 of the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality and 24 CFR 50.20(o) of the
HUD regulations, the policies and procedures contained in this proposed rule relate only to HUD administrative procedures
and, therefore, are categorically excluded from the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Federalism Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this proposed rule will not have substantial direct effects on states or their political
subdivisions, or the relationship between the Federal government and the states, or on the distribution of power
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibilities among the various levels of government. Specifically, this proposed rule is directed to housing
agencies that operate HUD-assisted housing, whose functions and authority remain unchanged. It merely changes
the format of data submitted to HUD to make its transmission more accurate and efficient. It will not impinge upon the
relationship between the Federal Government and State and local governments. As a result, the proposed rule is not
subject to review under the order.

C. Impact on the Family 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Family,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 has determined that this proposed rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance,
and general well-being, and, thus, is not subject to review under the order. No significant change in existing HUD
policies or programs will result from promulgation of this proposed rule, as those policies and programs relate to
family concerns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)) has reviewed and approved this
proposed rule, and in so doing certifies that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Because this proposed rule changes the way in which the data is transmitted to HUD, and all
costs associated with implementation of the electronic transmission will be considered allowable project operating
costs, the proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Regulatory Agenda

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule was not listed in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on April 25, 1994
(59 FR 20424) under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and therefore was submitted to the Committee
on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House
of Representatives under section 7(o) of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this part is to require Housing Agencies (HAs) that operate public housing, Indian housing, or Section
8 Rental Certificate, Rental Voucher and Moderate Rehabilitation programs to electronically submit certain data
to HUD for those programs. This electronically submitted data is required for HUD Forms HUD&hyph;50058, Family Report,

Automated HAs. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Housing agencies that currently use automated software packages to transmit Forms HUD&hyph;50058 and HUD&hyph;50058&hyph;FSS
information by tape or diskette to the Department's data processing contractor must convert to telephonic electronic
transmission of that data in a HUD specified format by

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Housing agencies that currently prepare and transmit the HUD&hyph;50058 and HUD&hyph;50058&hyph;FSS information
to HUD paper must: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Complete a vendor search and obtain either: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The necessary hardware and software required to develop and maintain an in-house automated data processing system
(ADP) used to generate electronic submission of the data for these forms via telephonic network; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A service contract for the operation of an automated system to generate electronic submission of the data for
these forms via telephonic network; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Complete their data loading; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Begin electronic transmission by

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Electronic transmission of data. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Electronic transmission of data consists of submission of all required data fields (correctly formatted) from the
forms HUD&hyph;050058 and HUD&hyph;50058&hyph;FSS telephonically, in accordance with HUD instructions. Regardless
of whether an HA obtains the ADP system itself or contracts with a service bureau to provide the system, the software
must be periodically updated to incorporate changes or revisions in legislation, regulations, handbooks, notices,
or HUD electronic transmission data format requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Service contract. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HAs that determine that the purchase of hardware and/or software is not cost effective may contract out the electronic
data transmission function to organizations that provide such services, including, but not limited to the following
organizations: local management associations and management agents with centralized facilities. HAs that contract
out the electronic transmission function must retain the ability to monitor the day-to-day operations of the project
at the HA site and be able to demonstrate the ability to the relevant HUD Field Office. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the Department may approve transmission
of the data by tape or diskette if it determines that the cost of telephonic transmission would be excessive.

Revenue Code. The securities are characterized in the regulations as time deposit, demand deposit, and special zero
interest.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule is a revision of existing regulations codified at 31 CFR part 344, published on July 7, 1989, at 54
FR 28752, with technical corrections published July 7, 1993, at 58 FR 31908. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1992, the Bureau of the Public Debt established the Division of Special Investments at its offices in Parkersburg,
West Virginia (WV). The primary mission of the Division of Special Investments has been to provide policy guidance
and direction for the State and Local Government Series securities program. The Division has reviewed the current
processing environment and is implementing operational and regulatory changes which are expected to benefit investors
in United States Treasury securities of the State and Local Government Series by providing streamlined procedures,
a centralized processing facility, and improved customer services.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the current processing environment for State and Local Government Series securities, the Bureau of the Public
Debt has authorized selected Federal Reserve Banks or Branches, acting as fiscal agents of the United States, to provide
services in connection with the purchase of, transactions involving, and redemption of, the securities. Subscriptions
for the purchase of State and Local Government Series securities are accepted at designated Federal Reserve Banks
or Branches, subject to verification by the Bureau of the Public Debt. Full payment for each subscription must be available
in an account for debit by the Federal Reserve Bank or Branch on or before the date of issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current processing environment requires that staffing and technical expertise be maintained at 12 designated
Federal Reserve Banks or Branches to provide unique services in connection with State and Local Government Series
securities. The Bureau of the Public Debt, Office of Securities and Accounting Services, Division of Special Investments
(hereafter referred to as the Division of Special Investments) has determined that the volume of transactions in
this securities program does not merit the expense of maintaining technical expertise at 12 different locations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bureau of the Public Debt has decided to centralize all issuance, funds collection, and accounting functions
for the State and Local Government Series securities program in the Division of Special Investments. The responsibility
for these functions will be withdrawn from the designated Federal Reserve Banks beginning on a specific issue date
which will be announced in the final rule. It is anticipated that this date will be January 3, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After centralization, Federal Reserve Bank or Branch involvement in this program will be limited to processing interest
and redemption payments made through reserve account credits for a very small number of existing securities accounts.
This method of payment is limited to securities for which subscriptions were submitted prior to February 1, 1987.
More than 98% of all interest and redemption payments for State and Local Government Series securities are made by
the Automated Clearing House method (ACH), with credit directed to the owner's account at a financial institution.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Beginning on the effective date of the final rule, subscriptions for the purchase of State and Local Government Series
securities which request issuance on or after a designated date will only be accepted by the Division of Special Investments.
Full payment for each subscription will be submitted by the investor's financial institution on or before the issue
date utilizing the Fedwire funds transfer system which is available throughout the commercial banking industry.
It will no longer be necessary for investors to deposit the funds in an account subject to debit by a Federal Reserve
Bank or Branch on or before the date of issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule change is expected to provide investors in State and Local Government Series securities with several
benefits. Investors will enjoy a higher level of customer service and more consistent application of the regulations
pertaining to this securities program. Investors will be dealing directly with staff in the Division of Special Investments
who are trained and skilled in the many unique aspects of this securities program and whose principal responsibility
it is to manage the State and Local Government Series securities program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, United States taxpayers will benefit in terms of the reduced costs of operating this securities program
which will be realized by centralizing operations within the Division of Special Investments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the responsibility for all issuance, funds collection, and accounting functions for the State and Local
Government Series securities program will be withdrawn from the designated Federal Reserve Banks and because the
Division of Special Investments must assume these operations on or about January 3, 1995, the Bureau of the Public
Debt has determined that a comment period of 15 days is necessary. This will allow time for comments to be incorporated
in a final rule within operational time constraints. Although most of the changes in this proposed rule are ministerial
in nature (for example, changes to increase the use of facsimile transmittals and to provide new addresses), proposed
changes concerning amending subscriptions (&sect;344.3(b)(3)(iv) and &sect;344.7(b)) and concerning waivers
and fees associated with the failure to settle subscriptions (&sect;344.4(b) and &sect;344.8(b)) merit special
attention. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of the Treasury is also in the process of considering the revision of the regulations governing the
State and Local Government Series securities program, with a view to increasing the flexibility of the program. The
proposed rule does not include these types of changes due to the need to adopt the proposed rule very quickly. Changes
to the State and Local Government Series securities program could include changes in the certification requirements
and in the rules relating to the redemption of SLGS securities before maturity.

Time deposit Treasury securities are offered to State and local government investors to enable these investors to
satisfy yield restrictions prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code and regulations. Changes from the 1989 regulations
are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Section 344.2(b)_This section would delete reference to the Federal Reserve Banks as a receiving point for initial
subscriptions to reflect the consolidation of program administration in Parkersburg, WV, and would expressly allow
for sending of initial subscriptions by facsimile equipment (FAX) or other carriers, in addition to postal delivery.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Section 344.2(c)(2)_This section would clarify the authority governing Automated Clearing House payments
on account of United States securities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Section 344.2(c)(2)(iii)_This section would clarify that fiscal agency checks, rather than Treasury checks,
are an alternative payment mechanism for securities for which subscriptions were submitted prior to February 1,
1987. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Section 344.3(a)_This section would delete reference to the Federal Reserve Banks as the receiving point for
subscriptions for purchase of securities under this offering, as well as the reference to in person delivery to such
Banks, to reflect the consolidation of program administration in Parkersburg, WV. In addition, this section would
expressly allow for sending of initial subscriptions by facsimile equipment. Whether subscriptions are sent by
FAX, mail or other carrier, subscribers are encouraged to expedite delivery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Section 344.3(b)(1)_This section would permit sending of initial subscriptions by facsimile and other carriers.
The Bureau of the Public Debt is substituted for the Federal Reserve Banks to reflect the consolidation of program
administration in Parkersburg, WV. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Section 344.3(b)(3)_The current rule requires that amendments to initial subscriptions be filed on or before
the issue date. As proposed, this section would add a 3 p.m., Eastern time, submission deadline. In addition, this
section would permit sending of amendments to initial subscriptions by facsimile, provided the notification is
clearly identified as an amendment and is immediately followed by the submission by mail or other carrier of written
notification of the amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Section 344.3(b)(3)(i)_This section would clarify that an amendment to an initial subscription may not change
the issue date to require issuance earlier than the issue date originally specified. In this section, the Bureau of
the Public Debt is substituted for the Federal Reserve Banks to reflect the consolidation of program administration
in Parkersburg, WV. The current regulation requires that changes under this section be submitted no later than one
business day before the originally specified issue date. As proposed, this section would add a 3 p.m., Eastern time,
submission deadline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Section 344.3(b)(3)(ii) and (iii)_This section would make technical changes required by the addition of new
section 344.3(b)(3)(iv). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Section 344.3(b)(3)(iv)_This new section would govern amendments to initial subscriptions which are not submitted
timely. Under this proposed new section, where an amendment is not submitted timely, the Division of Special Investments
may determine, pursuant to the provisions governing waiver of regulations set forth under 31 CFR 306.126, that such
an amendment is acceptable on an exception basis. Where an amendment is determined to be acceptable on an exception
basis, the amended information shall be used as the basis for issuing the securities, and an administrative fee of
$100 per subscription will be assessed. The Secretary reserves the right to reject amendments which are not submitted
timely.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(10) Section 344.3(c)_In this section, the Bureau of the Public Debt is substituted for the Federal Reserve Banks
to reflect the consolidation of program administration in Parkersburg, WV. The current rule requires that a final
subscription must be submitted on or before the issue date. As proposed, this section would add a 3 p.m., Eastern time,
submission deadline. In addition, this proposed section is updated to reflect sending of a final subscription by
facsimile equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(11) Section 344.3(c)(1)_A typographical error in the current regulation is corrected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(12) Section 344.4_The current section is divided into two parts, (a) and (b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(13) Section 344.4(a)_This section would require that the issue date selected by the subscriber must be a business
day and would allow for the sending of initial subscriptions by facsimile or other carrier. In this section, the Bureau
of the Public Debt is substituted for the Federal Reserve Banks. The current rule requires investors to make payment
by having their financial institution deposit funds in a reserve account for debit by a Federal Reserve Bank or Branch
on or before the date of issue. Under the proposed section, full payment for each subscription must be submitted utilizing
the Fedwire funds transfer system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(14) Section 344.4(b)_The current regulation provides that any subscriber which fails to make settlement on a subscription
once submitted is ineligible thereafter to subscribe for securities under this offering for a period of six months.
Under the current regulation, the Commissioner of the Public Debt may determine, given the circumstances of the case,
that the six month penalty need not apply. As proposed, the Division of Special Investments may determine to waive
the six month penalty, pursuant to the provisions governing waiver of regulations set forth under 31 CFR 306.126.
Where settlement occurs after the proposed issue date and the Division of Special Investments determines, pursuant
to 31 CFR 306.126, that settlement is acceptable on an exception basis, the six month penalty will be waived, and the
subscriber shall be subject to a late payment assessment. The assessment will include payment of an amount equal to
the amount of interest that would have accrued on the securities from the proposed issue date to the date of settlement,
as well as an administrative fee of $100 per subscription. Assessments under this subsection are due on demand. Failure
to pay an assessment shall render the subscriber ineligible thereafter to subscribe for securities under this offering
until the assessment is paid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(15) Section 344.5(b)(2)_This section would add a reference to a designated Treasury form and delete a reference
to wire as an authorized means of submitting notice for redemption prior to maturity. The agency's Parkersburg, WV,
address is substituted for its former Washington, DC, address. This proposed section would allow the notice of redemption
to be sent by facsimile or by other carriers. The current regulation provides that notice of redemption must be received
no less than 15 calendar days before the requested redemption date. However, owners are encouraged to provide as much
notice of redemption as possible to assure that payment can be timely made. As proposed, this section would provide
that notice be submitted no less than 15 calendar days and no more than 60 calendar days before the requested redemption
date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(16) Section 344.5(b)(3)(ii)_The current regulation states that the applicable rate table for determining the
``current borrowing rate'' is the one in effect on the day the request for early redemption is received or, where mailed,
the postmark date. This section would clarify that the applicable rate table is the one in effect on the day the request
for early redemption is telecopied, postmarked, or where delivered by other carrier, date-stamped.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 imposed arbitrage rebate requirements on issuers of tax-exempt bonds and directed the Department
of the Treasury to accommodate such requirements by enabling entities to invest qualifying funds in a Treasury money-market
type investment vehicle. Accordingly, the Department expanded the State and Local Government Series program, beginning
with its 1986 regulations, to include a demand deposit security offering. This security is not treated as investment
property for purposes of sections 143(g)(3) and 148 of the Internal Revenue Code and, therefore, enables eligible
entities to invest proceeds of tax-exempt bonds in an obligation which avoids the earning of arbitrage subject to
rebate. Proposed changes from the current rule are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Section 344.6(c)_A typographical error in the current regulation is corrected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Section 344.7(a)_A typographical error in the current regulation is corrected, and the Bureau of the Public Debt
is substituted for the Federal Reserve Banks to reflect the consolidation of program activities in Parkersburg,
WV. The current regulation provides that subscriptions must be received under this section at least three business
days before the issue date, by a 1 p.m., Eastern time, deadline. The proposed section would clarify that subscriptions
may be submitted by certified or registered mail, or by other carrier. In addition, the proposed section provides
that a subscription may be submitted by facsimile equipment, at least three business days before the issue date, provided
that the original subscription form is submitted by mail, or other carrier, and is received by the Bureau of the Public
Debt by 3 p.m., Eastern time, on the issue date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Section 344.7(b)_Current &sect;344.7(b) is redesignated &sect;344.7(c) and a new &sect;344.7(b) is added.
The current regulation provides that the principal amount to be invested may be changed without penalty so long as
notice is provided by 1 p.m., Eastern time, at least one business day before the issue date. The proposed section provides
that the principal amount to be invested may be changed without penalty on or before the issue date, but no later than
1 p.m., Eastern time, on the issue date. This section would allow for sending of amendments to original subscriptions
by facsimile, provided the notification is clearly identified as an amendment and is immediately followed by the
submission, by mail or other carrier, of written notification of the amendment. In addition, this section would provide
that, where an amendment is not submitted timely, the Division of Special Investments may determine, pursuant to
the provisions governing waiver of regulations set forth under 31 CFR 306.126, that such an amendment is acceptable
on an exception basis. Where an amendment is determined to be acceptable on an exception basis, the amended information
shall be used as the basis for issuing the securities, and an administrative fee of $100 per subscription will be assessed.
The Secretary reserves the right to reject amendments which are not submitted timely. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Section 344.7(c)_Current &sect;344.7(b) is redesignated as &sect;344.7(c). A typographical error in current
&sect;344.7(b)(5)(vii) is corrected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Section 344.8_The current section is divided into two parts, (a) and (b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Section 344.8(a)_In this section, the Bureau of the Public Debt is substituted for the Federal Reserve Banks to
reflect the consolidation of program activities in Parkersburg, WV. The current rule requires investors to deposit
funds in an account for debit by a Federal Reserve Bank or Branch on or before the date of issue. As proposed, this section
would require that full payment for each subscription be submitted utilizing the Fedwire funds transfer system.

(7) Section 344.8(b)_The current regulation provides that any subscriber which fails to make settlement on a subscription
once submitted is ineligible thereafter to subscribe for securities under this offering for a period of six months.
Under the current regulation, the Commissioner of the Public Debt may determine, given the circumstances of the case,
that the six month penalty need not apply. As proposed, the Division of Special Investments may determine to waive
the six month penalty, pursuant to the provisions governing waiver of regulations set forth under 31 CFR 306.126.
Where settlement occurs after the proposed issue date and the Division of Special Investments determines, pursuant
to 31 CFR 306.126, that such settlement is acceptable on an exception basis, the six month penalty will be waived, and
the subscriber shall be subject to a late payment assessment. The assessment will include payment of an amount equal
to the amount of interest that would have accrued on the securities from the proposed issue date to the date of settlement,
as well as an administrative fee of $100 per subscription. Assessments under this subsection are due on demand. Failure
to pay an assessment shall render the subscriber ineligible thereafter to subscribe for securities under this offering
until the assessment is paid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Section 344.9(b)_The Bureau of the Public Debt is substituted for the Federal Reserve Banks to reflect the consolidation
of program activities in Parkersburg, WV. This section would allow for sending of the notice of redemption by facsimile
or by other carriers. The notice must show the account number and the tax identification number of the subscriber.
Under this proposed section, the notice must be received at the Bureau of the Public Debt by 1 p.m., Eastern time, one
business day prior to the requested redemption date.

Subpart D_Special Zero Interest Securities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To give investors flexibility in investing certain proceeds that may become subject to yield restrictions, a new
special zero interest security was offered for the first time with the 1989 rule. Under the terms of this offering,
subscribers are not required to certify that as of the date of investment all the proceeds subject to yield restrictions
are being invested in State and Local Government securities. With exceptions, this offering is the same as that for
time deposit securities. Proposed changes from the 1989 rule are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Section 344.13_This section would add a reference to a designated Treasury form and delete a reference to wire
as an authorized means of submitting notice for redemption prior to maturity. The agency's Parkersburg, WV, address
is substituted for its former Washington, DC, address. In addition, the section would allow for sending of the notice
for redemption by facsimile or by other carriers. The current regulation provides that notice of redemption must
be received no less than 15 calendar days before the requested redemption date. However, owners are encouraged to
provide as much notice of redemption as possible to assure that payment can be timely made. Under this proposed section,
notice is to be submitted no less than 15 calendar days and no more than 60 calendar days before the requested redemption
date.

Procedural Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this proposed rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order
12866. Therefore, an assessment of anticipated benefits, costs and regulatory alternatives is not required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although this rule is being issued in proposed form to secure the benefit of public comment, the rule relates to matters
of public contract, as well as the borrowing power and fiscal authority of the United States. The notice and public
procedures requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act are inapplicable, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(2).
As no notice of proposed rulemaking is required, the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, et
seq.) do not apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The collections of information contained in this regulation have been previously reviewed and approved by the Office
of Management and Budget, in accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507) under
control number 1535&hyph;0091. The principal purpose of the proposed rule is to change the address of the receiving
entity. The revision would not impose a new collection of information requirement.

Interest rate.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Each security shall bear such rate of interest as the government body shall designate, but the rate shall not exceed
the maximum interest rate. The applicable maximum interest rates for each day shall equal rates shown in a table (Form
PD 4262), which will be released to the public by 10 a.m., Eastern time, each business day. If the Treasury finds that
due to circumstances beyond its control the rates will not be available to the public by 10 a.m., Eastern time, on any
given business day, it will provide an immediate announcement of that fact and advise that the applicable interest
for the last preceding business day shall apply. The applicable rate table for any subscription is the one in effect
on the date the initial subscription is telecopied, if transmitted by facsimile equipment, postmarked, if mailed,
or carrier date-stamped, if the initial subscription is delivered by other carrier. Subscriptions telecopied,
postmarked, or date-stamped on a non-business day will be subject to those interest rates which are in effect for the
next business day. The rates specified in the tables are one-eighth of one percent below the then current estimated
Treasury borrowing rate for a security of comparable maturity.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Interest on a certificate will be computed on an annual basis and will be paid at maturity with the principal. Interest
on a note or bond will be paid semiannually. The subscriber will specify the first interest payment date, which must
occur any time between 30 days and one year of the date of issue, and the final interest payment date must coincide with
the maturity date of the security. Interest for other than a full semiannual interest period is computed on the basis
of a 365-day or 366-day year (for certificates) and on the basis of the exact number of days in the half-year (for notes
and bonds). See appendix to subpart E of part 306 of this chapter for rules regarding computation of interest.

To the extent applicable, provisions of &sect;357.26 on ``Payments,'' as set forth in 31 CFR part 357 and provisions
of 31 CFR part 370, shall govern ACH payments made under this offering. For securities for which subscriptions were

or other carrier, of written notification. Amendments to initial subscriptions are acceptable with the following
exceptions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The issue date may not be changed to require issuance earlier than the issue date originally specified or to require
issuance more than seven calendar days later than originally specified. If such change is made, notification should

section; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(iv) Where an amendment is not submitted timely, the Division of Special Investments may determine, pursuant to the
provisions governing waiver of regulations set forth under 31 CFR 306.126, that such an amendment is acceptable on

shall be used as the basis for issuing the securities, and an administrative fee of $100 per subscription will be assessed.
The Secretary reserves the right to reject amendments which are not submitted timely. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) No initial subscription will be required where a final subscription is received or postmarked at least 15 calendar
days before the issue date. Such final subscription will be treated as the initial subscription for purposes of determining
the applicable interest rate table (see &sect;344.2(b)), and may be amended on or before the issue date, subject to
the exceptions in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Final subscriptions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A final subscription must be received by the Bureau of the Public Debt on or before the issue date, but no later than 3
p.m., Eastern time, on the issue date. The final subscription may be telecopied by facsimile equipment to the Bureau
of the Public Debt at (304) 480&hyph;6818 provided the facsimile is properly identified as a final subscription and
is immediately followed by the submission of the original subscription form by mail or other carrier. The final subscription
must be for a total principal amount that is no more than ten percent above or below the aggregate principal amount specified
in the initial subscription. The final subscription, dated and signed by an official authorized to make the purchase
and showing the taxpayer identification number of the beneficial owner, must be accompanied by a copy of the initial
subscription, where applicable. The various maturities, interest rates, and semiannual interest payment dates
(in the case of notes and bonds), must be specified in the final subscription, as well as the title(s) of the designated
official(s) authorized to request early redemption. Final subscriptions submitted for certificates, notes and
bonds must separately itemize securities of each maturity and each interest rate. The final subscription must contain
a certification by the subscriber that, as of the date of investment (without regard to any temporary period of no longer
than 30 days): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The total investment consists only of proceeds (including amounts treated as proceeds) of a tax-exempt bond issue
which are subject to yield restrictions under sections 141&hyph;150 of the Internal Revenue Code during the entire
period of investment; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The total investment is not less than all of such proceeds except for_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) An amount not to exceed $100, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Amounts required for payment due less than 30 days from the date of issue; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) None of the proceeds submitted in payment is derived (directly or indirectly) from the redemption before maturity
of other securities of the State and Local Government Series; and

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(4)(i) No portion of the investment is being made (directly or indirectly) with amounts that are to be used to discharge
a tax-exempt bond issue and that are derived or are to be derived (directly or indirectly) from the sale of escrowed
open market securities, the proceeds of which were to be used to discharge a tax-exempt bond issue; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Although a portion of the investment is being made (directly or indirectly) with amounts that are to be used to
discharge a tax-exempt bond issue and that are derived or are to be derived (directly or indirectly) from the sale of
escrowed open market securities, the proceeds of which were to be used to discharge a tax-exempt bond issue, the composite
yield to maturity of all investments being purchased with such amounts does not exceed the composite yield to maturity
of the securities that were sold, based on the price at which they were sold. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Where proceeds are subject to yield restrictions for a limited period of time, under paragraph (c)(1) of this section,
no investment of such proceeds beyond such period may be made. For example, if a reserve fund of a refunding issue is
subject to yield restrictions for a period of four years, the securities purchased as an investment of the reserve
fund may not have a maturity longer than four years. With respect to obligations described in section 103 of the Internal
Revenue Code issued after January 31, 1987, paragraph (c)(2) of this section is satisfied only if on the date of investment,
all the proceeds of the issue which are subject to yield restrictions are invested in State and Local Government Series
securities. Paragraph (c)(2) of this section does not apply to purpose investments, such as mortgage notes or student
loan obligations. Transferred proceeds of the tax exempt bond issue that were proceeds of another issue shall not
be treated as proceeds for purposes of paragraph (c)(2) of this section if no portion of the total investment consists
of such proceeds. See &sect;344.1(f) as to improper certifications.

thereof. Full payment for each subscription must be submitted by the Fedwire funds transfer system with credit directed
to the Treasury's General Account. Full payment should be submitted by 3 p.m., Eastern time, to ensure that settlement
on the securities occurs on the date of issue.

. The penalty imposed on any subscriber which fails to make settlement on a subscription once submitted shall be to
render the subscriber ineligible thereafter to subscribe for securities under this offering for a period of six months,
beginning on the date the subscription is withdrawn or the proposed issue date, whichever occurs first. The Division
of Special Investments may determine to waive the six month penalty, pursuant to the provisions governing waiver
of regulations set forth under 31 CFR 306.126. Where settlement occurs after the proposed issue date and the Division
of Special Investments determines, pursuant to 31 CFR 306.126, that settlement is acceptable on an exception basis,
the six month penalty will be waived, and the subscriber shall be subject to a late payment assessment. The assessment
will include payment of an amount equal to the amount of interest that would have accrued on the securities from the
proposed issue date to the date of settlement, as well as an administrative fee of $100 per subscription. Assessments
under this subsection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are due on demand. Failure to pay an assessment shall render the subscriber ineligible thereafter to subscribe for
securities under this offering until the assessment is paid.

Market charge
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. An amount shall be deducted from the redemption proceeds in all cases where the current borrowing rate of the Department
of the Treasury for the remaining period to original maturity of the security prematurely redeemed exceeds the rate
of interest originally fixed for such security. The amount shall be the present value of the future increased borrowing
cost to the Treasury. The annual increased borrowing cost for each interest period is determined by multiplying the
principal by the difference between the two rates. For notes and bonds, the increased borrowing cost for each remaining
interest period to original maturity is determined by dividing the annual cost by two. For certificates, the increased
borrowing cost for the remaining period to original maturity is determined by multiplying the annual cost by the number
of days remaining until original maturity divided by the number of days in the calendar year. Present value shall be
determined by using the current borrowing rate as the discount factor. The term ``current borrowing rate'' means
the applicable rate shown in the table of maximum interest rates payable on United States Treasury securities_State
and Local Government Series_for the day the request for early redemption is telecopied, postmarked, or where delivered
by other carrier, date-stamped, plus one-eighth of one percentage point. Where redemption is requested as of a date
less than 30 calendar days before the original maturity date, such applicable rate is the rate shown for a security
with a maturity of 30 days. The market charge for bonds, notes, and certificates of indebtedness can be computed by
use of the formulas in Appendix A to this part.

Subscriptions from December 28, 1976 through August 31, 1989
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. For securities subscribed for from December 28, 1976 through August 31, 1989, the amount of the redemption proceeds
is calculated as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Interest
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Interest for the entire period the security was outstanding shall be recalculated on the basis of the lesser of the
original interest rate at which the security was issued, or the interest rate that would have been set at the time of
the initial subscription had the term for the security been for the shorter period. If a note or bond is redeemed before
maturity on a date other than a scheduled interest payment date, no interest will be paid for the fractional interest
period since the last interest payment date.

(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Overpayment of interest
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If there have been overpayments of interest, as determined under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, there shall
be deducted from the redemption proceeds the aggregate amount of such overpayments, plus interest, compounded semiannually,
thereon from the date of each overpayment to the date of redemption. The interest rate to be used in calculating the
interest on the overpayment shall be one-eighth of one percent above the maximum rate that would have applied to the
initial subscription had the term of the security been for the shorter period.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. An amount shall be deducted from the redemption proceeds in all cases where the current borrowing rate of the Department
of the Treasury for the remaining period to original maturity of the security prematurely redeemed exceeds the rate
of interest originally fixed for such security. The amount shall be calculated using the formula in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)
of this section.

as follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The interest for the entire period the security was outstanding shall be recalculated on the basis of the lesser
of the original interest rate at which the security was issued, or an adjusted interest rate reflecting both the shorter
period during which the security was actually outstanding and a penalty. The adjusted interest rate is the Treasury
rate which would have been in effect on the date of issuance for a marketable Treasury certificate, note, or bond maturing
on the quarterly maturity date prior to redemption (in the case of certificates), or on the semiannual maturity period
prior to redemption (in the case of notes and bonds), reduced in either case by a penalty which shall be the lesser of:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) One-eighth of one percent times the number of months from the date of issuance to original maturity, divided by
the number of full months elapsed from the date of issue to redemption, or

. (1) Each security shall bear a variable rate of interest based on an adjustment of the average yield for three-month
Treasury bills at the most recent auction. A new rate will be effective on the first business day following the regular
auction of three-month Treasury bills and will be shown in the table (Form PD 4262), available to the public on such
business day. Interest will be accrued and added to the principal daily. Interest will be computed on the balance of
the principal, plus interest accrued through the immediately preceding day.

. Interest earned on the securities will be added to the principal and will be reinvested daily until redemption. At
any time the Secretary determines that issuance of obligations sufficient to conduct the orderly financing operations
of the United States cannot be made without exceeding the statutory debt limit, the Department will invest any unredeemed
demand deposit securities in special 90-day certificates of indebtedness. These 90-day certificates will be payable
at maturity, but redeemable before maturity, provided funds are available for redemption, or reinvested in demand
deposit securities when regular Treasury borrowing operations resume, both at the owner's option. Funds invested
in the 90-day certificates of indebtedness will earn simple interest equal to the daily factor in effect at the time
demand deposit security issuance is suspended, multiplied by the number of days outstanding.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Solely for purposes of this paragraph (c)(3), gross proceeds previously invested at any time pursuant to any
exception in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, other than paragraph (c)(5)(vi) (Exception 6) (relating to amounts
of less than $25,000) and paragraph (c)(5)(viii) (Exception 8) (relating to inadvertent error).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Exception 2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The subscriber shall fix the issue date on the subscription, the issue date to be a business day at least three business
days after receipt of the subscription by the Division of Special Investments. Full payment for each subscription
must be submitted by the Fedwire funds transfer system with credit directed to the Treasury's General Account. Full

The penalty imposed on any subscriber which fails to make settlement on a subscription once submitted shall be to render
the subscriber ineligible thereafter to subscribe for securities under this offering for a period of six months,
beginning on the date the subscription is withdrawn or the proposed issue date, whichever occurs first. The Division
of Special Investments may determine to waive the six month penalty, pursuant to the provisions governing waiver
of regulations set forth under 31 CFR 306.126. Where settlement occurs after the proposed issue date and the Division
of Special Investments determines, pursuant to 31 CFR 306.126, that settlement is acceptable on an exception basis,
the six month penalty will be waived, and the subscriber shall be subject to a late payment assessment. The assessment
will include payment of an amount equal to the amount of interest that would have accrued on the securities from the
proposed issue date to the date of settlement, as well as an administrative fee of $100 per subscription. Assessments
under this subsection are due on demand. Failure to pay an assessment shall render the subscriber ineligible thereafter
to subscribe for securities under this offering until the assessment is paid.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On August 10, 1994 the EPA proposed to approve, through ``direct final'' procedure, the exemption request from the
requirements contained in section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act (Act) for the Detroit-Ann Arbor ozone nonattainment
area in Michigan. See 59 FR 40840 (proposed rule) and 59 FR 40826 (final rule). The EPA has received adverse comments
and requests for an extension of the public comment period. As a result, the public comment period will be extended
an additional 30 days from the date of the publication of this action. Under the ``direct final'' procedures all public
comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule (based upon the proposed rule cited above).

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region II announces its intent to delete the Radium Chemical Company site,
Woodside, Queens County, New York from the NPL and requests public comment on these actions. The NPL constitutes appendix
B to the NCP, which EPA promulgated pursuant to section 105 of CERCLA, as amended. The EPA identifies sites that appear
to present a significant risk to public health, welfare, or the environment and maintains the NPL as the list of those
sites. Sites on the NPL may be the subject of remedial actions financed by the Hazardous Substances Superfund Response
Trust Fund (Fund). Pursuant to &sect;300.425(e)(3) of the NCP, any site deleted from the NPL remains eligible for
Fund-financed remedial actions, if conditions at the site warrant such action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA will accept comments concerning the Radium Chemical Company site for thirty days after publication of this
notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Federal Register.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section II of this notice explains the criteria for deleting sites from the NPL. Section III discusses procedures
that EPA is using for these actions. Section IV discusses how the sites meet the deletion criteria.

The NCP establishes the criteria the Agency uses to delete sites from the NPL. In accordance with 40 CFR Section 300.425(e),
sites may be deleted from the NPL where no further response is appropriate. In making this determination, EPA will

III. Deletion Procedures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NCP provides that EPA shall not delete a site from the NPL until the State in which the release was located has concurred,
and the public has been afforded an opportunity to comment on the proposed deletion. Deletion of a site from the NPL
does not affect responsible party liability or impede agency efforts to recover costs associated with response efforts.
The NPL is designed primarily for informational purposes and to assist Agency management.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA Region II will accept and evaluate public comments before making a final decision to delete. The Agency believes
that deletion procedures should focus on notice and comment at the local level. Comments from the local community
may be the most pertinent to deletion decisions. The following procedures were used for the intended deletion of the
Radium Chemical Company site:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. EPA Region II has recommended deletion and has prepared the relevant documents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The State of New York has concurred with the deletion decisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Concurrent with this Notice of Intent to Delete, a notice has been published in local newspapers and has been distributed
to appropriate federal, state and local officials, and other interested parties. This notice announces a thirty-day
public comment period on the deletion package, which starts two weeks from the date of the notice, October 15, 1994,
and will conclude on November 15, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The Region has made all relevant documents available in the Regional Office and local site information repositories.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments received during the notice and comment period will be evaluated before any final decision is made. EPA
Region II will prepare a Responsiveness Summary, which will address the comments received during the public comment
period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The deletion will occur after the EPA Regional Administrator places a Notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The NPL will reflect any deletions in the next final update. Public notices and copies of the Responsiveness Summary
will be made available to local residents by the Region II Office.

IV. Basis for Intended Deletion of the Radium Chemical Company Site
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Radium Chemical Company (RCC) site is located at 60&hyph;06 27th Avenue in Woodside, Queens County, New York,
in a light industrial/residential sector. The site consisted of a 1-story brick building (and a part of a second brick
building which shared a wall with this building) bordered on the west by 27th Avenue and on the east by the Brooklyn-Queens
Expressway (BQE), a major roadway into New York City.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Founded in New York in 1913, RCC initially produced luminous paint for watch dials and instruments. Later, the company
manufactured, leased and sold radium-226 in the form of implant sources to hospitals, medical centers, and research
laboratories. In the late 1950's, RCC transferred its operations to the present location in Woodside, New York. The
radium and radon devices were stored on-site in lead containers in a brick vault room. Eventually the demand for radium
sources lagged as they were replaced with advanced radiotherapy techniques using cesium and cobalt sources. Subsequently,
many leased radium sources were returned to RCC and were stored on-site.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1983, the State of New York suspended the RCC operating license due to various disposal and safety infractions.
RCC attempted to obtain permission to begin operations again in 1986, but was denied. The New York State Department
of Labor issued its first Stipulation and Order against RCC on October 17, 1987, for the removal of the radium sources
and decontamination of the building. The owner was unable to finance the remediation and, subsequently, abandoned
the building. This resulted in a second Stipulation and Order, issued on July 20, 1988, determining that the facility
could not be maintained and that it was 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 abandoned by RCC. Remaining on-site were a large number of radium-containing sealed devices, some of which were suspected
of releasing radium and radon gas. The amount of radium-226 at the site was established to be 110 Curies (Ci). Also on-site
were hundreds of containers of laboratory chemicals, many of which were reactive, corrosive, flammable, and/or
potentially shock-sensitive.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In July 1988, at the request of the State of New York, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) undertook a limited
emergency removal action under CERCLA, et seq., to secure the facility and remove the radioactive sources. EPA provided
24-hour security and initiated measures to stabilize the site. By August 1988, EPA had erected fencing around the
perimeter and installed remote monitoring surveillance, a foam fire suppressant system, special vents, and other
safety measures. In February 1989, EPA contracted with Chem-Nuclear Systems, Inc. to remove the radium sources and
other hazardous materials from the site and transport them to approved disposal facilities. The removal action was
completed in October 1989. Approximately 120 Ci of radium in the form of sources, contaminated debris, and loose radium
salts and luminous compounds were removed from the site. This material was disposed of at facilities located in Richland,
Washington and Beatty, Nevada, both operated by U.S. Ecology.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 10, 1989, at EPA's request, the U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) issued a
Public Health Advisory to alert the public, EPA, and the State of New York of a serious threat to human health, based
on the threatened release of radium-226 from the RCC site. In an August 1989 special NPL update, EPA proposed the RCC
site for the NPL based on the ATSDR advisory. On November 21, 1989, the RCC site was added to the National Priorities
List.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA completed a Focused Feasibility Study (FFS) of the site in April 1990. Excessive levels of Rn-222 and Ra-226 remained
in the RCC facility, along with various radium contaminated hazardous chemicals. On June 21, 1990, EPA signed a Record
of Decision (ROD) selecting a remedy for the RCC site. The ROD called for the following remedial activities at the site:
decontamination of the RCC facility; dismantlement of the RCC building; excavation of contaminated soils and subsurface
structures; and transport and disposal of wastes to an approved waste disposal facility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA community relations activities at the site included a public meeting in May 1990 to present the results of the
FFS and the preferred alternative for remediation of the site. All public comments received were addressed. A major
concern of the public was the disruption to the local businesses caused by street closings. EPA held subsequent meetings
with the local business owners to determine the least obtrusive method for achieving our needs.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The remedial action at the site began in September 1990 with limited mobilization of the Site for surveying purposes.
On-site decontamination began on November 16, 1990 and the first shipment of radioactive wastes left the Site on July
11, 1991. The RCC building was decontaminated and dismantled. A portion of an adjoining building, leased by RCC, was
fully decontaminated and restored. Dismantling, excavation, and restoration activities were essentially completed
by January 1993. Removal of all wastes from the site and revegetation was completed in August 1993. A limited excavation
of soils surrounding a sewer line adjacent to the RCC property was conducted during July 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approximately 812 tons of radioactive soil and debris and 92 cubic feet of radium-contaminated hazardous wastes
were transported to the Envirocare of Utah, Inc. facility in Clive, Utah for disposal. Approximately 862 tons of uncontaminated
masonry and concrete building debris were transported to the Fresh Kills Landfill on Staten Island, New York for disposal.
Other wastes, including approximately 45 tons of elemental lead and 20 tons of structural steel, were transported
to the Scientific Ecology Group (SEG), Inc. facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee for decontamination and recycling to
the nuclear industry. Approximately 2.5 Ci of tritium watch faces were transported to the Chem-Nuclear Systems,
Inc. facility in Barnwell, South Carolina for disposal. Approximately 36.7 kilograms of radium-contaminated elemental
mercury were transported to the University of Tennessee for decontamination, followed by ultimate disposal of the
treated residuals at the Chem-Nuclear facility in Barnwell, South Carolina and recycling of the decontaminated
elemental mercury. Approximately 1.03 millicuries, associated with a radium calibration source, was transported
to Rutgers University for use in radon-generation research. Confirmatory sampling showing the site has been decontaminated
below the required levels, that contaminated soils have been excavated and disposed of off-site, and that the site
has been backfilled with clean soil, provide further assurance that the site no longer poses any threats to human health
or the environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA, with concurrence of the State of New York, has determined that all appropriate Fund-financed responses under
CERCLA at the Radium Chemical Company site have been completed, and that no further cleanup is necessary.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The FHWA announces a Determination which will extend, for thirty days, waivers issued to certain vision-impaired
drivers as part of a study instituted in July, 1992. The purpose of the study is to gather information and data to determine
whether there should be a change in the current vision standards for operators of commercial motor vehicles (CMVs)
in interstate commerce, or provision for individualized waivers. This action is directed solely at those drivers
who had been granted temporary waivers to participate in the previously authorized vision waiver study, who numbered
2,411 as of September 30, 1994. This Notice also proposes to revalidate the waivers, allowing the aforementioned
drivers to continue to participate in the study until its conclusion, which will occur on or before March 31, 1996.
This revalidation would be based upon the Determination made in this document. This action follows, and is consistent
with, the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in the case captioned Advocates for Highway and
Auto Safety v. Federal Highway Administration, 28 F.3d 1288, D.C. Cir. 1994, which vacated the rule authorizing the
temporary waivers and remanded the matter to the agency for further action not inconsistent with the Court's ruling.

 Section 206(f) of the Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1984, (MCSA) Pub. L. No. 98&hyph;554, 98 Stat. 2832 (codified at 49
U.S.C. 31136(e), formerly 49 U.S.C. app. 2505(f)) allows the Secretary of Transportation to grant waivers from the
Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations only after a determination that such waivers are not contrary to the public
interest and are consistent with the safe operation of CMVs. Historically, except for a limb-handicap waiver program
established in 1979 (49 CFR 391.49), the agency had granted no individual waivers to drivers who did not meet the physical
qualification requirements set forth at 49 CFR 391.41.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This standard has been applied absolutely in the sense that any individual who does not meet the standard is determined
to be physically unqualified to drive a CMV in interstate commerce without further consideration of individual ability.
Public policy enunciated in the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Pub. L. 93&hyph;112, 87 Stat. 355, as amended) and the
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1991 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;336, 104 Stat. 327, as amended) indicates that a preferable
standard would allow drivers to demonstrate their individual ability to drive safely, in spite of their vision deficiency.
However, because no practical means of testing the ability of an individual with various vision deficiencies to safely
operate a CMV were known to exist, except actual driving experience, the agency could not grant waivers and be certain
that such waivers were ``consistent with the safe operation of commercial motor vehicles'' as required by the MCSA.
The FHWA determined that a group of drivers did exist who, although they did not meet the standard, had already demonstrated
their ability to drive safely. These drivers were either operating in intrastate commerce and subject to a less stringent
State vision standard, or were operating, unwittingly or otherwise, in contravention of the existing interstate
standard. Adoption of the Federal standard by many States, along with stepped-up enforcement at both the State and
Federal levels, exposed these drivers to disqualification determinations. This was not inadvertent, however.
Laws enacted over the past ten years have effectively increased resources dedicated to the enforcement of the Federal
safety regulations or compatible State regulations by a factor of ten. Congress has insisted on uniform standards
consistent with Federal regulations issued pursuant to the MCSA of 1984, and has authorized programs to encourage
states to adopt those standards. Moreover, Federal regulations implementing the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety
Act of 1986 and its commercial driver's license provisions, have further helped detect drivers operating in interstate
commerce who did not meet the Federal physical qualification requirements. Because of these efforts, more than 5,000
unqualified drivers have been identified and removed from interstate driving positions. That is, in fact, the intent
of establishing minimum Federal standards and insuring they are enforced.

Vision Waiver Study
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the same time that these enforcement efforts were increasing, heightened awareness of the rights of disabled individuals,
and the fact that some of the physical qualification standards were absolute in that they permitted no demonstration
of ability notwithstanding the physical deficit, caused the FHWA to reexamine its vision standard. Several research
studies, although acknowledging that visual capacity was an essential element of safe commercial vehicle operation,
had failed to fully resolve the issue of what level of visual capacity would be required to assure safety. The FHWA decided
to conduct a further study in an attempt to gather essential information that would lead to an improved standard. The
difficulties with some of the previous studies included insufficient subjects and the absence of exposure data.
The FHWA believed these difficulties could be overcome, in part, by using as subjects drivers who, although they did
not meet the Federal vision standards, had been safely operating CMVs for some time and were now, for the reasons mentioned
above, becoming more readily identifiable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA announced its vision waiver study in a Notice of Intent to accept applications for waivers on March 25, 1992,
(57 FR 10295). The intent of the proposed program was to obtain valuable information on the relationship between visual
capacity and the ability to operate a CMV safely. This vision waiver study was initiated as part of an overall regulatory
review of the medical qualification standards applicable to interstate CMV drivers. It was also responsive to several
Congressional Committee reports accompanying the Americans With Disabilities Act directing the Secretary within
two years to ``undertake a thorough review of (the driver qualification) regulations to ascertain whether the standards
conform with current knowledge *&blank;*&blank;* and whether such regulations are valid under this Act.'' (42 U.S.C.
12101, Pub. L. 101&hyph;336, 104 Stat. 327). (See H. Rep. 596, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 60&hyph;61 (1990) (conference
report); H. Rep. 485, Part 2, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 57 (1990) (House Committee on Education and Labor); H. Rep. 458,

A further notice with request for comments was published on June 3, 1992, (57 FR 23370), and a notice of final disposition
was published on July 16, 1992, (57 FR 31458). The period during which applications for participation in this waiver
program would be considered expired on December 31, 1992, after having been extended from September 21, 1992 (57 FR
45002, September 30, 1992). Over 3,700 applications were received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assure consistency with safety, the FHWA set minimum requirements which a driver would have to meet before being
considered eligible for a waiver. These included visual acuity of at least 20/40 (Snellen) in the better eye, three
years driving experience with the vision deficiency, a safe driving record for that period, and a report on the condition
of the applicant's vision from an ophthalmologist or optometrist, including an opinion as to the driver's ability
to operate a CMV safely with the condition. A safe driving record was defined as the absence of chargeable accidents,
no convictions for serious traffic offenses, and no more than two convictions for other moving violations. The agency
based its requirement that drivers participating in the study have a three-year safe driving history with their vision
impairment upon studies (discussed more fully in ``Rationale for the Determination'') indicating that past experience
can be used to predict future performance, especially when combined with other predictive factors such as geographic
location, mileage driven, and conviction history. The agency also relied upon opinions from the medical community
that individuals with vision impairments are often able to compensate for that impairment over a period of time. Because
of the discrepancy as to how much time is necessary to allow an individual to compensate for an impairment (which generally
ranged from several months to a full year), the agency's choice of three years provided added assurance that drivers
would have had sufficient time to develop compensatory behavior. It was also the longest period for which driver histories
were uniformly available from State motor vehicle departments (MVD).

Court Decision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety (Advocates) filed suit in the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C.
Circuit, requesting a review of the FHWA's notice of final disposition granting waivers to individuals who otherwise
did not meet the Federal vision standard required for the qualification of CMV drivers in interstate commerce. The
Advocates asserted that the waiver program was in violation of the Administrative Procedures Act (5 U.S.C. 553) because
the rule implementing the program was not issued with opportunity for meaningful comment and was otherwise arbitrary,
capricious, or not in accordance with law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A three-judge panel for the D.C. Circuit issued its opinion in the case on August 2, 1994. The Court found that the FHWA's
notices of the program did provide for meaningful comment and that the comments received were given consideration.
The Court also held that the FHWA's approach, given the apparently conflicting demands, was reasonable, and therefore
not arbitrary and capricious. The Court observed, however, that the FHWA ``initiated a program to issue temporary
waivers to visually impaired drivers in order to procure the hard evidence needed to determine the effect of visual
deficiencies on safety. Yet, before it may grant a waiver, the Safety Act required the agency to determine that such
waiver *&blank;*&blank;* is consistent with the safe operation of commercial motor vehicles.'' 28 F.3d at 1294.
The Court found that the agency's ``determination that the waiver program will not adversely affect the safe operation
of CMVs is devoid of empirical support in the record,'' 28 F.3d at 1294, and that ``the FHWA has failed to meet the exacting
requirements of section 2505(f) (now 49 U.S.C. 31136(e)).'' 28 F.3d at 1294. Consequently, the Court concluded that
the FHWA's adoption of the waiver program was contrary to law, and vacated and remanded the rule to the agency.

Rationale for the Determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice of determination is issued in response to the Court's remand. The FHWA has analyzed the Court's decision
and its effect on the vision waiver study, and has evaluated evidence that was not before the Court, including considerable
data gathered through the vision waiver study during its two years of operation. As of September 30, 1994, there were
2,411 individuals participating in the vision waiver study. Unless the agency acts on the D.C. Circuit Court's remand,
the waivers, without which most of these drivers would not be qualified, would have to be rescinded immediately because
the decision of the Court, when mandated, will invalidate the existing rule authorizing the waivers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generally, a truck driver's ability to operate is demonstrated by possession of a currently valid commercial driver's
license or other authorized license, and based upon other safety-related information pertaining to the type of vehicle
to be operated. A commercial driver's license or other authorized license is issued after subjecting the driver to
knowledge and performance tests usually administered in the course of a few hours. Some employers may add a performance
test, or a safe driving probationary period before permanent employment. How safely the driver may operate thereafter
is based on compliance with traffic laws and regulations and involvement in accidents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The drivers accepted for the waiver study had to meet the licensing requirement of their States and any employer-mandated
prerequisites, in addition to demonstrating beforehand a safe driving record for three years as required by the Vision
Waiver Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By allowing these drivers to continue to drive under a waiver program, i.e., in effect, grandfathering them, the FHWA
placed itself in the position of receiving information on the relationship between visual capacity and the ability
to operate a CMV safely. Because they did not meet existing vision standards, these drivers could not be allowed to
operate in interstate commerce, unless they obtained waivers. The Court acknowledged that ``this approach may be
entirely reasonable,'' but it found that the FHWA lacked data to support the conclusion that the conditions it imposed
on the granting of waivers assured consistency with the safe operation of CMVs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to revalidate the waivers, and to remain consistent with the Court's remand, the FHWA is relying upon several
research studies demonstrating the effectiveness of methods to ascertain the probability of an individual experiencing
accidents in the future based on accident history. The first major effort in this area was done in England by Greenwood
and Yule in 1920. Subsequent studies, building on that model, concluded that accident rates for the same individual
exposed to certain risks for two different time periods vary only slightly. (See Bates and Neyman, University of California
Publications in Statistics, April 1952.) Other studies demonstrated theories of predicting accident proneness
from accident history coupled with other factors. These factors, such as age, sex, geographic location, mileage
driven and conviction history, are used every day by insurance companies and motor vehicle bureaus to predict the
probability of an individual experiencing future accidents. (See Weber, Donald C., ``Accident Rate Potential:
An Application of Multiple Regression Analysis of a Poisson Process,'' Journal of American Statistical Association,
June, 1971). A 1964 California Driver Record Study prepared by the California Department of Motor Vehicles concluded
that the best overall accident predictor for both concurrent and nonconcurrent events is the number of single convictions.
This California study used three consecutive years of data, comparing the experience of drivers in the first two years
with the experience of those same drivers the final year. Copies of the several studies relied upon here have been added
to the docket.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based upon the studies and practices noted above, the FHWA has determined that three years safe driving experience
with the vision deficiency not only allowed for sufficient adjustment by drivers to the condition, but also provided
for the longest period of experience for which records were uniformly available from which to predict future performance.
As noted above, the California study was limited to a two-year base period because, like many jurisdictions, the accumulation
of accurate driver histories does not exceed three years. The use of a three-year base period improves the predictability
of the future period because the longer the period, the more likely the elimination of random anomalies. (See Bates
and Neyman, University of California Publications in Statistics, April 1952.) Therefore, the FHWA believes it has
required and applied a sufficiently long period of safe driving to project continued safe driving over a future period
of the same duration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA accepted only those drivers with no chargeable accidents for the three-year period of most recent driving
experience. This translated into no chargeable accidents, as verified through motor vehicle records, in approximately
300 million vehicle miles travelled (VMT), as reported by the applicants. Although the FHWA certainly could not conclude
that this rate would remain at zero, some of the studies noted above concluded that the correlation between the accident
experience of the same individual over two different time periods was strongest when the rate of accidents was lowest.
Moreover, the FHWA is confident that the chargeable accident rate of the general commercial driving population over
three years could not be less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 0. In fact, the chargeable accident rate for the year 1991, the year prior to the inception of the vision study,
for the general truck driving population was 0.46 per 1 million vmt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the waived drivers were not permitted to continue to drive, they would have to be replaced by other drivers. These
``replacement'' drivers come from the general commercial driving population, which includes new, inexperienced
commercial drivers. The FHWA has established that the chargeable accident rate for the general commercial driving
population for the year 1992 well exceeds that of the drivers participating in the vision waiver program. Information
about the past performance of new, inexperienced commercial drivers, many of whom are younger in age, does not exist.
Studies have shown, however, that younger drivers of passenger vehicles produce the highest accident rates. Consequently,
the agency required a three-year experience factor for applicants to the waiver program as a means of eliminating
a similar risk posed by inexperienced commercial drivers. See Wyckoff, D. Truck Drivers in America, D.C. Heath &amp;
Co., Lexington, Mass. 1979. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The good driving record demonstrated by the waiver applicants not only required the absence of chargeable accidents
over a three-year period, but also the absence of serious traffic violations and no more than two minor traffic violations.
According to the California Driver Record Study mentioned above, this is the best predictor of future safe driving.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirement of three years safe driving experience with the vision deficit severely limited participation by
the highest accident-risk age group. Each driver's application was individually examined, any missing information
was required to be furnished, and each driver was measured against the waiver standards to assure that all the conditions
were met, i.e., individualized determinations were made on the basis of complete data submitted by each applicant,
to determine eligibility for participation in the waiver program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA now has new, significant data, which had also not been considered by the Court in reaching its decision, to
support its present determination. The vision waiver study has now been in effect since July 1992, and has collected
driver safety and performance data periodically for approximately two years. Individuals driving pursuant to waivers
are required to submit reports of vehicle miles travelled monthly. They are also required to report any citation for
a moving violation involving a CMV and the judicial or administrative disposition of such charge, and, within 15 days
of occurrence, any accident involvement whatsoever while operating a CMV. All accident information is verified
periodically through each driver's State motor vehicle record (MVR) by the FHWA's contractor, Conwal, Inc. of Falls
Church, Virginia. Participants in the waiver program also submitted, prior to their acceptance, detailed information
of their individual vital statistics, employment history, current status of driving privilege as recorded on the
licensing State's MVR and the license status for the past three years, and expert medical opinion by an ophthalmologist
or optometrist as to current visual acuity and its effect on his or her ability to perform the driving task safely. Participating
drivers are required to submit annual reports from an ophthalmologist or optometrist attesting to the present condition
of their vision. Any loss of vision bringing them below the waiver standard of 20/40 in the better eye results in immediate
discharge from the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Drivers participating in the program are subject to revocation of their waiver for failure to meet certain reporting
requirements or if the vision in their better eye falls below the required standard. The agency strictly holds waived
drivers to these requirements and standards. As of September 30, 1994, a total of 201 drivers have had their waivers
revoked. Of that number, 21 drivers were revoked for failing to submit an annual medical exam. The remaining 180 drivers
were revoked for failing to submit monthly driving reports on time. No drivers have had their waivers revoked for decreasing
visual acuity; however, two drivers have voluntarily withdrawn from the program on this basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon statistical analysis of this information conducted by the contractor, the agency can conclude that the
driving performance of individuals participating in the vision waiver program is better than the driving performance
of all CMV drivers collectively, based on data obtained from the General Estimates Service (GES). The GES is a national
survey conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and was selected for use as the best measure
of the prevailing national norm relative to large truck accidents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Third Interim Monitoring Report, prepared by the contractor responsible for FHWA's vision waiver program, dated
June 27, 1994, reported on the cumulative driving performance of those individuals participating in the waiver group
between July 1992 and February 1994. During that period, a total of 211 accidents were reported and a total of 136.4
million VMT had been recorded. The number of accidents in this period divided by the VMT give an accident rate of 1.547
accidents per million VMT. The national accident rate for large truck accidents, as reported by the GES for the year
1992, is 2.531 accidents per million VMT. A copy of this report is contained in the docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reports submitted by the drivers are independently verified through periodic records checks with State MVDs.
While drivers in the study are required to report all accident involvement, the State MVDs only record accidents warranting
reports under existing State requirements. Similarly, the GES data only contain accidents recorded by State MVDs.
Therefore, the drivers in the waiver study are held accountable for more accidents than those included in GES statistics.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA's contractor, which is performing the data collection, the statistical analysis and preparation of the
interim reports, was subjected to a peer review of its procedures and methodology, a summary of which is included in
the docket. A Fourth Interim Report is in preparation at this time, and covers cumulative activities and mileage through
June 30, 1994. A review of the data indicates that the performance of the study group remains relatively unchanged,
as the accident rate is only slightly higher than previously reported, i.e. 1.636 accidents per one million VMT. The
completed report will be placed in the docket along with all preceding Interim Reports.

FHWA's Determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Statistical studies mentioned above support the proposition that accident-free performance coupled with low numbers
of traffic violations over a three-year period is a reliable predictor of continued safe performance over a similar
period in the future. As a condition of admission into the waiver program, each applicant had to demonstrate a three-year
period of safe driving performance prior to being admitted into the study group. The performance data obtained from
the waived drivers since the study began confirms the FHWA's determination that the continued operation of the waived
group, as provided for in this notice, will not diminish safety. The data also show that this class of drivers performed
and is performing more safely than the pool of drivers from which its replacements would have to be drawn, that is, the
general driving population. Accordingly, the FHWA has determined that to revalidate waivers, as stated in this notice,
for drivers in the class of drivers defined by the study and operating under the conditions of the study is consistent
with the safe operation of CMVs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This evidence, examined in conjunction with the previously available medical and scientific evidence, and detailed
driving records provided prior to acceptance into the waiver program and periodically thereafter by each individual
participating in the waiver group, clearly indicates that the continued operation of CMVs by the group of drivers
currently participating in the waiver program will not adversely affect CMV safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA has also determined that to conduct the waiver study program under the conditions prescribed herein is consistent
with the public interest of assuring the physical condition of operators of CMVs is adequate to enable them to operate
the vehicles safely and of providing opportunities for drivers with real or perceived visual disabilities to demonstrate
their ability to drive safely and continue in their chosen field of occupation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the FHWA believes that the information contained in this notice provides a sufficient degree of empirical
evidence to satisfy the safety requirement mandated by both the MCSA and the D.C. Circuit Court. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Revalidation of Waivers and Request for Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In view of the above, the agency is revalidating the vision waivers possessed by drivers as of September 30, 1994, for
thirty days from the date of this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA is also proposing that this evidence is sufficient to allow those drivers currently participating in the
vision waiver study (2,411 as of September 30, 1994) to continue operating CMVs with waivers, subject to the same standards
and conditions applicable to the original waivers, for the duration of the study, which shall conclude not later than
March 31, 1996. By that date, approximately 93 percent of the drivers presently participating in the study will have
completed at least three years driving in the study program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA is requesting comments on this proposal. A short comment period is necessitated by the precarious position
in which the drivers participating in the study, as well as the FHWA, are placed by virtue of the Court's decision. If
this determination is delayed, individuals who have received a waiver from the application of certain regulations
will immediately be subject to irreparable harm in the form of job loss and financial hardship. Moreover, if the agency
allows the waiver program to continue without presenting a reasoned analysis and justification, it could be found
to be acting contrary to the order of the Court. Finally, this additional period of 15 days for comments will allow for
the submission of persuasive reasons why the FHWA should not complete its study by revalidating waivers to the study
participants subject to the same standards or conditions.

Public Hearing on the Vision Standard and Waiver Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Due to the strong public interest surrounding this matter, the FHWA will conduct a public hearing within six months
of the date of this notice of determination to explore the remaining issues surrounding the vision standard and the
vision waiver program. Examples of issues to be addressed at the public hearing include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The relationship of visual capacity to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial driving task; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Identification of research and data helpful in defining the vision standard;

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) What additional research is needed to help the FHWA define its vision standard; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Upon conclusion of the Vision Waiver Program, what should be the driving status of waived drivers, assuming continued
safe driving performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA is eager to gain a broader perspective of the public's viewpoint concerning other studies, data and experiences
which will enhance the agency's knowledge on the subject. The FHWA is also interested in sharing its data with other
researchers and modes which may undertake useful analysis and initiate studies leading to more enlightened approaches
to establishing future physical qualification standards, standards that are both necessary and valid to increasing
opportunities in the truck-driving profession while ensuring that society's high expectations of CMV safety are
realized. Notice of the hearing will be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Conclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA will publish, within 30 days of the date of publication of this notice, its determination regarding the continuation
of the vision waiver program through the proposed March 31, 1996 deadline. This determination will be based upon comments
received in response to this notice, as well as all empirical evidence gathered to date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the FHWA determines, based upon comments and related information, not to extend the program to such date, the agency
will publish its rationale for such determination and the date upon which waived drivers may no longer operate in interstate
commerce. Additionally, waived drivers will be notified directly of the agency's decision to terminate the program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the FHWA determines, based upon comments and related information, that the waiver program may continue until March
31, 1996, the agency will also publish that determination as well in the

Conditions for Retaining A Vision Waiver Once Issued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There would be special requirements attached to any waiver issued to a vision-impaired driver. These requirements
would be imposed to ensure that the FHWA receives the data needed to complete the research effort. The reporting requirements,
a six month verification of every waived driver's MVR, and the CDL standards applicable to waived drivers will ensure
that unsafe, vision-impaired drivers are removed from operation in the same manner as other unsafe drivers. Waived
drivers will not be afforded any additional privileges that would allow them to operate differently from other CMV
drivers in interstate commerce. Each driver would be required to:

 The Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) requires that each Regional Fishery Management
Council submit any FMP or amendment it prepares to the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) for review and approval,
disapproval, or partial disapproval. The Magnuson Act also requires that the Secretary, upon receiving an FMP or
amendment, immediately publish a notice that the FMP or amendment is available for public review and comment. The
Secretary will consider the public comments received during the comment period in determining whether to approve
the FMP or amendment.

The Federal Election Commission is seeking comments on proposed revisions to its regulations governing publicly
financed Presidential primary and general election candidates. These regulations implement the provisions of
the Presidential Election Campaign Fund Act and the Presidential Primary Matching Payment Account Act, which establish
eligibility requirements for Presidential candidates seeking public financing and indicate how funds received
under the public financing system may be spent. They also require the Commission to audit publicly financed campaigns
and seek repayment where appropriate. The proposed rules reflect the Commission's experience in administering
this program during the 1992 election cycle and also seek to anticipate some questions that may arise during the 1996
Presidential election cycle. The Commission is requesting comments on the draft rules set out in this Notice, and
is also seeking comments on several issues for which no specific regulatory language is proposed at this time. No final
decisions have been made by the Commission on any of the proposed revisions in this Notice. Further information is
provided in the supplementary information which follows.

The Commission is considering revising parts of its regulations governing public financing of Presidential campaigns,
11 CFR Parts 9001 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
in order to more effectively administer the public financing program during the 1996 election cycle. The Commission
is publishing this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to invite comments on the proposed revisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The areas in which the Commission is considering possible revisions are described in this portion of the Notice in
narrative form. Those revisions that would affect both primary and general election campaigns are described in the
first section of the narrative. The revisions that would affect only primary or general elections, respectively,
are set out in the next two sections. The fourth section summarizes other miscellaneous and technical amendments
the Commission is proposing for the public financing rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has prepared proposed regulatory language for many of these revisions, and included this language
in the last section of the Notice. However, the Commission is also interested in receiving comments on other possible
changes for which no regulatory language has been prepared. The narrative describes these approaches and highlights
the issues to which commenters are encouraged to direct their attention. Please note that the narrative discussion
is arranged by topic, whereas the draft rules are set out in numerical order. Readers should use the citations contained
in the narrative to locate the corresponding proposed language in the draft rules.

1. Negligent Handling of Public Funds
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accounting procedures employed by the Commission make allowance for reasonable loss and normal spoilage of equipment
leased or purchased by a campaign. However, the Commission has at times encountered incidents involving the mismanagement
or negligent handling of public funds that do not fall into either of these categories. The proposed rules therefore
seek to clarify how such negligence and mismanagement is handled in the audit process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is seeking comment on whether, as a precondition for the receipt of public funds, the candidate should
agree to meet certain standards in handling public monies as well as in overseeing the use of and accounting for public
funds. Such standards would be specified at 11 CFR 9003.1(b) and 9033.1(b). If this approach is taken, the Commission
welcomes comment on what standard(s) would be appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rules would amend 11 CFR 9004.4(b) and 9034.4(b), to clarify that the cost of items that are lost or misplaced
due to negligence of a campaign committee will be considered a non-qualified expense for purposes of these rules.
However, the Commission recognizes that there are varying degrees of negligence in this area, and that certain factors
should be considered prior to any determination that a repayment is required. For example, these factors could include,
but would not be listed to, whether the committee demonstrates that it made careful efforts to safeguard the missing
equipment; the type of equipment involved; the number of items that were lost; and the value of the lost equipment as
a percentage of the total value of the equipment leased or owned by the committee. On this latter point, the Commission
notes that a lost item, such as a newly-acquired vehicle, may involve a major investment of taxpayer funds, irrespective
of the fact that its cost is only a small percentage of the total amount of equipment leased or owned by the campaign committee.
The Commission welcomes comments on other factors that should be considered in making this determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another approach would be to limit the dollar amount of lost property that could be considered a qualified campaign
expense. If a committee lost goods worth more than the specified amount, any amount over that figure would be a non-qualified
campaign expense. This would have the advantage of not requiring the Commission to get involved in what could become
a substantial number of negligence determinations, while recognizing that some loss is inevitable in large, lengthy
campaigns. The Commission welcomes comments on this approach as well as on what reimbursement limit should be specified,
if this were to be adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is also seeking comments on how lost or stolen uninsured items should be reflected on statements of
net outstanding campaign obligations [``NOCO'']. If an item is lost through negligence, the question is whether
it should continue to be treated as an asset for purposes of the NOCO statement to avoid increasing the committee's
entitlement. Comments are welcome on how this should be done.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Please note that other proposed amendments to the NOCO requirements are discussed under ``NOCO Statements,'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
infra.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A related topic, the treatment of insurance proceeds, is discussed under ``Gains on the Use of Public Funds,'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

2. Closed Captioning
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1992, Congress amended 26 U.S.C. 9003 to add a new paragraph (e), stating that no publicly funded candidate may receive
funding for either the primary or general election campaign unless the candidate agrees that all of his or her television
commercials will be closed captioned or otherwise capable of being viewed by deaf and hearing impaired individuals.
Pub. L. 102&hyph;393, section 534, 106 Stat. 1764 (1992). Although no corresponding amendment was made to 26 U.S.C.
9033, section 9003(e) states that this requirement applies not only to candidates who are eligible to receive amounts
from the Presidential Election Campaign Fund, but also to those eligible for funding ``under chapter 96'' of Title
26 of the United States Code, that is, the Presidential Primary Matching Payment Account Act. The Commission is therefore
proposing to add the statutory language to the candidate and committee agreement requirements found at both 11 CFR
9003.1(b) and 9033.1(b).

3. Media Reimbursements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 9004.6 contains rules governing expenditures for transportation and other services provided to media and
Secret Service personnel by presidential campaign committees receiving public financing for the general election.
Section 9034.6 is a parallel provision governing primary committees that receive public funds from the matching
payment account. These provisions indicate that expenditures for these purposes will, in most cases, be regarded
as qualified campaign expenses subject to the overall limitations of sections 9003.2 and 9035.1, respectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, sections 9004.6 and 9034.6 also allow committees to accept limited reimbursement for these expenses from
the media, and deduct any reimbursements received from the amount of expenditures subject to the overall expenditure
limitation. These rules set limits on the amount of reimbursement that a committee can accept, and require committees
to repay a portion of any reimbursement that exceeds those limits to the Treasury.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rules seek to clarify the application of sections 9004.6 and 9034.6 by reorganizing them without any
substantive change. Under the proposed revisions, paragraphs (a) and (b) have been broken into smaller subparagraphs.
Paragraph (c) has been renumbered as paragraph (e). Paragraph (d) has been renumbered as paragraph (c) and broken
into smaller paragraphs, and new paragraph (d) has been inserted in order to clarify the interplay between two aspects
of the existing rules: The requirement that the committee return to the media representative that portion of any reimbursement
received that exceeds the actual cost of the transportation and services provided by more than 10%, and the requirement
that the committee repay to the Treasury any part of the reimbursements it receives that exceeds the actual and administrative
costs incurred by the committee. The Commission welcomes comments on the proposed revisions to sections 9004.6 and
9034.6.

4. Travel Expenditures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission seeks comments on modifying 11 CFR 9004.7 and 9034.7 to address several issues regarding the cost of
campaign-related travel using government airplanes, helicopters and other vehicles. The current rules contemplate
that for plane flights between cities served by a regularly scheduled commercial airline service, the campaign must
reimburse the appropriate governmental entity for the first class airfare, and that this amount is treated as a qualified
campaign expense. New language in section 9004.7(b)(5)(i) and section 9034.7(b)(5)(i) would specify that, for
travel by airplane, the amount of the lowest unrestricted non-discounted first class commercial airfare available
for the time traveled is to be used. Discounted fares that are subject to restrictions on the dates and times of travel,
or restrictions on changing flights, are not comparable to the service provided when the campaign uses a government
conveyance. Campaign committees are responsible for determining these amounts at the time of the flight to ensure
that the right amount is paid to the appropriate government entity, and would need to maintain documentation supporting
these amounts. The lowest unrestricted non-discounted first class airfare is available from several sources including
travel agents and the Official Airline Guide.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Questions have also arisen regarding cities that are served by regular air service, but first class flights are not
available. In this case, the Commission proposes specifying that committees should use the lowest unrestricted
non-discounted coach fare available for the time traveled. This approach is consistent with the valuation method
established by the Select Committee on Ethics of the United States Senate for the use of private aircraft. See Interpretive
Ruling No. 412, Select Committee on Ethics, United States Senate, 101st Cong., 1st Sess., S. Prt. 101&hyph;18 at 251&hyph;52
(1989). It is also consistent with the valuation methods used by the House of Representatives' Committee on Standards
of Official Conduct with respect to gifts of private transportation not associated with official travel. See, Valuation
of Gifts of Transportation on Private Aircraft, Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, Letter dated June 11,
1987.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For cities not served by regularly scheduled commercial service, the current rules specify that the amount to be reimbursed
is the charter rate. The proposed revisions would clarify that the charter rate used should be for a comparable airplane
of similar make, model and size. This provision would also be consistent with the approaches used by the Congressional
Committees.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Questions have also arisen regarding the costs of ``positioning'' flights that are needed to bring the government
aircraft from one stop where it dropped off the candidate and campaign staff to another stop where it will pick them
up to continue the trip or return to the point of origin. New language in sections 9004.7(b)(5)(ii) and 9034.7(b)(5)(ii)
would incorporate the Commission's policy that the committee should pay the costs noted above for one passenger plus
fuel used and crew time. This approach recognizes that positioning flights are campaign-related, and therefore
these costs are properly treated as qualified campaign expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraphs (b)(5)(iii) in sections 9004.7 and 9034.7 would contain provisions regarding travel on government conveyances
other than airplanes. For travel by helicopter or ground conveyance, the commercial rental rate should be paid for
a comparable conveyance in terms of size, model and make. Additional guidance on this area can be found in Advisory
Opinion 1992&hyph;34. Proposed sections 9004.7(b)(5)(iv) and 9034.7(b)(5)(iv) would continue to require payment
for the use of accommodations paid for by a government entity. Under 11 CFR 100.7(a)(1)(iii)(B), the committee should
use the usual and normal charge in the market from which it ordinarily would have purchased the accommodations. The
term ``accommodations'' includes both lodging and meeting rooms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New paragraph (B)(8) of these sections would explicitly reflect Commission policy that travel on corporate conveyances
is governed by 11 CFR 114.9(e).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, new language in paragraph (b)(2) of these sections would provide additional guidance as to when a stop will
be considered campaign-related. Campaign activity includes soliciting, making or accepting contributions, and
expressly advocating the nomination, election or defeat of any candidate. See, e.g., AOs 1994&hyph;15, 1992&hyph;6,
and opinions cited therein. The Commission has also indicated that the absence of solicitations for contributions
or express advocacy regarding candidates will not preclude a determination that an activity is ``campaign related.''

Id.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Accordingly, the proposed rules would include other factors to be considered in determining whether a stop is campaign-related.
The rules would also retain the current language indicating that incidental campaign-related contacts during an
otherwise noncampaign-related stop would not cause the stop to be considered campaign-related.

5. Winding Down Costs; Gifts and Bonuses
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current regulations at 11 CFR 9004.4(a)(4)(i) and 9034.4(a)(3)(i) permit candidates to receive contributions
and matching funds, and make disbursements, for the purpose of defraying winding down costs over an extended period
after the candidate's date of ineligibility [``DOI'']. These amounts are treated as qualified campaign expenses,
and can result in additional audit fieldwork and preparation of addenda to audit reports to focus on these receipts
and disbursements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is proposing several ways to streamline and shorten the audit process, discussed below. In addition,
comments are welcome on whether the amount that a candidate may receive for winding down costs should be limited to
no more than a flat dollar amount, or a set percentage of the candidate's total expenditures during the campaign, or
a set percentage of total matching funds certified for the candidate. If so, what should the amount or percentage be?
If campaigns receive a set dollar amount, but do not use the entire amount for winding down costs, should they be permitted
to retain the unspent amount? Allowing them to keep the remainder would serve as an incentive to complete the winding
down process promptly. However, there are public policy reasons for requiring the remaining funds to be returned
to the U.S. Treasury. Placing a cap on winding down expenses would assist the Commission's goal of streamlining, but
the amount chosen would have to be sufficient to meet reasonable expenses incurred in winding down the campaign. Another
option would be to establish a cutoff date after which winding down expenses would not longer be considered qualified
campaign expenses. Other suggestions that would simplify and shorten the required audit process are encouraged.
The proposed rules do not include language regarding these proposals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission seeks comments on new language in section 9034.4(A) incorporating the current practice of permitting
publicly-funded primary committees to treat 100% of salary, overhead and computer expenses incurred after the candidate's
date of ineligibility (DOI) as exempt compliance expenses, beginning with the first full reporting period after
DOI. See, Financial Control and Compliance Manual for Presidential Primary Candidates Receiving Public Financing,
p. 25 (January, 1992). Please note that this approach does not apply to expenses incurred during the period between
DOI and the date on which a candidate either re-establishes eligibility or ceases to continue to campaign. Similarly,
for general election candidates, new language would be added to section 9004.4(a) to allow 100% of salary and overhead
expenses incurred after the end of the expenditure report period to be paid from the legal and accounting compliance
fund, provided these expenses are solely to ensure compliance with the FECA and the Fund Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, new language in sections 9004.4(a) and 9034.4(a) would permit campaign committees to use federal funds
to defray the costs of gifts or monetary bonuses for committee staff and consultants, as long as the gifts do not exceed
$150 per individual and as long as all gifts and bonuses (except bonuses provided for at the outset in employment and
consulting contracts) are limited to $20,000. This approach is somewhat similar to a provision included in the public
funding rules for convention committees at 11 CFR 9008.7(a)(4)(xii). See 59 FR 33618 (June 29, 1994). With regard
to bonus arrangements provided for in advance in employment and consulting contracts, comments are sought on whether
the amount of these bonuses should be restricted to a fixed percentage of the compensation paid as provided by the contract,
or whether these bonuses should be subject to the overall $20,000 limit. Such an approach would be intended to ensure
that committees do not give out sizable bonuses simply because they have surplus public funds at the end of the campaign.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 9003.5(b)(1)(i) and 9033.11(b)(1)(i) set forth the documentation required for disbursements in excess
of $200. Although a canceled check, negotiated by the payee, is required in most situations, it is not currently required
if the committee presents a receipted bill from the payee stating the purpose of the disbursement. The proposed rules
would change the documentation requirements so that committees must provide canceled checks negotiated by the payees
for all disbursements over $200. This change would assist the Commission's audit staff in verifying that public funds
are spent on qualified campaign expenses. Committees should already have canceled checks in their possession, so
production would not be burdensome. Please note that, as in the past, the proposed rules would require that documentation
in addition to the committee's check be provided for disbursements exceeding $200.

2. Alphabetized Schedules
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rules include two new sections, 11 CFR 9006.3 and 9037.4, which would require that presidential campaign
committee reports containing schedules generated from computerized files, list in alphabetical order the sources
of the receipts, the payees and creditors. For individuals, including contributors, the list must be in alphabetical
order by surname. However, presidential campaign committees would not be required to computerize their records
if they do not wish to do so. The new provision is intended to remedy situations in which committees maintain computerized
records of contributors or payees in alphabetical order, but file schedules with the order of the names scrambled.
That practice makes it very difficult, if not impossible, to locate particular names on the committee's reports if
the schedules are voluminous, thereby thwarting the public disclosure purposes of the Federal Election Campaign
Act, 2 U.S.C. 431

1. Sampling and Disgorgement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has a statutory obligation to complete the audits of publicly funded committees in a thorough and timely
manner. In the past, the resources required to conduct reviews of the contributions received by presidential committees
contributed to the Commission's difficulty in fulfilling that obligation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Beginning with the 1992 election cycle, however, the Commission began to make more extensive use of statistical sampling
for audits of contributions received by publicly financed presidential primary election committees, and to use
the sample results to quantify, in whole or in part, the dollar value of any related audit findings. While the Commission
continues to conduct a limited non-sample review of contributions received by these committees, most audit testing
of contributions and supporting documentation is now done on a sample basis. The Commission is now proposing that
new paragraph (f) be added to 11 CFR 9007.1 and 9038.1 to incorporate these procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission notes that this approach would apply in a general election only to contributions raised due to a deficiency
in the Presidential Election Campaign Fund, or to contributions raised by new or minor party candidates. See 26 U.S.C.
9003(c)(2), 9006(c); 11 CFR 9003.2(b)(2), 9003.3(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of statistical sampling is legally acceptable for projecting certain components of a large universe, such
as excessive and prohibited contributions.

The statistical sampling technique currently employed in this process, known as Dollar Unit Sampling, Probability
Proportional to Size, or Combined Attribute Variable Sampling, is widely accepted in the auditing profession. This
plan is discussed in the American Institute of Certified Public Accounts' Audit and Accounting Guide entitled Audit
Sampling, and is the only sampling plan capable of producing dollar projections supported by the audit software package
IDEA, which is marketed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. This same technique has been used
by the Commission since 1980 to determine the amount of committees' matching fund payments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is using this sampling plan to evaluate committees' compliance with contribution prohibitions and
limitations, itemization of contributions, omission of disclosure information and receipts documentation. See
2 U.S.C. 432(c), 434(b), 441a, 441b, 441c, 441e, 441g. For example, the Commission projects the total amount of excessive
or prohibited contributions based on apparent excessive or prohibited contributions identified in a sample of a
committee's contributions. This projection becomes the basis, in whole or in part, of the audit finding.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission informs the committee which items serve as the basis for the sample, and the committee responds only
to the specific sample items used to make the projection. If the committee shows that any errors found among the sample
items were not excessive or prohibited contributions, timely refunded, reattributed or redesignated, or for some
other reason were not errors, a new projection is made, based on the reduced number of errors in the sample.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is further proposing to clarify at new paragraphs 9007.1(f)(3) and 9038.1(f)(3) that the amount of
any excessive or prohibited contributions that are not refunded, reattributed or redesignated in a timely manner
shall be paid to the United States Treasury. Committees have 30 days from the date of receipt in which to refund prohibited
contributions, and 60 days in which to seek the reattribution, redesignation or refund of excessive contributions.
11 CFR 103.3(b) (1), (2) and (3). A committee's failure to take action on these contributions, as well as attempts to
cure them outside of the specified time periods, would cause these contributions to be treated as in violation of the
FECA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, this proposed payment is analogous to, and consistent with, the requirement at 11 CFR 9038.6 that stale-dated
checks be paid to the Treasury. This issue arose after the 1984 election cycle, and the rule was promulgated as a means
to codify the Commission practice of requiring disgorgement, which was implemented during that cycle. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See, e.g.,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Disgorgement eliminates the need for the Commission to monitor a committee's refunds of excessive or prohibited
contributions. In addition, it is easier for a committee to make one payment to the Treasury, as opposed to refunding
multiple contributions. Finally, this is a practical approach in those situations where it is difficult to discern
the original contributors.

2. Further Streamlining the Audit Process
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is seeking comments and suggestions on ways to further reduce the amount of time it takes to audit publicly
funded presidential committees, to make repayment determinations, and to complete the enforcement process for
these committees. The Commission's responsibility for conducting a thorough audit and examination of qualified
campaign expenses is set out at 26 U.S.C. 9007(a) and 9038(a). The Commission has an additional responsibility to
conduct adjudications as to whether any portion of the public funds received should be subject to a repayment. 26 U.S.C.
9007(b) and 9038(b). The public financing statutes at 26 U.S.C. 9007(c) and 9038(c) specify a three year time period
in which the Commission will notify publicly funded committees of repayment determinations. Separate enforcement
procedures are prescribed under 2 U.S.C. 437g.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has taken several actions to help insure that the audit and repayment processes are completed as expeditiously
as possible. For example, the 1991 revisions to the public financing regulations eased compliance with the state-by-state
allocation rules set forth at 11 CFR 106.2, and implemented improved use of subpoenas in presidential audits. See
56 FR 35899&hyph;900, 35903&hyph;04 (July 29, 1991). In addition, as noted above, the Commission has begun to use
generally accepted sampling procedures in conducting these audits, and has instituted a policy that limits a committee
to one extension of time in which to respond to the Interim and Final Audit Reports [``IAR'' and ``FAR'']. These actions
are having the desired effect, in that the Commission is currently on schedule, or ahead of schedule, with respect
to nearly all 1992 audits.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Given this situation, one approach would be to wait until after the new rules and procedures have been in place for an
entire presidential election cycle before evaluating what additional streamlining methods are warranted, if any.
In the alternative, the Commission welcomes suggestions for further streamlining these processes, and seeks comments
on several possible changes that are explained below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission notes that it is important to ensure that whatever streamlining measures are adopted do not adversely
affect the statutorily required audit process, the committees' due process rights when repayment determinations
are made, or the Commission's ability to effectively conduct subsequent enforcement actions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As for modifications to the actual audit and repayment processes, the Commission is first considering whether the
committee's oral presentation should be held at an earlier point. Currently a committee may request the opportunity
to make an oral presentation if the committee submits written materials disputing the initial repayment determination
contained in the FAR. 11 CFR 9007.2(c)(3), 9038.2(c)(3). Please note that the Commission is not considering adding
a second hearing to the audit and repayment processes, but only whether the current hearing should be held at a different
point.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission recognizes that some committees might prefer to make this presentation earlier in the process. Moving
up the hearing could also help the Commission resolve issues at an earlier date. However, it is unclear whether advancing
the hearing would in and of itself shorten either the audit or repayment process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission's experience has been that many issues are resolved or narrowed as the audit progresses and the amount
of the repayment is further refined. Hence, an earlier date could result in a longer, less manageable hearing on more
issues. To date, the Commission has averaged only five oral hearings per cycle, because sufficient issues were resolved
in or before the FAR in the other audits to make a hearing unnecessary. The earlier in the process a hearing is held, the
more likely it is that a committee will request one. This approach could thus slow down, rather than speed up, the audit
process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission also seeks comments on whether to shorten the time between various stages of the audit, repayment,
and enforcement processes, or to eliminate some of these stages. For example, the IAR currently includes a preliminary
repayment calculation, while the FAR includes an initial repayment determination. 11 CFR 9007.1(c), (d); 9038.1(c),
(d). The Commission issues the final repayment determination following consideration of the initial repayment
determination in the FAR, along with, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 information contained in the committee's written response or presented at the hearing, if one is held. 11 CFR 9007.2(c)(4),
9038.2(c)(4).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One alternative would be to include the initial repayment determination in the IAR, and include the final repayment
determination and statement of reasons in the FAR. The committee would then respond to the IAR with a written statement
and could request the opportunity to make an oral presentation, as is now done following the FAR. This hearing and related
documentation would serve as the basis for the FAR.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The committee would continue to have the right to petition for a rehearing, in accordance with 11 CFR 9007.5 and 9038.5,
but would exercise this right following the FAR/final repayment determination, rather than after the later, separately-issued
final repayment determination that occurs under the present rules. Please note that including the initial repayment
determination in the IAR would not change the rule that issuance of an IAR serves as notification of repayment determinations.
See 11 CFR 9007.2(a)(2) and 9038.2(a)(2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A variation of this approach would be to provide a staff draft of the IAR to the committee at the same time it is sent to
the Commission, much in the manner that the Commission currently provides a probable cause to believe brief to respondents
pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 437g(a)(3). The committee could provide a written response to the staff-prepared IAR and request
a hearing before the Commission. The hearing and additional materials submitted would serve as the basis for the Commission's
adoption of the FAR. The Commission would subsequently issue the final repayment determination and statement of
reasons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While this approach could take less time, committees might prefer to know when they are preparing their responses
whether the Commission agrees with the staff's analysis of the issues presented. This would not be possible if the
committee received the staff draft of the IAR at the same time it was sent to the Commission. Also, the staff draft could
not contain an interim repayment determination, as that must be approved by the Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is also concerned with how confidentiality requirements could impact on these proposed revisions.
When committee activities raise both repayment and enforcement issues, the current confidentiality provisions
require that matters already determined by the Commission to warrant enforcement action not be made public during
the Commission's discussion of the initial repayment determination. For example, the publicly released FAR does
not discuss the referral of specific matters for enforcement under 2 U.S.C. 437g. See 11 CFR 9007.1(e)(2), 9038.1(e)(2).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Regardless of what other changes might be made, the Commission is considering whether the IAR should be made public
at the time it is sent to the committee. If this were done, the Commission's ``sunshine'' rules might require a public
discussion of the IAR, unless the document met other criteria requiring closed discussion under 11 CFR 2.4.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission recognizes that committees may prefer that the preliminary repayment calculation, which is now contained
in the IAR, not be publicly released, because the amount of the requested repayment may be substantially altered prior
to the issuance of the FAR or the final repayment determination. On the other hand, publicly releasing the IAR could
encourage committees to address issues at an earlier point, rather than waiting until the later stages of the audit
and repayment processes, as now sometimes occurs. If the decision is made to release the IAR, the revised rules would
note that the repayment sought could be adjusted upwards or downwards, based on any subsequent information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Commission is considering whether, in those audits that lead to enforcement actions, the enforcement
process should begin at an earlier point, such as by making reason to believe findings when the IAR is issued. This would
permit the investigation to proceed concurrently with the audit and repayment processes, so that the final repayment
determination and statement of reasons could be issued when the enforcement matter is concluded.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission already has begun to initiate enforcement actions at an earlier point, in appropriate cases. However,
it may prove difficult, if not impossible, to formulate a specific policy that would apply equitably to all audits
as to when the enforcement process should begin and when it should be completed. The Commission would not want the completion
of the audit and repayment processes to be delayed because the enforcement action is still underway. Also, in some
situations, it may not be possible for the Commission to open an enforcement matter before it issues a final repayment
determination, if that determination constitutes the Commission's earliest analysis of whether certain actions
may constitute violations. Thus the current case-by-case approach may prove to be the best alternative.

3. Administrative Record
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission also has prepared new sections 9007.7 and 9038.7 to explain which documents constitute the administrative
record for purposes of judicial review of final determinations regarding candidate certification, eligibility,
ineligibility, and repayment. For example, the administrative record includes documents and other supporting
evidence on which the Commission's decision is based such as the candidate agreement, matching fund submissions,
Interim Audit Report, NOCO statement, the Final Audit Report, transcript of the committee's oral presentation,
the final repayment determination, statements of reasons, and the certifications of Commission votes. On the other
hand, the Commission has never considered the administrative record to include documents in the files of individual
Commissioners, or documents in FEC employees' files which do not constitute a basis for the Commission's decisions.
It would also not be appropriate to include in the administrative record transcripts or tapes of Commission discussions
of audit or repayment matters. Although these materials may sometimes be made available under the Freedom of Information
and Government in the Sunshine Acts, they do not provide an adequate explanation of the reasons for the Commission's
decisions because they represent pre-decisional discussions. Documents properly subject to privileges such as
an attorney-client privilege, or items constituting attorney work product, would also not be made part of the administrative
record. The Commission welcomes comments regarding the types of documents and materials that should or should not
be considered part of the administrative record.

 [``DCA''], at section 3716, authorizes the practice of administrative offset, whereby amounts owed to the Government
may be deducted from amounts due from the Government to a debtor if certain requirements are met. This means, for example,
that the Commission could obtain repayments from certain publicly funded campaigns that have failed to make timely
restitution of improperly-utilized public funds, if that candidate qualified for public funding in a future election
cycle.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One of the DCA's requirements is that, before an agency can utilize this procedure, it must have prescribed regulations
describing how this will be done. However, the DCA has other ramifications both for public funding, and for the Commission's
enforcement process under the FECA. For example, in some situations, section 3717 of the DCA would require charging
interest, penalties and processing and handling costs on overdue debts. This could include both overdue repayments
and overdue civil penalties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has an ongoing rulemaking that would revise various FECA enforcement procedures, and is planning
to publish an additional Notice in connection with that rulemaking to seek comments on how the DCA might be utilized
in both the FECA and the public funding context. Comments received in response to that Notice will serve as the basis
for deciding whether to amend the public funding rules to provide for administrative offset, interest and other charges.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is also seeking comment on the related question of whether, absent implementation of the DCA, it would
be appropriate to assess interest on late repayments (those made after 90 days following notice of the Commission's
repayment determination) and during extensions of time on repayment determinations, especially those that exceed
the 90-day period established at 11 CFR 9007.2(d)(1) and 9038.2(d)(1).

In the absence of charges for delinquent payments, debtors have little or no incentive to make timely payments. Without
this requirement, debtors may be more likely to pay their private sector debts first, as these generally accrue interest,
and their government debts last.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has already established the precedent that it may assess interest when a presidential committee seeks
a stay of a repayment determination pending appeal. 11 CFR 9007.5(c)(4), 9038.5(c)(4). One reason cited by the Commission
for taking this action was to protect the Treasury ``by helping to ensure that the repayment challenge is a serious
one and not a dilatory tactic.'' Agenda Document

Another argument in support of collecting interest is that, by agreeing to certain conditions, including an audit
and appropriate repayment, the presidential committees have established a contractual relationship with the Commission
under which interest assessment becomes appropriate.

 183 F.2d 998, 999 (D.C. Cir. 1950). Such a relationship exists in this context in that, prior to the receipt of public
funds, the candidate must agree to repay unexpended funds, money determined to be spent in an unqualified manner,
and amounts received in excess of entitlement. 11 CFR 9003.1(b)(6), 9033.1(b)(7).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the Commission decides to expand the current interest assessment policy, it would seem appropriate that the same
interest computation formula be utilized across the board. Under current 11 CFR 9007.5(c)(4) and 9038.5(c)(4),
the interest assessed is the greater of that calculated using the formula set forth at 28 U.S.C. 1961 (a) and (b) for
computing interest on money judgments in federal civil cases, or the amount actually earned on the set-aside funds
in controversy. The Commission welcomes comments on whether this or some other approach should be taken, should additional
regulations be promulgated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Treasurers of political committees, including authorized committees of Presidential candidates, are required
by 2 U.S.C. 432(i) and 434(b) to use their best efforts to obtain, maintain and report the name, address, occupation
and employer of all contributors who give over $200 per calendar year. The Commission recently issued revised rules
regarding this reporting obligation. See 58 FR 57725 (Oct. 27, 1993). During that rulemaking, two commenters suggested
revising 11 CFR 9036.2 so that Presidential primary candidates would only receive matching funds for contributions
exceeding $200 containing complete contributor information. While full contributor identifications are required
for such contributions in threshold submissions under 11 CFR 9036.1(b), they are not currently required under 11
CFR 9036.2(b)(1)(v) for additional submissions for matching funds. Accordingly, comments are requested on whether
to delete section 9036.2(b)(1)(v), thereby requiring complete contributor information for all matchable contributions
exceeding $200. In the alternative, comments are sought on only matching these contributions if committees can provide
evidence demonstrating they made their best efforts to obtain the information. Please note that neither of these
alternatives is included in the proposed regulations which follow.

2. NOCO Statements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 9034.5(a) of the regulations requires the candidate to submit a statement of net outstanding campaign obligations
[``NOCO''] within 15 days of his or her date of ineligibility. Section 9034.5(f)(1) also requires the candidate to
submit a revised statement of net outstanding campaign obligations with each subsequent matching payment request.
These NOCO statements provide the Commission with an indication of the campaign's financial status. The Commission
uses these statements to determine whether the candidate is entitled to receive any additional matching funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In some circumstances, the NOCO statements do not provide adequate information about the candidate's remaining
obligations. For example, many NOCO statements list the candidate's estimated necessary winding down costs as a
single lump sum, making it difficult for the Commission to review the cost estimate to determine whether the candidate
is entitled to receive the entire estimated amount. In addition, because several weeks now elapse between submission
of the NOCO statement and certification of the matching payments due to changes in the Treasury Department's payment
policy, the certification often does not reflect the true financial status of the committee at the time of certification.
The candidate's financial situation invariably changes during this period, and any change in the committee's net
outstanding campaign obligations should result in a change in the committee's entitlement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule seeks to address these problems. Section 9034.5(b) would be amended to require a breakdown of the
estimated winding down costs listed on the NOCO statement by category and time period. This breakdown would include
estimates of quarterly or monthly costs for office space rental, staff salaries, office supplies, equipment rental,
telephone expenses, postage and other mailing costs, printing, and storage from the date of the NOCO statement until
the expected termination of the committee's political activity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would also require a candidate who submits a matching payment request and accompanying NOCO statement
after his or her date of ineligibility to submit an additional revised NOCO statement. This statement would be due
just before the certification date, on a date that would be published by the Commission with the dates for matching
fund submissions and matching payment certifications. The candidate would be required to prepare the statement
so that it reflects the financial status of the campaign three business days before the statement's due date. The Commission
would then use this statement to determine whether the amount of matching payments to be certified should be adjusted
to reflect a committee's changed financial situation. This would ensure that the amount certified accurately reflects
the committee's financial situation at the time of certification. The Commission welcomes comments on these proposed
rules.

B. Qualified Campaign Expenses
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Funding General Election Expenses with Primary Funds
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Presidential Election Campaign Fund Act, the Presidential Primary Matching Payment Account Act, and Commission
regulations require that publicly funded presidential candidates use primary election funds only for expenses
incurred in connection with primary elections, and that they use general election funds only for general election
expenses. 26 U.S.C. 9002(11), 9032(9); 11 CFR 9002.11, 9032.9. These requirements are tied to the overall primary
and general election expenditure limits set forth at 2 U.S.C. 441a (b) and (c), and at 26 U.S.C. 9004(b) and 9034(b).
See also 11 CFR 9004.1, 9004.3(b), 9034.1(d). Therefore, once a primary candidate is the clear and projected winner
of the primary election process and begins to campaign by addressing issues and comparability with other projected
general election candidates, certain costs incurred prior to the candidate's primary election date of ineligibility
are considered general election expenses that are reimbursable by the general election committee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is seeking comments on whether the pertinent rules should provide more specific guidance on how certain
expenditures might be characterized. Questions have arisen in recent election cycles as to whether certain primary
funding was in fact used to benefit the general election. As additional states choose to hold their state nominating
conventions or primary elections early in the election cycle, the major parties' selection of a nominee is increasingly
likely to be decided long before the convention. Once a candidate has secured enough delegates to win the nomination,
the focus of the campaign may turn in large part to the general election. However, the Commission realizes that it can
be difficult to distinguish between legitimate primary campaign activity, such as that which is designed to lock
up delegates, or is related to the primary outcomes or pre-convention preparation, from activity that is geared towards
the general election.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is considering several alternatives that would provide additional guidance to presidential campaign
committees on how such expenditures are treated. The Commission welcomes comments on any of these approaches, as
well as suggestions on other ways available to deal with this situation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One question concerns depreciation of primary committee assets in this situation. Section 9034.5(c)(1) currently
permits a standard 40% depreciation of capital assets held by a primary campaign committee, except for items acquired
after the committee's DOI. A higher depreciation is allowed for a particular item if the committee demonstrates through
documentation that the asset's fair market value is lower.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under certain circumstances, however, the 40% figure may be overly generous. For example, if the primary committee
purchases a $20,000 computer system shortly before the primary election DOI and then sells it to the general election
committee, allowing the primary campaign to assume a 40% depreciation would result in a nearly $8,000 subsidy from
the primary to the general election committee. The Commission is therefore proposing that paragraph 9034.5(c)(1)
be amended to clarify that a higher, lower, or no depreciation may be claimed in appropriate cases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current 11 CFR 9034.4(b)(3) states that expenses incurred after a candidate's primary election DOI are not considered
qualified campaign expenses, except for certain winding down costs and costs incurred in continuing to campaign.
See 11 CFR 9034.4(a)(3). The Commission is considering whether this language should be expanded to clarify that,
consistent with 26 U.S.C. 9002(11)(B) and 11 CFR 9002.11(b), goods received prior to the DOI that are used for the general
election, and pre-DOI services that provide a benefit to the general election campaign, are considered qualified
campaign expenses for the general election and not for the primary election.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One approach would be to allocate the cost of each capital asset between the primary and the general election, based
on when the asset was acquired and the time the committee began to focus on the general election. This could be difficult
to administer, however, requiring as it would an asset-by-asset determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another approach would be to include a presumption in section 9034.4(b)(3) that capital assets purchased during
a certain period before the first day of the candidate's party's national nominating convention are general election
assets. Section 9034.4(b)(3) of the proposed rules would set a presumed cutoff date of 60 days before the start of the
candidate's party's national nominating convention. However, the Commission is requesting comments on whether
some other cutoff point would better serve this purpose, as well as whether a uniform cutoff date, such as June 15 preceding
the national nominating convention, would be more appropriate. If so, what date should be selected? If a more flexible
approach is desirable, how should the applicable timeframe be computed? Should it be the date of the candidate's party's
last state primary election?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whatever approach is adopted, the presumption would be rebuttable based on each candidate's particular circumstances.
If a candidate could demonstrate that he or she was still largely involved in campaigning for the nomination after
the presumptive cutoff date, that date could be moved back. In the case of a brokered convention, several candidates
might be found to have focused nearly exclusively on securing the nomination until the date during the convention
on which one in fact did so. Conversely, a candidate who became the clear and projected nominee of a party early in the
presidential election year might be found to have made expenditures in connection with the general election well
in advance of the designated cutoff date.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In determining how expenditures made as of a certain date should be characterized, the Commission might consider
such information as how many delegates the candidate has, the number of candidates who received votes in each of the
candidate's party's most recent state primary elections or other state nominating procedures, the relative percentages
received by each candidate in these proceedings, and whether the candidate had begun to focus on issues raised by other
projected general election candidates and his or her comparability with such candidates. The Commission welcomes
suggestions of other factors that could prove helpful in making this determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another question involves local campaign offices that continue to operate after a state's primary election or other
nominating procedure is over, when the office is no longer focused on securing the nomination in that state. The Commission
is proposing a rebuttable presumption that a local campaign office that remains open more than 30 days after a state's
primary election, or the close of any other nomination process in that state, is operating in support of the general
election campaign. The Commission welcomes comments on this approach, as well as suggestions for others that would
result in a fair attribution of these expenditures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This situation becomes more complicated when applied to supplies and materials. The Commission is therefore seeking
comments on how such items should be treated. One approach would be to require an inventory of everything on hand, including
campaign materials but perhaps excluding items below a certain threshold amount, as of the DOI. These items would
then be sold to the general election at cost. If there was no inventory, everything purchased or delivered in the last
60 days before the DOI would be presumed to be a general election expense. The Commission notes that this approach could
be difficult to verify, since the inventory would be at a point in time which could not be recreated. Nevertheless,
it is important that primary election funds not be used to subsidize the general election.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Commission welcomes comments on how other foods and/or services, such as campaign-related travel and
media expenses, should be treated in this context. For example, if a candidate travels to a state where the primary
has already been held, some of the travel could be for fundraising to help obtain the nomination, but some or all might
be for general election purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this NPRM is intended to revise the Commission's ``continuing to campaign'' rules set forth at 11 CFR 9034.4(a)(3)(ii).
These rules allow a candidate who is no longer eligible for matching funds but is still seeking the nomination to use
post-DOI contributions to pursue his or her primary campaign_a different situation than that addressed in this proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission recognizes that, under unusual circumstances, a candidate who appears to have been eliminated early
in the election cycle may later secure the nomination. As is currently true, these special situations would be evaluated
on a case-by-case basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conversely, a candidate who appears to have secured the nomination early in the campaign may in fact fail to obtain
it, and thus not qualify for general election funding. The Commission is less concerned with this possibility, as
the focus of this portion of the rulemaking is on how certain expenditures should be treated by those candidates who
go on to become the convention's nominee.

2. Convention Expenses of Ineligible Candidates
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is seeking comments on whether expenses incurred by losing primary election candidates in attending
their party's national nominating convention should be considered a qualified campaign expense under 11 CFR 9032.9.
Such attendance could provide a defeated candidate the opportunity to continue to fundraise, perhaps to campaign
for the vice presidential nomination, and to maintain contact with his or her pledged convention delegates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission notes, however, that qualified campaign expenses are defined in the Presidential Primary Matching
Payment Account Act at 26 U.S.C. 9032(9)(A) as those ``incurred by a candidate, or by his authorized committee, in
connection with his campaign for nomination for election.'' This definition seemingly does not apply to those no
longer seeking the presidential nomination. Also, the term ``candidate'' is defined as ``an individual who seeks
nomination for election to be President of the United States,'' and thus does not on its face include those seeking
the vice presidential nomination. 26 U.S.C. 9032(2). Further, in recent years presidential candidates have increasingly
announced their vice presidential selections in advance (at times well in advance) of the national convention. Finally,
under 11 CFR 9034.1(b), candidates can already count fundraising expenses incurred following their Date of Ineligibility
(DOI), including those incurred at a national nominating convention, as qualified campaign expenses.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is also concerned about potential practical problems with this approach. For example, if a candidate's
DOI occurs early in the election cycle, there will be a substantial gap between the DOI and the date of the convention.
The purpose of the 10% rule (26 U.S.C. 9033(c)(1)(B); 11 CFR 9033.5(b)), under which a candidate becomes ineligible
for additional funding on the 30th day following the date of the second consecutive primary election in which he or
she receives less than 10% of the popular vote, is to discontinue funding of candidates who have not received substantial
support following their initial establishment of eligibility. See 122 Congressional Record S.3787 (daily ed. March
18, 1976) (remarks of Sen. Taft).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A related concern is that, under these circumstances, the Commission may be well along in the audit of a candidate's
campaign by the time the convention opens. Providing an additional matching fund period to such candidates could
substantially complicate the audit process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If this approach were to be adopted, the Commission welcomes comments on who should be covered by the new provision,
and during what timeframe it should apply. Should this be limited to expenses incurred by the candidate, or the candidate
and his or her immediate family, or should it also include campaign staff? If the latter, should such staff be limited,
either by number or position held in the campaign? The Commission notes that, where a number of candidates sought the
nomination, the expenses of these candidates, their families, and accompanying campaign staff could be substantial.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Please note that the draft rules that follow do not include any specific regulatory language on this point.

1. Calculation of Repayment Ratio
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 9038.2(b)(2), committees are required to repay amounts received from the matching payment account
that are used for non-qualified campaign expenses. The amount of any repayment sought under section 9038.2(b)(2)
bears the same ratio to the total amount of non-qualified campaign expenses as the amount of matching funds certified
to the candidate bears to the candidate's total deposits, as of the candidate's date of ineligibility. Repayment
determinations under this section include all non-qualified campaign expenses paid between the committee's date
of inception and the point when committee accounts no longer contain matching funds. Thus, the repayment amount is
calculated by multiplying the total non-qualified campaign expenses by the repayment ratio, as determined on the
candidate's date of ineligibility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, this section does not serve its intended purpose when applied to a candidate that receives a significant
amount of matching payments after his or her date of ineligibility. Section 9038.2(b)(2) does not take into account
private contributions received by the candidate after his or her date of ineligibility. Consequently, when this
section is applied to a candidate that receives a significant amount of private contributions after that date, it
generates a repayment amount that does not accurately reflect the ratio of matching payments to private contributions
actually received by that candidate during the courts of the campaign.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, section 9038.2(b)(2) is inconsistent with the statute when applied to a candidate who does not receive
matching payments until after his or her date of ineligibility. Section 9038(b)(2) of the Matching Payment Account
Act requires a candidate who uses public funds for non-qualified campaign expenses to repay a portion of the public
funds he or she received to the Treasury. However, when section 9038.2(b)(2) of the regulations is applied to a candidate
who does not receive matching payments until after his or her date of ineligibility, the rule arguably generates a
repayment ratio of zero even if the candidate incurred numerous non-qualified campaign expenses. Thus, under the
regulations, the candidate would not be required to repay any of those funds, even though the statute specifically
requires repayment in this situation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 9038.2(b)(2)(iii) of the proposed rules contains two proposed revisions that would address these situations.
The first proposal would change the date for determining the candidate's repayment ratio from the date of ineligibility
to 90 days after the date of ineligibility. A ratio determined on the later date would take into account most of the post-DOI
private contributions received by the candidate. As a result, the ratio will more accurately reflect the amount of
matching payments and private contributions actually received. This approach would also produce an accurate repayment
ratio and repayment amount for those candidates that do not receive any matching payments until after their date of
ineligibility. As a result, this proposed revision would address both of the situations described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second proposal, which is set out in paragraph (A) of this section, would take a narrower approach. Under this proposal,
the Commission would treat all matching funds certified in response to matching payment submissions received as
of the candidate's date of ineligibility as though they were certified as of the candidate's date of ineligibility.
Treating these funds as though they were certified pre-DOI would allow the Commission to use these funds to calculate
the repayment ratio, resulting in a ratio of an amount greater than zero that reflects the mix of public funds and private
contributions actually received. The Commission could then use this ratio to determine the amount that the candidate
is required to repay under section 9038(b)(2) of the statute.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission welcomes comments on which approach would be preferable. Please note that, if the first approach is
adopted, paragraph (A) will be unnecessary, and therefore will not be included in the final rules. If paragraph (A)
is adopted, the candidate's repayment ratio will continue to be determined as of the candidate's date of ineligibility,
as it is under the current rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In an effort to improve clarity, the proposed rules would also break this section down in to separate paragraphs. The
Commission welcomes comments on the proposed changes to section 9038.2(b)(2).

1. Commission Actions Following Part 9039 Investigations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission's review and investigatory authority for administering the matching fund program is set forth at
26 U.S.C. 9039(b). In carrying out these responsibilities, the Commission must perform a continuing review of candidate
and committee reports and submissions, and other relevant information. The implementing regulations are found
at 11 CFR part 9039.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the most part the Commission's review is routine, carried out in accordance with the eligibility, audit and repayment
procedures contained elsewhere in the regulations. 26 U.S.C. 9039(b) and its implementing regulations provide
authority to conduct audits and investigations outside of the audits required under 26 U.S.C. 9038 and 11 CFR part
9038. Most of these cases have involved issues relating to a candidate's continuing eligibility or the amount of his
or her entitlement during the course of the campaign, although they could also involve a post-election inquiry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 9039.3 of the regulations describes how examinations, audits and investigations are conducted in these
inquiries. The Commission is considering whether to provide in the final rules a fuller explanation of actions that
may be taken at the conclusion of any such action. Please note that there is no specific language in the text of the proposed
rules on this point.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this approach, if the Commission decided to take no further action in a 9039 case, the candidate(s) and committee(s)
involved would be so notified. If the Commission decided that there was a sufficient basis to take further action,
such action would follow as closely as possible the procedures already in place for comparable situations. See e.g.,
11 CFR 9033.10. For example, a post election inquiry could lead to either an additional repayment determination,
in which case the procedures set forth at 11 CFR 9038.2 for making and challenging repayment determinations would
apply, or a 2 U.S.C. 437g enforcement action.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 1, 1994, the Commission received a Petition for Rulemaking from the Center for Responsive Politics requesting
that the Commission repeal its rules providing for the use of privately-financed general election legal and accounting
compliance funds [``GELAC''] in Presidential campaigns. Specifically, the petitioner seeks repeal of 11 CFR 100.8(b)(15)
(last two sentences), 106.2(b)(2)(iii) (last sentence), 9002.11(b)(5), 9003.3(a), and 9035.1(c)(1). The petition
argues that the Commission's rules undermine the ability of the public financing laws to achieve the objective of
reducing the influence of large contributions in Presidential elections. It charges that these regulations permit
evasion of the prohibition on accepting contributions to defray qualified campaign expenses established by the
Presidential Election Campaign Fund Act. 26 U.S.C. 9003(b). Furthermore, the petition claims that the Commission's
regulations violate the spending limits established by the FECA. 2 U.S.C. 441a.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 30, 1994, the Commission published a Notice of Availability seeking statements in support of or in opposition
to the petition. 59 FR 14794 (March 30, 1994). In response to the Notice, four statements have been received from the
Internal Revenue Service, Public Citizen, Common Cause, and a joint comment from the Democratic National Committee
and the Republican National Committee. Two were supportive while one opposed the reversal of the Commission's long
standing policies regarding legal and accounting costs. The Internal Revenue Service found no conflict with the
Internal Code or the Regulations thereunder.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is continuing to consider the petition as part of this rulemaking and seeks further comment on abolishing
the GELAC. The Commission is also seeking evidence either supporting or refuting the petitioner's claim that the
privately-funded GELAC undermines the public financing of general election campaigns by allowing the actuality
and the appearance of improper influence in Presidential elections. Absent evidence supporting the petitioner's
claim, the Commission would be reluctant to completely eliminate the GELAC because Presidential campaigns would
need to devote some of their public funds for compliance expenses, instead of using public moneys for campaign expenses.
The result could be significant difficulty in complying with the public financing statutes and the FECA. The GELAC
is also used to make repayments, which would need to be funded from other sources. Moreover, the elimination of monetary
contributions of $1000 or less for compliance purposes could force some committees to turn to much larger in-kind
donation of legal and accounting services to ensure that their compliance obligations are satisfied. See 2 U.S.C.
431(8)(B)(ix) and (9)(B)(vii).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, comments are requested on several alternative revisions to the GELAC. For example, should the amount
raised and spent for compliance costs be limited to a fixed percentage of the general election spending limit? If so,
what amount or percentage would be sufficient to ensure that adequate amounts are available for meeting compliance
obligations? Please note that this approach is not included in the proposed rules which Follow.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioners and one commenter also challenge the appropriateness of allowing fundraising costs for the GELAC
to be paid for by the GELAC on the ground these expenses are campaign expenses that should be subject to the spending
limits. The current rules permit fundraising costs to be paid by the GELAC because it would not be appropriate to sue
public funds to solicit private contributions that are used solely for legal and accounting compliance purposes.
However, the Commission is concerned that fundraising activities for the GELAC could be used to generate electoral
support for the candidate's campaign, and if so, should be treated as qualified campaign expenses. Accordingly,
comments are sought on whether to continue to permit the GELAC to pay the entire amount of these costs, or whether a fixed
percentage of GELAC fundraising costs should be paid by the general election campaign committee. Splitting the costs
would recognize that solicitations and other activities conducted to raised GELAC funds have a campaign-related
component. Comments are sought as to the appropriate percentage that should be paid from general election funds.
Please note that this approach is not included in the proposed rules which follow.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is also considering modifying section 9003.3(a)(1)(i)(A), which currently requires solicitations
to clearly state that the contributions are solicited for the GELAC. A new sentence would also require solicitations
to state that contributions to the GELAC may not be used for campaign purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Please note that the provisions regarding predesignations and transfer of primary funds to the GELAC in paragraphs
(a)(1) (ii)&hyph;(iv) would be reorganized.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current paragraphs (a)(2)(i) (A) through (H) of section 9003.3 set forth the permissible sues of GELAC funds. The
Petition for Rulemaking urged the Commission to delete current paragraph (H) allowing GELAC funds to be used to pay
unreimbursed costs of providing transportation for the Secret Service and national security staff. Although this
provisions is included in the attached proposed rules, the Commission seeks further comment on whether it is appropriate
to use GELAC funds for this purpose. Please note that GELAC funds may not be used to pay transition costs (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
cf.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 AO 1979&hyph;37); legal expenses not related to ensuring compliance, such as contract litigation or electoral college
expenses; and winding down expenses that are not for legal and accounting compliance purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Commission proposes reducing from 70% to 50% the standard amount that the GELAC may pay for computer-related
costs, and the corresponding exclusion from the spending limits. See 11 CFR 9003.3 (a)(2)(ii)(A), (b)(6) and (c)(6).
The GELAC is relatively small in comparison to the publicly funded general election account. Much of the computer
costs are for basic accounting purposes, which the campaign committee would need to perform regardless of the need
to comply with the campaign financing laws. Please note, however, that committees would still be able to deduct a higher
amount if they can show that their computer-related compliance costs are higher.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 9003.3(a)(2)(iv) would be modified slightly to clarify that funds remaining in the GELAC may only be used
to pay debts remaining from the primary or for other lawful purposes if all GELAC expenses have been paid. Finally the
Commission is proposing to revise two citations contained in 11 CFR 9003.3(a)(2)(iii). The first sentence of this
paragraph currently refers to paragraphs 9003.3(a)(2)(i) (A) through (E). This would be updated to read, ``11 CFR
9003.3(a)(2)(i) (A) through (F) and (H).'' Also, the citation to paragraph 9003.3(a)(2)(i)(F) in the second sentence
should instead refer paragraph 9003.3(a)(2)(i)(G).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 9004.5 of the Commission's regulations allows a committee to invest public funds or use them in other ways
to generate income, provided that an amount equal to the net income derived from those investments, minus any taxes
paid, is repaid to the Treasury. Section 9007.2(b)(4) also lists the receipt of any income as a result of investment
or other use of payments from the fund pursuant to 11 CFR 9004.5 as one of the basis for requiring repayment. These provisions
seek to ensure that any income received through these use of public funds benefits the public financing system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rules would indicate that section 9004.5 applies to any use of public funds that results in come to the
committee, regardless of whether the committee engaged in that use with the intention of generating income. The proposed
rules also contain a conforming amendment to section 9007.2(b)(4), which would indicate that income on investment
or other use of payments from the Fund must be repaid to the Treasury. The Comission notes that if a committee loses an
item that is insured, and the insurance proceeds exceeds the cost of replacing the item, such excess would be considered
income for the purposes of proposed sections 9004.5 and 9007.2(b)(4).

as the costs for data entry services performed by persons other than committee personnel and processing time. The
candidate shall keep detailed records to support such calculations. The records shall indicate which computer functions
are considered compliance-related and shall reflect which costs are associated with each computer function. The

pursuant to 11 CFR 9007.2. Any amounts so reimbursed to the federal fund account may not subsequently be transferred
back to the legal and accounting compliance fund.

campaign expenses, such expenditures shall count against the candidate's expenditure limit.

stop and from the stop through each subsequent campaign-related stop to the point of origin. If any campaign activity,
other than incidental contacts, is conducted at a stop, that stop shall be considered campaign-related. Campaign
activity includes soliciting, making, or accepting contributions, and expressly advocating the election or defeat
of any candidate. Other factors, including the setting, timing and statements or expressions of the purpose of an
event, the substance of the remarks or speech made, and the audience, will also be considered in determining whether

case of travel to a city served by regularly scheduled coach airline service, but not regularly scheduled first class
airline service; or

(C) The commercial charter rate for a comparable airplane (in terms of size, model and make), in the case of travel to
a city not served by a regularly scheduled commercial airline service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If a government airplane is flown to a campaign-related stop where it will pick up passengers, or from a campaign-related
stop where it left off passengers, the candidate's authorized committee shall pay the appropriate government entity

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, all contributions received by an individual from the date
he or she becomes a candidate and all matching payments received by the candidate shall be used only to defray qualified
campaign expenses or to repay loans or otherwise restore funds (other than contributions which were received and
expended to defray qualified campaign expenses), which were used to defray qualified campaign expenses.

Testing the waters.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Even though incurred prior to the date an individual becomes a candidate, payments made in accordance with 11 CFR 100.8(b)(1)
for the purpose of determining whether an individual should become a candidate shall be considered qualified campaign
expenses if the individual subsequently becomes a candidate and shall count against that candidate's limits under
2 U.S.C. 441a(b).

Winding down costs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Costs associated with the termination of political activity, such as the costs of complying with the post election
requirements of the Act and other necessary administrative costs associated with winding down the campaign, including
office space rental, staff salaries, and office supplies shall be considered qualified campaign expenses. A candidate
may receive and use matching funds for these purposes either after he or she has notified the Commission in writing
of his or her withdrawal from the campaign for nomination or after the date of the party's nominating convention, if
he or she has not withdrawn before the convention.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the candidate has become ineligible due to the operation of 11 CFR 9033.5(b),he or she may only receive matching
funds to defray costs incurred before the candidate's date of ineligibility, for goods and services to be received
before the date of ineligibility and for which written arrangement or commitment was made on or before the candidate's
date of ineligibility, until the candidate is eligible to receive winding down costs under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of
this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) For purposes of the expenditure limitations set forth in 11 CFR 9035.1, 100% of salary, overhead and computer
expenses incurred after a candidate's date of ineligibility may be treated as exempt legal and accounting compliance
expenses beginning with the first full reporting period after the candidate's date of ineligibility. For candidates
who continue to campaign or re-establish eligibility, this paragraph shall not apply to expenses incurred during
the period between the date of ineligibility and the date on which the candidate either re-establishes eligibility
or ceases to continue to campaign.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Taxes.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Federal income taxes paid by the committee on non-exempt function income, such as interest, dividends and sale of
property, shall be considered qualified campaign expenses. These expenses shall not, however, count against the
state or overall expenditure limits of 11 CFR 9035.1(a).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Gifts and monetary bonuses for committee employees, consultants and volunteers in recognition for campaign-related
activities or services shall be considered qualified campaign expenses, provided that the gifts do not exceed $150
total per individual, and provided that the total for all gifts and monetary bonuses (except bonus arrangements provided
for in advance in an employment or consulting contract) does not exceed $20,000.

Post-ineligibility expenditures.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Any expenses incurred after a candidate's date of ineligibility, as determined under 11 CFR 9033.5, are not qualified
campaign expenses except to the extent permitted under 11 CFR 9034.4(a)(3). Any expenses incurred before the candidate's
date of ineligibility for goods and services to be received after the candidate's date of ineligibility are not qualified
campaign expenses. In addition, any expenses incurred before the candidate's date of ineligibility for goods and
services to be received after the candidate's date of ineligibility, or for property, services, or facilities used
to benefit the candidate's general election campaign, are not qualified campaign expenses. For purposes of this
paragraph, it is presumed that capital assets delivered within 60 days of the first day of the candidate's party's
national nominating convention are general election assets; and that a local campaign office that remains open more
than 30 days after a state's primary election or the close of any other nomination process in that state is operating
in support of the general election campaign.

Factors in making this determination shall include, but not be limited to, whether the committee demonstrates that
it made conscientious efforts to safeguard the missing equipment; the type of equipment involved; the number of items
that were lost; and the value of the lost equipment as a percentage of the total value of the equipment leased or owned
by the committee.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The amount submitted as the total of outstanding campaign obligations under paragraph (a)(1) of this section
shall not include any accounts payable for nonqualified campaign expenses nor any amounts determined or anticipated
to be required a repayment under 11 CFR part 9038 or any amounts paid to secure a surety bond under 11 CFR 9038.5.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The amount submitted as estimated necessary winding down costs under paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be
broken down by expenses category and quarterly or monthly time period. This breakdown shall include estimated costs
for office space rental, staff salaries, office supplies, equipment rental, telephone expenses, postage and other
mailing costs, printing and storage. The breakdown shall estimate the costs that will be incurred in each category
from the time the statement is submitted until the expected termination of the committee's political activity.

 For purposes of this section, the term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
capital asset
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means any property used in the operation of the campaign whose purchase price exceeded $2000 when acquired by the committee.
Property that must be valued as capital assets under this section includes, but is not limited to, office equipment,
furniture, vehicles and fixtures acquired for use in the operation of the candidate's campaign, but does not include
property defined as ``other assets'' under 11 CFR 9034.5(c)(2). A list of all capital assets shall be maintained by
the Committee in accordance with 11 CFR 9033.11(d). The fair market value of capital assets may be considered to be
the total original cost of such items when acquired less than 40%, to account for depreciation, except that items acquired
after the date of ineligibility must be valued at their fair market value on the date acquired. If the candidate wishes
to claim a higher depreciation percentage for an item, he or she must list that capital asset on the statement separately
and demonstrate, through documentation, the fair market value of each such asset. The Commission may disallow all
or some portion of the 40% depreciation if the asset was obtained by the primary committee for use in the general election,
or falls within a presumption stated in 11 CFR 9034.4(b)(3).

(f)(1) The candidate shall submit a revised statement of net outstanding campaign obligations with each submission
for matching fund payments filed after the candidate's date of ineligibility. the revised statement shall reflect
the financial status of the campaign as of the close of business on the last business day preceding the date of submission
for matching funds. The revised statement shall also contain a brief explanation of each change in the committee's
assets and obligations from the previous statement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A candidate who makes a submission described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section shall also submit an additional
revised statement of net outstanding campaign obligations. This additional statement shall be due on a date to be
determined and published by the Commission, which will be before the next regularly scheduled payment date. This
statement shall reflect the financial status of the campaign as of the close of business three business days before
the due date of the statement. The revised statement shall also contain a brief explanation of each change in the committee's
assets and obligations from the previous statement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) After a candidate's date of ineligibility, if the candidate does not receive the entire amount of matching funds
on a regularly scheduled payment date due to a shortfall in the matching payment account, the candidate shall also
submit a revised statement of net outstanding campaign obligations. The revised statement shall be filed on a date
to be determined and published by the Commission, which will be before the next regularly scheduled payment date.

representatives to whom those services were provided. The amount sought shall not exceed the media representative's
pro rata share, or a reasonable estimate of the media representative's pro rata share, of the actual cost of the transportation
and services made available by more than 10%. Any reimbursement received in excess of 110% of the actual pro rata cost
of the transportation and services made available shall be disposed of in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.
For the purposes of this section: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A media representative's pro rata share shall be calculated by dividing the total actual cost of the transportation
and services by the total number of individuals to whom such transportation and services are made available. For purposes
of this calculation, the total number of individuals shall include committee staff, media personnel, Secret Service
personnel, national security staff and any other individuals to whom such transportation and services are made available;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) ``Administrative costs'' shall include all costs incurred by the committee for making travel arrangements
and for seeking reimbursement, whether performed by committee staff or independent contractors.

9035.1(a):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The amount of reimbursements received in payment for the transportation and services described in paragraph
(a) of this section, up to the actual cost of transportation and services provided; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An amount of reimbursements received representing the administrative costs incurred by the committee in providing
these services and seeking reimbursement for them, equal to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Three percent of the actual cost of transportation and services provided under this section; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) An amount in excess of 3% representing the administrative costs actually incurred by the committee, provided
that the committee is able to document that it incurred these higher administrative costs.

it shall dispose of the excess amount in the following manner:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Any reimbursement received in excess of 110% of the actual pro rata cost of the transportation and services made
available to a media representative shall be returned to the media representative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

campaign expenses and be reported by the candidate's authorized committee(s) as expenditures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(b) (1) For a trip which is entirely campaign-related, the total cost of the trip shall be a qualified campaign expense
and a reportable expenditure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For a trip which includes campaign-related and non-campaign related stops, that portion of the cost of the trip
allocable to campaign activity shall be a qualified campaign expense and a reportable expenditure. Such portion
shall be determined by calculating what the trip would have cost from the point of origin of the trip to the first campaign-related
stop and from that stop through each subsequent campaign-related stop, back to the point of origin. If any campaign
activity, other than incidental contacts, is conducted at a stop, that stop shall be considered campaign-related.
Campaign activity includes soliciting, making, or accepting contributions, and expressly advocating the election
or defeat of any candidate. Other factors, including the setting, timing and statements or expressions of the purpose
of an event, the substance of the remarks or speech made, and the audience, will also be considered in determining whether
a stop is campaign-related.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The lowest unrestricted and non-discounted first class commercial air fare available for the time traveled,
in the case of travel to a city served by a regularly scheduled commercial airline service; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The lowest unrestricted and non-discounted coach commercial air fare available for the time traveled, in the
case of travel to a city served by regularly scheduled coach airline service, but not regularly scheduled first class
airline service; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The commercial charter rate for a comparable airplane (in terms of size, model and make), in the case of travel to
a city not served by a regularly scheduled commercial airline service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If a government airplane is flown to a campaign-related stop where it will pick up passengers, or from a campaign-related
stop where it left off passengers, the candidates's authorized committee shall pay the appropriate government entity
an amount equal to the amount required under paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section for one passenger plus costs for fuel
and crew.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If any individual, including a candidate, uses a government conveyance, other than an airplane, for campaign-related
travel, the candidate's authorized committee shall pay the appropriate government entity an amount equal to the

committee shall pay the appropriate government entity an amount equal to the usual and normal charge for the accommodations,
and shall maintain documentation supporting the amount paid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) For travel by airplane, the committee shall maintain documentation for the lowest unrestricted nondiscounted

conveyance or accommodations, an amount equal to that portion of the actual cost of the conveyance or accommodations
which is allocable to all passengers, including the candidate, who are traveling for campaign purposes will be a qualified
campaign expense and shall be reported by the committee as an expenditure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If the trip is by charter, the actual cost for each passenger shall be determined by dividing the total operating
cost for the charter by the total number of passengers transported. The amount which is a qualified campaign expense
and a reportable expenditure shall be calculated in accordance with the formula set forth at 11 CFR 9034.7(b)(2) on
the basis of the actual cost per passenger multiplied by the number of passengers traveling for campaign purposes.

Sampling. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In conducting an audit of contributions pursuant to this section, the Commission may utilize generally accepted
sampling techniques to quantify, in whole or in part, the dollar value of related audit findings. A projection of the
total amount of violations based on apparent violations identified in such a sample may become the basis, in whole
or in part, or any audit finding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A committee in responding to a sample-based finding concerning excessive or prohibited contributions shall
respond only to the specific sample items used to make the projection. If the committee demonstrates that any errors
found among the sample items were not excessive or prohibited contributions; were timely refunded, reattributed
or redesignated pursuant to 11 CFR 103.3(b) (1), (2) and (3); or for some other reason were not errors; the Commission
shall make a new projection based on the reduced number of errors in the sample.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The committee shall submit a check to the United States Treasury for the total amount of any contributions not refunded,
reattributed or redesignated in a timely manner in accordance with 11 CFR 103.3(b) (1), (2) or (3).

to have been used for non-qualified campaign expenses as the amount of matching funds certified to the candidate bears

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) All matching funds certified in response to matching payment submissions received by the Commission as of the
candidate's date of ineligibility will be treated as though they were certified as of the date of ineligibility;

(C) In seeking repayment for non-qualified campaign expenses from committees that have received matching fund payments
after the candidate's date of ineligibility, the Commission will review committee expenditures to determine at
what point committee accounts no longer contain matching funds. In doing this, the Commission will review committee
expenditures from the date of the last matching fund payment to the candidate, using the assumption that the last payment
has been expended on a last-in, first-out basis.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations to require label warning statements for products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taken in solid oral dosage form to supplement the dietary intake 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of iron or to provide iron for therapeutic purposes. FDA is also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing regulations to require unit-dose packaging
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 for iron-containing products that contain 30 milligrams (mg) or more of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iron per dosage unit.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 FDA is proposing these regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because of the acute iron poisonings, including deaths in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
children less than 6 years of age, attributable to accidental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overdoses of iron-containing products. The intent of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulations is to reduce the risk of accidental iron poisonings of young children by utilizing FDA's authority
in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conjunction with the existing requirements of the U.S. Consumer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Product Safety Commission (CPSC) for child-resistant packaging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for household substances. This proposal responds to three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
citizen petitions (Docket Nos. 91P&hyph;0186/CP1, 93P&hyph;0306/CP1, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
93&hyph;0306/CP2) that requested that FDA take action to ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products containing iron or iron salts do not pose a health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazard to young children and infants.

For the purposes of this document ``unit-dose packaging'' means a method of packaging a product into a nonreusable
container designed to hold a single dosage unit intended for administration directly from that container, irrespective
of whether the recommended dose is one or more than one of these units.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Iron is an essential nutrient that, in certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances, can be toxic. For some women of child-bearing age 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and for some young children, iron from dietary sources alone may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be insufficient to meet their metabolic iron requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Access to products that provide iron is useful for these groups 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to ensure that their iron requirements are met. However, when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumed acutely in large quantities by young children, iron is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxic and can, in some cases, lead to death. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the mid 1980's, an upsurge in reported accidental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pediatric ingestion of iron-containing products has occurred 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref.1). This fact, and the many resultant injuries and deaths 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of children, have created a dilemma with respect to how to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that iron sources are available while still minimizing the risks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to children. In response, FDA is proposing regulations that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require that a warning be placed on labeling about the adverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects of acute, high dose iron ingestion by children and that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit-dose packaging be used for certain iron-containing products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These requirements, if adopted, will apply to iron-containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products in addition to the existing requirements of CPSC, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide that child-resistant packaging must be used for most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iron-containing products available (see section II.B. of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
document). The agency tentatively finds that the effect of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new requirements, in conjunction with those of CPSC, will be to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significantly reduce the risk of accidental pediatric iron 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
poisoning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The types of iron-containing products that have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with poisonings of young children are those offered in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solid oral dosage form (e.g., capsules and tablets) as: (1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Children's and adult's multi-vitamin/mineral supplements that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contain iron or iron salts (these products typically provide less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 30 mg of iron per dosage unit), (2) products intended for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use as iron supplements (these products typically contain 30 mg 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or more of iron per dosage unit), and (3) drug products that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contain iron or iron salts (these products typically contain 30 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mg or more of iron per dosage unit). In this document, the term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``iron-containing products'' refers to all of these types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is not aware of incidents of poisoning being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
caused by iron-containing products in liquid or powder form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, these products are not subject to this proposal. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency will consider what regulatory action is appropriate to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
take with regard to iron-containing products in liquid or powder 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
form if it becomes aware of information indicating that these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products have caused or can cause poisonings in children. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This document also does not bear in any way on conventional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foods containing naturally occurring or added iron. Pediatric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iron poisoning from consumption of iron-containing foods in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conventional food form is unlikely because of limitations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inherent in the large quantity of food that would have to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingested to cause an adverse effect in young children. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, a serving of a highly fortified breakfast cereal that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contains 100 percent of the recommended daily intake for iron of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18 mg, would provide only 7 percent of the amount of iron that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered necessary to produce symptoms of iron poisoning in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 kilograms (kg) (22 pounds (lb)) child (i.e., 25 milligrams 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(mg) per (/) kg of iron, which equates to 250 mg total iron for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 kg (22 lb) child. (See section I.B. of this document.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, the agency is not aware of any pediatric iron 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
poisonings that have resulted from ingestion of iron-containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foods in conventional food form.

A. The Iron Requirements of Children and Women of Childbearing Age 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Iron is an essential nutrient because it is a component of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
blood and muscle tissue and because of its role in metabolic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactions. Iron-containing compounds in the body may be grouped 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into two categories: (1) Those that serve metabolic functions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and (2) those associated with iron storage. The compounds in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the first category include hemoglobin (a component of red blood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cells), myoglobin (a muscle protein), and iron-containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enzymes. They account for approximately 80 percent of body iron. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compounds in the second category are involved in the maintenance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of iron homeostasis and include the storage compounds ferritin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and hemosiderin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the supply of dietary iron becomes inadequate to meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the body's needs, iron is mobilized from iron stores to maintain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the production of red blood cells and to perform other essential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iron-dependent functions. When body iron stores are low or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
depleted, as often occurs in women of child-bearing age and in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
very young children, a person is vulnerable to adverse effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with iron deficiency anemia and with a reduction in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
metabolic and body functions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the prevalence of iron deficiency in the U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population is low (Ref. 2), maintenance of adequate iron stores 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in women of childbearing age and in young children is an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
important public health issue. A woman's recommended daily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowance (RDA) for iron during pregnancy doubles from 15 to 30 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mg/day (Ref. 3). The importance of prenatal iron supplementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in preventing depletion of iron stores in pregnant women has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shown in several clinical trials (Ref. 4). Thus, pregnant women 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are often counseled to increase their iron intake through dietary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes and the use of iron-containing supplements or drugs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A committee of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended that all pregnant women should be screened for iron 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiency anemia at the first prenatal visit and at least once 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during each subsequent trimester (Ref. 5). The NAS committee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended, however, that iron supplementation should only be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
given when iron status is low or marginal, as indicated by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hemoglobin and serum ferritin, in comparison with standard values 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended by NAS for the specific trimester of pregnancy. When 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these clinical indicators reveal deficient iron status, the NAS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
committee recommended that the clinician prescribe 60 to 120 mg of supplemental iron per day. If iron status is marginal,
the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NAS committee recommended that the clinician prescribe 30 mg of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplemental iron per day. If iron status is normal, the NAS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
committee recommended that these be no iron supplementation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Aside from the iron needs that arise during pregnancy, women 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of child-bearing age have a higher requirement for iron than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other adults. (The RDA for women of child-bearing age is 15 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mg/day because of the depletion of iron through menstrual blood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loss. It is 10 mg/day for adult males and older adult women 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 3).) The difficulty of obtaining dietary intakes high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enough to replace those losses through consumption of a normal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diet is responsible for iron deficiency in some women of child-bearing age. For these women also, the use of iron-containing

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products may be prudent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Iron deficiency also affects young children (the RDA for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iron for children is 10 mg/day), particularly during the rapid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
growth period from 6 months to 4 years of age. Some young 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
children fail to develop adequate iron stores to supply the iron 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needed for their metabolic functions during this early growth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Survey (NHANES II) for children show that the prevalence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impaired iron status ranges from an estimated 3 to 12 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 2). Thus, iron supplementation may also be indicated in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
children whose iron needs are not met through dietary intake.

B. Iron Toxicity in Young Children 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the minimal toxic and lethal doses for iron have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not been clearly established (Ref. 6), the severity of iron 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
poisoning when an overdose has been ingested is related to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of iron absorbed into the circulatory system. Experts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have stated that ingestion of 25 mg/kg of iron (250 mg total iron 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a 10 kg child) may produce symptoms of poisoning, and that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingestion of 60 mg/kg total iron for a 10 kg child is the minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intake for the development of significant iron poisoning (Refs. 6 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 7). One source recommends emergency room evaluation when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingestion of iron exceeds 50 mg/kg (Ref. 6). An acute ingestion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of more than 250 mg/kg for a 10 kg child is typically considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a lethal dose for iron (Ref. 8). However, it has been reported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that ingestion of 100 to 200 mg/kg for a 10 kg child can be fatal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 9), and that ingestion of as little as 650 mg of iron (65 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mg/kg for a 10 kg child) has resulted in death (Ref. 7). Based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upon these reported values, acute ingestions of less than 1,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mg of iron appear to be likely to cause nonfatal injuries of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
varying severity, depending on the amount of ingested iron. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Iron overdose results in both local and systemic effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref 10). Toxicity is caused by both a direct corrosive effect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the gastrointestinal mucosa and the presence of unbound iron 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the circulatory system. Locally in the stomach and intestine, ingested iron is corrosive and produces death of
cells in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mucosa lining the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in ulceration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and hemorrhage. While intact mucosa limits the absorption of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iron, eroded mucosa permits absorption of relatively huge amounts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of iron into the portal circulation that goes immediately to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liver, causing damage to liver cells. Overload of the liver 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cells, which normally remove iron from the circulation, allows 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iron to enter the general circulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 When the circulating iron exceeds the capacity of certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proteins to bind it, free iron reaches other tissues, such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kidneys, lungs, heart and blood vessels, and the brain. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resultant death of cells in these tissues produces the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wide-spread symptoms and signs of iron poisoning: Kidney 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failure, edema in the lung, hemorrhage, hypotension from damage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the heart and blood vessels, coma from damage to the brain, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and acidosis from release of organic acids. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Severe iron poisoning is characterized by four clinical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stages (Refs. 6 and 9): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (1) Stage one, which may occur within 30 minutes (min) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingestion, is characterized primarily by signs and symptoms of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hemorrhagic gastroenteritis (i.e., nausea, vomiting, abdominal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pain, hematemesis (vomiting blood), and bloody diarrhea) that may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
progress to shock, coma, seizures, and death. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (2) During stage two, which occurs from 2 to 12 hours (hr) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after ingestion, patients may be without symptoms and may appear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to have recovered. Some children will recover, but some may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
progress to stage three. The appearance of recovery should not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delay evaluation and treatment for iron poisoning because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
successful treatment is difficult once the iron is absorbed from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the small intestine into the blood. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (3) During stage three, from 12 to 48 hr after ingestion, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there is a recurrence of gastrointestinal hemorrhage with severe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lethargy or coma, and there may be liver and kidney failure and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collapse of the heart and blood vessels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (4) Stage four, 3 to 4 weeks after survivors of poisonings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingested the iron, may include gastrointestinal obstruction and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cirrhosis of the liver. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In evaluating a child who is thought to have ingested an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overdose of iron, an abdominal x-ray looking for iron-containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tablets, a qualitative color test for iron in the stomach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contents, and an emergency determination of the concentration of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iron in blood plasma may be performed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 If an overdose of iron is indicated, an emetic agent may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administered to cause regurgitation of the iron if the patient is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fully awake and alert. In addition to emesis, catharsis with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
saline or sorbitol may be used to induce gastric emptying. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, neither emesis nor catharsis is advised if hemorrhagic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gastroenteritis is present. Gastric lavage, i.e., washing out of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the stomach, with saline or sodium bicarbonate or whole bowel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
irrigation with a balanced polyethylene glycol-electrolyte 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solution by gastric tube have been used to remove undissolved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tablets (Ref. 11).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Treatment for an iron overdose frequently includes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parenteral administration of deferoxamine (also referred to as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
desferrioxamine), a drug which chelates (i.e., binds) iron in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intracellular fluid and causes its excretion in urine (Ref. 6). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given that 1 g deferoxamine can bind 93 mg of iron, and that, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
avoid hypotension, infusion is generally recommended at 15 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mg/kg/hr, there is a limit to the amount of iron deferoxamine can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bind. For example, safe administration of deferoxamine to a 10 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kg child over a 24 hr period is capable of binding only 324 mg of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iron (Refs. 11 and 12). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Therefore, if very high levels of iron are absorbed, even 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prompt treatment with deferoxamine or another agent may not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevent a fatal outcome if chelation at the maximum safe rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cannot reduce the iron burden to levels below those that cause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
death. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Speed of diagnosis and therapy are important. With earlier 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and more effective treatment, the mortality rate from iron 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
poisoning has been reduced from as high as 45 percent to about 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent (Ref. 9).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Data have been submitted to or obtained by FDA on reports of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deaths attributable to accidental pediatric iron poisoning that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were made between 1983 and 1993 to the American Association of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Poison Control Centers and between 1986 and 1993 to CPSC (Table 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1). Although these two sets of data are not identical, they do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have extensive overlap (cases included in both databases). They 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both point to an increase in reported fatalities from accidental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iron poisonings of children in the early 1990's. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The number or rate of fatalities does not represent the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
totality of the health hazard, however. Data obtained by FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
show that from 1986 through 1992 there were nearly 63,000 reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to poison control centers involving ingestion of adult iron- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing products, with over 47,000 of these reports involving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
children under 6 years of age (Refs. 14 through 20). Many of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these victims required hospitalization, and many others required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some medical treatment. For example, Table 2 shows that over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1,500 of these cases were classified as having ``moderate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outcomes,'' i.e., the patient had symptoms that, while not life 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threatening, usually required some form of treatment. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hundred fifty-nine cases were classified as ``major outcomes,'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i.e., they were life threatening or resulted in permanent injury. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Except for 1992, AAPCC data do not indicate how many of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moderate and major outcomes involved children under 6 years of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
age. However, for 1992, 55 percent (17/31) of the major 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outcomes, and 51 percent (141/278) of the moderate outcomes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involved children under 6 years of age.

In addition, AAPCC data show that during the same 7-year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period, there were over 76,000 reports to poison control centers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involving ingestion of pediatric iron-containing products with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over 69,000 of these reports involving children under 6 years of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
age (Refs. 14 through 20). Table 3 shows that over 495 of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cases were classified as having ``moderate outcomes,'' and 29 cases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were classified as ``major outcomes.'' Again, except for 1992, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AAPCC data do not indicate how many of the moderate and major

outcomes involved children under 6 years of age. However, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1992, the single major outcome, and 91 percent (52/57) of the

Likewise, CPSC reports that, based upon data from its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) (NEISS is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a probability sample of hospital emergency rooms in the United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States that is used by the CPSC to measure the magnitude of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injury problem associated with consumer products and to provide a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source for followup investigations of selected cases), there was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a significant upward trend in the estimated number of hospital 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emergency room-treated iron ingestion cases involving children 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under 5 years of age in the 1980 to 1993 period. Every annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimate in the 1980 to 1985 period was smaller than every annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimate in the 1986 to 1993 period. The estimated average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of cases annually was 1,240 for the 1980 to 1985 period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 3,170 for the 1986 to 1993 period (Ref. 1).

2. CPSC Case Reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
CPSC considers iron-containing products to be potentially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazardous to children and, thus, has taken a number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant steps designed to reduce the risk from these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. As part of its efforts, CPSC has collected detailed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information on pediatric iron poisoning fatalities and has also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted followup (from NEISS data) investigations of incidents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of nonfatal pediatric iron ingestion where the victim was taken 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to a hospital emergency room. In order to evaluate the available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data on specific occurrences of iron poisoning as fully as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible, FDA obtained from CPSC the case reports on 37 fatal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pediatric poisonings (Ref. 21) and on 70 NEISS followup 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigations of nonfatal pediatric iron ingestions for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years 1986 to 1993 (Ref. 22). These data are described below and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are summarized in Tables 4 and 5. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Table 4 summarizes the data obtained from CPSC on 37 iron 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
poisoning fatalities of young children since 1986. Among these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fatalities, the average age of the victim was 16.8 months. In 25 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of these 37 deaths, the iron potency of the implicated product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was reported. These 25 products contained, on average, 63 mg 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iron per dosage unit. The lowest reported potency of an iron-containing product involved in these pediatric deaths
was 40 mg 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iron per dosage unit. The potency of the iron-containing product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involved in the 12 other deaths was not reported. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Table 4 shows that, in 21 of the 37 fatalities, information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the number of tablets or capsules consumed by the victim was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reported. Among these 21 reports, the average number of iron 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tablets or capsules consumed by the victim was 39. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Table 4 also shows that in 56 percent of these 37 pediatric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deaths (21/37), the iron-containing product visually appeared to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be packaged in child-resistant packaging (CRP), and more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically, in containers with apparently child-resistant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closures (CRC). In 16 percent of the deaths (6/37), the iron-containing supplement was not packaged in CRP. Among
the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remaining deaths (10/37), the type of packaging was not reported.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Among the 21 reported pediatric poisoning deaths that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involved iron-containing products packaged in CRP, Table 4 shows 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that 29 percent (6/21) of these deaths resulted from iron- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing products whose child-resistant package was reportedly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opened (actually or possibly) by the victim. In 14 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3/21) of these deaths, the CRP was reported to have been opened 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(actually or possibly) by another child. An adult was reported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to have opened the CRP in 19 percent (4/21) of the pediatric iron 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
poisoning deaths. Among the remaining reports of pediatric iron 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deaths in which the iron-containing product was packaged in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
child-resistant containers, the means of opening the container 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were not identified in 24 percent (5/21). The CRP was reported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be defective in 14 percent (3/21) of these deaths. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Table 5 shows the total amount of iron ingested in the fatal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
poisoning incidents in which both the amount of tablets ingested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the iron potency of these tablets were reported. Among 17 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fatalities, in all but 1 case, the iron potency of the tablets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was 60 to 65 mg, and with 1 exception (the same reported case), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the calculated amount of iron ingested was at least 900 mg. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 70 case reports of NEISS followup investigations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonfatal pediatric iron ingestions involved 80 children. The 80 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
children were either treated in the emergency room and released 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or hospitalized for a period of time. Table 6 summarizes these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
case reports. The average age of the children was about 31 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
months.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The types of products ingested were described as iron 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tablets, iron pills, prenatal vitamins, vitamins for anemia, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multivitamins, and children's vitamins. Children's vitamins were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the most numerous and were involved in 56 percent (45/80) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cases, followed by prenatal vitamins in 23 percent (18/80). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sixty percent (48/80) of the iron products were nonprescription 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
items, and 25 percent (20/80) were prescription items. (The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remainder were not described.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The average number of tablets ingested by the children was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about 20 tablets, and the greatest number was 80 tablets. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
child was taken to the emergency room as a precaution, but it was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discovered that the child had not actually swallowed any tablets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The iron potency of the product was documented only in 13 case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports and in those, it ranged from 15 to 65 mg. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most of the iron products (80 percent, 64/80) were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reportedly packaged in CRP, whereas 10 percent (8/80) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products were reportedly not packaged in CRP. In the remainder 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the cases, the iron products were in packages with lost lids, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the product had been removed from the original container, or no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
details were reported. The victims opened the CRP in 45 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(36/80) of the cases. In 16 percent (13/80) of the cases, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
victim was able to open the CRP because the lid was not secured tightly, whether by intent or accidentally, by an adult.
A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
family member such as a sibling, cousin, or mother opened the CRP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in 18 percent (15/80) of the incidents, allowing the victim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
access to the iron product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Elevated iron serum levels were reported in 18 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(14/80) of the reports, and normal levels were reported in 3 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the cases. However, most of the cases (79 percent, 63/80) did 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not report test results for serum iron. Eighty-six percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(69/80) of the cases were treated and released from the hospital, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
while 14 percent (11/80) were admitted to the hospital. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Symptoms, or lack of symptoms, were reported for 34 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
80 children. The symptoms included diarrhea, vomiting, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lethargy. Gastrointestinal symptoms were the most common, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vomiting occurred 18 times, diarrhea occurred 8 times, and 2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
children suffered both vomiting and diarrhea. Fever and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constipation were reported only for the 3-month old victim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cramps, nausea, drowsiness, dizziness, hyperactivity, and profuse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sweating were other symptoms that were documented only once each. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A combination of at least two symptoms were documented for eight 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
children. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two of the pediatric iron poisoning incidents, including one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fatality, occurred after an adult removed several dosage units 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from their original container and stored them in nonchild-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resistant containers, as follows: (1) ``The aunt took the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prenatal vitamin pills out of their original container and placed them in a tin can that was half full of pennies.''
(Ref. 22, case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report No. 23.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) ``For reasons as yet unknown, she (the mother) took them 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the original container believed to be equipped with a child-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resistant closure, and put them in a container that was not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipped with a child-resistant closure, possibly a vitamin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bottle.'' (Ref. 21, case report No. 21.)

1. Petitions Submitted to FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FDA has received three citizen petitions requesting that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency take various actions concerning labeling, packaging, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formulation for iron-containing products. One of the petitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested that the agency undertake efforts to educate the public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about the danger of pediatric iron poisoning. The petitions were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted by the American Association of Poison Control Centers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(the AAPCC petition) (Docket No. 91P&hyph;0186/CP1) (Ref. 12); the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Attorneys General of 34 States, Commonwealths, and Territories 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(the AG petition) (Docket No. 93P&hyph;0306/CP1) (Ref. 13); and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nonprescription Drug Manufacturers Association (the NDMA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petition) (Docket No. 93P&hyph;0306/CP2) (Ref. 23). The principal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issues in these petitions are summarized in Table 7 and discussed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in this section.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The AAPCC petition.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The AAPCC petition was submitted on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
April 30, 1991, and was supplemented by an additional submission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by AAPCC on February 28, 1992. It was based upon pediatric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
poisoning data collected by the AAPCC National Data Collection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
System from 1983 through 1991. The petition stated that iron 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products are the leading cause of poisoning deaths in children 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under age six. A letter was submitted to the agency in support 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the AAPCC petition by the American Academy of Pediatrics on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
February 17, 1993. The AAPCC petition requested that the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
take the following actions concerning the labeling and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formulation of iron-containing products: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Labeling.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The petition requested that FDA declare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labels on drug products and food supplements containing 30 mg or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more of iron per dosage unit as misleading if the label does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clearly state that accidental pediatric ingestion of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products can be lethal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Formulation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The petition requested that the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
urge the industry to voluntarily reformulate iron-containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products containing 30 mg or more of iron per dosage unit in less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attractive dosage units, specifically avoiding resemblance to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
popular candies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AAPCC petition also requested that the agency initiate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an educational effort to alert the public and health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professionals to the dangers of accidental pediatric ingestion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iron-containing products. The AAPCC stated that efforts need to be directed especially to parents, babysitters,
daycare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providers, and other consumers; to pediatricians, urging these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health professionals to target parents at the 6-month visit; to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obstetricians, urging these health professionals to educate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mothers at the final postpartum visit; to other health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professionals who prescribe iron-containing products; and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pharmacists who dispense them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The AG petition.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The AG petition, submitted on August 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16, 1993, cited data on injuries and deaths attributable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accidental iron poisoning in children reported to the AAPCC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Data Collection System and reported to CPSC through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1992. It requested that the agency take the following actions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerning the labeling, formulation, and packaging of iron- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing products: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Labeling.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For iron-containing products containing 30 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mg iron or more per tablet or capsule, the petition requested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the agency promulgate a regulation requiring that the label 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bear a conspicuous boxed warning that states: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The petition recommended that this warning be in bold face type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and in a color that contrasts with the background and with other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
printed material on the label and labeling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The petition also recommended that immediately following the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above boxed warning, the following information appear: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Acute overdosage of iron may cause nausea and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vomiting and, in severe cases, cardiovascular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collapse and death. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For iron-containing products containing less than 30 mg iron 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per tablet or capsule, the petition recommended that the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promulgate a regulation requiring that the label contain a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conspicuous boxed warning that states: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->

c. Nonprescription Drug Manufacturers Association petition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Nonprescription Drug Manufacturers Association (NDMA), a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trade association that represents U.S. manufacturers and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distributors of nonprescription medicines and vitamin and mineral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products, submitted a citizen petition to FDA on October 15, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993, in response to the AG petition. The NDMA petition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested that FDA adopt into regulation the newly initiated voluntary NDMA program on the labeling, packaging,
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formulation of iron-containing products. NDMA stated that it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted a similar petition to CPSC requesting that CPSC adopt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into regulation the elements of the voluntary industry program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are under the regulatory jurisdiction of CPSC. The petition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also requested that FDA deny the other citizen petitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted on iron-containing products and pediatric poisoning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insofar as they would contradict, add to, or subtract from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NDMA program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NDMA petition requested that FDA adopt the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labeling, formulation, and packaging provisions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Labeling.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Iron-containing products must bear on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primary container (or box for blister packaging, glassine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
envelope, etc.), conspicuously, prominently, and clearly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distinguished from other labeling by type, color, or contrast, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the following warning statement: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Warning: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Close tightly and keep out of reach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of children. Contains iron, which can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harmful or fatal to children in large doses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In case of accidental overdose, seek 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professional assistance or contact a Poison 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Control Center immediately. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The petition stated that in circumstances in which the packaging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
did not involve a reclosable CRP element (e.g., cap to a bottle), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the term ``close tightly'' would not need to appear in the warning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement.

Packaging. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NDMA specifically requested that FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deny the request made by the AG petition to require that iron- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing products containing 30 mg or more of iron per tablet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be packaged in child-resistant individual blister packs. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
support of this request, NDMA pointed out that its voluntary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program calls for the packaging of all iron-containing products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with 30 mg or more iron per dose in complying CRP (i.e., there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be no CRP-exempt sizes for this type of product). (See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussion on CRP requirements of CPSC in section II.B. of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
document.) NDMA noted that its voluntary program is being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carried out in conjunction with a national consumer education 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
campaign that it launched with CPSC on September 27, 1993, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conjunction with CPSC's Conference on Pediatric Iron Poisonings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Fatalities, which was held on September 28, 1993, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Washington, DC.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Formulation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NDMA stated that iron-containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products with greater than or equal to 30 mg iron per solid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dosage form will not be formulated with sweet outer coatings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

2. The Consumer Product Safety Commission Conference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CPSC held this conference because of the increase in iron 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
poisonings of children. The objective of the conference was to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide a forum for health care professionals and representatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of government and industry to identify solutions to this problem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The conference included invited speakers from CPSC, AAPCC, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Georgetown University, FDA, NDMA, the National Nutritional Foods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Association (NNFA), and the Office of the New York State Attorney General. This conference highlighted the seriousness
of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the pediatric iron poisoning problem and the steps that were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being taken to address the problem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Factors that may have contributed to the increased incidence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of pediatric iron poisonings were discussed, including the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement by many women for iron supplementation during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pregnancy; the use of iron-containing products in homes where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small children are present; the ability of older siblings of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential victims to open CRP; the misconception that vitamin and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mineral products are inherently safe; improper use or failure to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properly close child-resistant closures; and the formulation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some iron-containing products to appear like candy, potentially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
explaining why some children consumed large quantities of tablets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(30 to 100 tablets). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CPSC described the regulations that it issued in 1978 under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Poison Prevention Packaging Act, which require CRP on most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drugs and food supplements with more than 250 mg of iron per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
container (see section II.B. of this document). CPSC noted that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its Office of Compliance and Enforcement recently discovered that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
several manufacturers of iron-containing products were not using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CRP, and that some of these manufacturers had voluntarily agreed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to recall these products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At this conference, FDA explained that most iron-containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products are regulated as dietary supplements under the food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA noted that, although there are currently no specific regulations for iron-containing supplements, the general
food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety and food labeling provisions of the act require that all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foods, including iron-containing supplements, be safe under their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended conditions of use, and that their labeling be truthful 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and nonmisleading. FDA also noted that iron-containing products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are regulated as drugs under the drug provisions of the act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be approved before marketing as safe and effective for their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended conditions of use and are subject to labeling and good 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturing practice requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The industry's voluntary efforts in response to the iron 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
poisoning problem were described by representatives of NDMA and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NNFA. NDMA described its newly initiated voluntary program of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
packaging, labeling, and formulation changes which it had 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petitioned FDA to adopt into regulation. NDMA also described the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
newly launched joint consumer education campaign that it had 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developed in cooperation with CPSC to inform adults how to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protect children from accidental iron poisoning. (See section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IV.B. of this document.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NNFA stated that its members were adopting a voluntary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program similar to NDMA's, with the added provision that iron 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be limited to a maximum of 30 mg per dosage unit and 30 mg 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per recommended dose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In an open discussion of possible solutions, several ways to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
address the problem of pediatric iron poisoning were suggested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These suggestions included:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Packaging changes for iron-containing products with 30 mg or more iron per dosage unit, including packaging these
products in child-resistant unit-dose (e.g., blister) packages and not offering such products in packaging that
is not child- resistant (no exempt sizes). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Reformulating iron-containing products that resemble candy and that have a sweet outer coating to discourage

(5) Multi-ethnic educational efforts to increase public awareness of the dangers associated with iron and patient
counseling by obstetricians, gynecologists, and pharmacists, because many poisonings involve iron-containing
drug products.

Several participants at the conference commended the trade associations for their voluntary programs. However,
some participants urged that child-resistant unit-dose blister packaging, an element not included in the voluntary
industry programs, be implemented as a significant measure to reduce the incidence of iron poisonings. The participants
in the conference called upon industry, government, and the healthcare community to undertake efforts, including
cooperative efforts, to address this problem.

E. The Scope and Purpose of this Document 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this document is to: (1) Propose requirements designed to reduce the risk of pediatric poisonings from
the accidental ingestion of iron-containing products, (2) solicit additional information concerning the issue,
raised in the petitions, of reformulating iron-containing products to avoid the resemblance to candy and to avoid
use of a sweet outer coating, and (3) describe the efforts that FDA intends to undertake to respond to the need for public
education concerning iron poisonings, reinforcing the NDMA/CPSC education campaign. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated above, the agency believes that the new requirements that it is proposing, in conjunction with CPSC's existing
requirements for CRP for iron-containing products (see section II.B. of this document), will significantly reduce
the risk of accidental pediatric iron poisoning. FDA and CPSC have worked together closely in coordinating their
respective efforts toward this goal, and the two agencies intend to continue to work in close cooperation.

This proposal addresses iron-containing products available as dietary supplements and as prescription drug products.

FDA defined ``dietary supplement'' as a food, not in conventional food form, that supplies a component to supplement
the diet by increasing the total dietary intake of that component (59 FR 425, January 4, 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Types of iron-containing products that meet the definition of a dietary supplement and are regulated as foods include
products intended for use primarily to supplement the dietary intake of iron (iron supplements) and multi-vitamin/mineral
supplements that contain iron. Products intended for use as iron supplements generally contain 30 mg or more or iron
per dosage unit, while multi-vitamin/mineral supplements generally contain 18 mg or less of iron per dosage unit.

Iron-containing products that are regulated as prescription drugs include iron preparations that also contain
folic acid and that are prescribed to meet requirements during pregnancy. These products are regulated as drugs because
of the amount of folic acid that they contain. These products generally contain 30 mg or more of iron per dosage unit.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Safety of iron and iron salts added to dietary supplements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The act is intended to ensure that all food, including dietary supplements, is safe. The act does so, in part, by stipulating
that no substances may be added to food unless they are safe. FDA has defined ``safe'' as meaning there is a reasonable
certainty that no harm will result from the use of an ingredient in food (&sect;170.3(i)(21 CFR 170.3(i)). The determination
as to whether there is a ``reasonable certainty of no harm'' can be made in a number of ways. The two most common are the
existence of general recognition among qualified experts that the substance will be safe for its intended use (GRAS)
(see &sect;170.3) or a determination by FDA that the use of the substance is safe (see sections 201(s), 402(a)(2)(C),
and 409 of the act (21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C) and 348)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 201(s) of the act, for a substance to be GRAS, general recognition of its safety must exist among experts
qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety of substances directly or indirectly added
to food. The experts' conclusion as to the safety of the substance for its intended use may be based on either: (1) Scientific
procedures, that is, published scientific evidence that provides the quantity and quality of scientific evidence
that would justify listing the use of the substance as a food additive; or (2) in the case of a substance used in food prior
to January 1, 1958, evidence derived from common use of the substance in food.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 409(c)(1)(A) of the act, the agency is authorized to prescribe the conditions of safe use of the substance,
including, but not limited to: ``*&blank;*&blank;* specifications as to the particular food or classes of food in
or on which such additive may be used, the maximum quantity which may be used or permitted to remain in or on such food,
the manner in which such additive may be added to or used in or on such food, and any directions or other labeling or packaging
requirements for such additive deemed necessary by [the Secretary of Health and Human Services] to assure the safety
of such use.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 402(a)(1) of the act also provides authority to take action to ensure that food is not harmful. It states:

A food shall be deemed to be adulterated_(a)(1) If it bears or contains any poisonous or deleterious substance which
may render it injurious to health; but in case the substance is not an added substance such food shall not be considered
adulterated under this clause if the quantity of such substance in such food does not ordinarily render it injurious
to health.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Using its authority under these sections of the act, FDA has reviewed the safety of various iron salts that are used
in food. FDA listed reduced iron, ferrous gluconate, ferrous lactate, ferrous sulfate, ferric phosphate, ferric
pyrophosphate, and ferric sodium pyrophosphate as GRAS nutrients in a regulation published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 20, 1959 (24 FR 9368). Subsequently, FDA listed iron and these compounds as GRAS ``nutrients and/or dietary
supplements'' in a regulation published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of January 31, 1961 (26 FR 938). In addition, the ferrous salt of fumaric acid (&sect;172.350 (21 CFR 172.350)) (originally
promulgated as 21 CFR 121.1130 (29 FR 559, January 23, 1964) and iron-choline citrate complex (&sect;172.350 (21
CFR 172.370)) (originally promulgated as 21 CFR 121.247 (28 FR 4509, May 4, 1963)) have been listed by the agency as
food additives for use in foods for special dietary use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a final rule published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of September 5, 1980 (45 FR 58837), the agency divided the ``nutrients and/or dietary supplements'' category into
separate listings for ingredients whose intended use was as a dietary supplement (part 182 (21 CFR part 182), subpart
F) and for ingredients whose intended use was as a nutrient supplement in foods in conventional food form (part 182,
subpart I). For example, reduced iron is listed as GRAS in &sect;182.5375 for use as a dietary supplement ingredient
and in &sect;182.8375 for use in food in conventional form as a nutrient. Similarly, ferric phosphate (&sect;182.5301),
ferric pyrophosphate (&sect;182.5304), ferric sodium pyrophosphate (&sect;182.5306), ferrous gluconate (&sect;182.5308),
ferrous lactate (&sect;182.5311), and ferrous sulfate (&sect;182.5315) are listed as GRAS for use as dietary supplement
ingredients and are listed in &sect;182.8301, 182.8304, 182.8308, 182.8311, and 182.8315, respectively, as GRAS
for use as nutrients in food in conventional food form.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a regulation published on May 12, 1988 (53 FR 16862), the agency affirmed that elemental iron (21 CFR 184.1375),
ferrous ascorbate (21 CFR 184.1307a), ferrous carbonate (21 CFR 184.1307b), ferrous citrate (21 CFR 184.1307c),
ferrous fumarate (21 CFR 184.1307d), ferrous gluconate (21 CFR 184.1308), ferrous lactate (21 CFR 184.1311), ferrous
sulfate (21 CFR 184.1315), ferric ammonium citrate (21 CFR 184.1296), ferric citrate (21 CFR 184.1298), ferric phosphate
(21 CFR 184.1301), and ferric pyrophosphate (21 CFR 184.1304) are GRAS for use as nutrient supplements, as that use
is defined in 21 CFR 170.3(o)(20), and removed their listing from part 182, subpart I. However, in the final rule, FDA
did not affirm that these iron salts are GRAS for use in dietary supplements (i.e., in forms such as capsules, tablets,
or liquids) because there were insufficient data on their consumption as dietary supplement ingredients. However,
these ingredients continue to be listed as GRAS for use in dietary supplements under part 182, subpart F.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even though FDA has affirmed as GRAS the use of numerous iron salts in foods, there are differences in the toxicity of
these various salts.

Safety and efficacy of iron-containing drugs. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also authorizes FDA to regulate the marketing of any products to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
help ensure that the products are safe and effective for their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended uses. ``New drugs'' may not be introduced into interstate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commerce unless they are the subject of approved new drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications (NDA's)(25 U.S.C. 355(a)). The act defines a ``new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drug'' as: (1) Any drug (except a new animal drug or an animal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
feed bearing or containing a new animal drug) the composition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which is such that such drug is not generally recognized among 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experts qualified by scientific training and experience to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluate the safety and effectiveness of drugs, as safe and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or suggested in the labeling thereof; or (2) any drug the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
composition of which is such that such drug, as a result of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigations to determine its safety and effectiveness for use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under such conditions, has become so recognized, but which has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not, otherwise than in such investigations, been used to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material extent or for a material time under such conditions (21 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S.C. 321(b)). In order to be approved, an NDA must contain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate data to demonstrate that the drug product is safe and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or suggested in the labeling (21 U.S.C. 355(d)). In addition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for NDA approval, the product must be manufactured using current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
good manufacturing practice and the product labeling must not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
false or misleading (21 U.S.C. 355(d)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 411 of the act (21 U.S.C. 350) provides that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary of Health and Human Services may not classify any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
natural or synthetic vitamin or mineral (or combination thereof) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a drug solely because it exceeds the level of potency which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary determines is nutritionally rational or useful 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
except in the case of a vitamin, mineral, other ingredient of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
food, or food, which is represented for use by individuals in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment or management of specific diseases or disorders, by

children (individuals under the age of 12 years), or by pregnant

Most of the iron-containing products that FDA regulates are

considered dietary supplements. The iron-containing products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that FDA currently regulates as drug products are generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prescription products and are so designated, in most cases, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because they contain an amount of folic acid that exceeds the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount in which folic acid may be used as a food additive (see 21

For nonprescription covered products, the PPPA permits one type of package for each product to be sold without special
packaging if all other package types of the product comply with the requirements. However, exempt packages must bear
a conspicuous label stating: ``This package for households without young children.'' CPSC may, by regulation, prescribe
a substitute statement to the same effect for packaging too small to accommodate this statement.

CPSC provides for testing for special packaging in 16 CFR 1700.20. This regulation establishes test protocols to
evaluate child-resistant effectiveness and adult accessibility to such packaging. Recently, CPSC proposed to
amend 16 CFR 1700.20 to establish new test protocols under which CRP is evaluated (55 FR 40856, October 5, 1990, and
59 FR 13264, March 21, 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In establishing these regulations, CPSC considered the degree and nature of the hazard to children from accidental
acute overdose of dietary supplements and drugs containing iron. It found that special packaging is required to protect
children from serious injury from ingesting iron-containing drugs and dietary supplements. This finding was based
on: (1) Data from FDA's National Clearing House for Poison Control Centers (no longer in operation) and NEISS, which
showed that products containing iron are frequently ingested by children under the age of 5 years; (2) published human
experience data, symptomatology associated with many of the National Clearinghouse for Poison Control Centers
ingestion reports, and data from death certificates, which showed that the accidental ingestion of 250 mg or more
of iron has caused death or serious illness; and (3) the fact that iron-containing drugs and dietary supplements are
normally stored in their original containers, and that many accidental ingestions of these products result from
children gaining access to the contents of the original container (43 FR 17335, April 21, 1978).

1. Review of Labeling Issues in Citizen Petitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted in section I.D.1. of this document, the AG and NDMA petitions agreed that iron-containing products should
bear label warning statements. However, these petitions did not agree on what the warning should state, or on how it
should appear on the label. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In requesting the labeling provisions described in section I.D.1. of this document, the AG petition stated that the
hazard presented by iron-containing products is the result, in part, of the perception that they are nontoxic household
products. Thus, according to this petition, they are likely to be left within easy reach of children and not kept properly
secured. The petition also noted that these products are extremely attractive to children because of their typical
candy-like appearance and sweet outer coating and pointed to case reports that illustrate how children ingest iron
tablets in large quantities (see Table 4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AG petition stated that the recent increase in iron poisoning deaths among children might reflect an increase
in the extension of primary health care, especially prenatal care. It noted: ``While more doctors are prescribing
prenatal iron supplementation to more women, there has been no concomitant increase in warnings regarding their
potentially lethal effects.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AG petition also noted that, while more women were using iron-containing products, the labeling of these products
does not reflect the dangers inherent in their misuse: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
While labeling for a few multi-vitamins containing iron bears the statement that iron can be harmful in large doses,
most iron supplements bear only the non-specific phrase, ``Keep out of reach of children.'' Few, if any, packages
of iron supplements contain the word ``WARNING'' or ``CAUTION,'' words universally accepted as denoting danger,
to alert the user to the dangers of iron overdose. Further, the meager statements that do exist are, for the most part,
printed in the same color and type size as other material on the label and therefore fail to catch anyone's attention.
The statements are often obscured within other small print on the labeling and are neither prominent nor specific
enough to reach parents with a warning about these pills' potential fatal effect on children. Consumers who have no
knowledge of iron's hazards before purchasing iron supplements will not gain that knowledge by purchasing the product
and examining the label. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The AG petition presented data showing that many iron-containing products commonly available do not carry any label
information conveying the need to keep the product out of the reach of children or conveying any message specific to
iron poisoning. A summary, which was included as part of the AG petition, of the label information found on 25 commonly
available iron-containing products revealed that 10 of the 25 did not include information on the label that the product
should be kept away from children, and that 17 did not contain information stating that iron could be harmful. Six of
the products had no cautionary information at all, and none of the products that did have cautionary information used
the terms ``WARNING'' or ``CAUTION,'' to accompany the statements on the label. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NDMA, in its petition, stated that its proposed warning label was more appropriate than that proposed in the AG petition
because its warning goes beyond awareness in its focus and extends its message to include information that is preventive
in nature, i.e., ``Close tightly,'' and treatment oriented, i.e., ``In case of accidental overdose seek professional
assistance immediately.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NDMA also argued for allowing for flexibility in the manner in which the warning statement is to be applied to the label.
The petition stated:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been the experience of NDMA members in implementing the Association's Label Readability Guidelines that such
factors as contrast, color, type size, substrate, paragraphing, etc. are inter-related in a complex way on labeling,
such that goal- oriented flexibility is perhaps the most important principle in assuring prominence to special label
language. That is to say, specifying a box, when boxed labeling may already be stipulated under NLEA regulations,
is not necessarily as good a way to ensure prominence to label language as is a more flexible approach whose goal is to
ensure that the language is conspicuous, prominent and clearly distinguishable from other labeling.

2. Agency Response 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA considered the following questions in evaluating and responding to the labeling issues raised in the citizen
petitions: (1) Should label warning statements that alert users to the potential dangers that iron-containing products
pose to young children be required on these products? (2) If so, what legal authority does the agency have to require
such statements on food and drug products? (3) What should the warning be required to state? and (4) How should the warning
appear on the label?

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Should label warning statements be required for iron-containing products?
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Based on the data in the AAPCC and AG 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petitions and in the CPSC case reports, iron-containing products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can cause injury, including serious injury, and death when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
children gain access to these products. FDA finds from these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data that the potential for harm exists for all three types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iron-containing products available, i.e., multi-vitamin/mineral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplements that contain iron, iron supplements, and iron-containing drugs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Supporting this finding are the data cited in Tables 1, 2, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 3 that show that, since 1983, at least 40 deaths have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attributed to the accidental ingestion of iron supplements and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iron-containing drugs, and that, since 1986, nearly 190 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
poisonings that were life threatening or that resulted in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permanent injury, and over 2,000 poisonings requiring some form 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of treatment, have resulted from accidental ingestion of adult 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iron-containing products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Further support is provided by the data in the CPSC case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports, which show 80 ingestions of iron leading to hospital 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emergency room visits with varying types of injury, including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vomiting, lethargy, diarrhea, and elevated serum iron (see Table 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The data in Tables 4 and 6 show that in several documented 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
poisoning incidents, children have ingested 30, 40, 50, or more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tablets of iron-containing products when these amounts of tablets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were accessible. Aside from the potential for such ingestion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iron-containing supplements and drugs to be fatal, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consequences of ingesting even multi-vitamin/mineral type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products in these amounts is evident from Table 8. This table 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shows that an amount of iron that may produce symptoms of iron 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
poisoning (i.e., 25 mg/kg) can be ingested by a 10 kg child if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the child consumes 25 tablets containing 10 mg of iron each or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately 14 tablets containing 18 mg each. (Ten mg and 18 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mg of iron are the amounts typically contained in multi-vitamin/mineral supplements with iron including children's

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vitamins.) Based upon the data in Tables 4 and 6, ingestion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this many tablets is not atypical. Thus, FDA finds that injury 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can result anytime a small child is able to gain access to even 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the lowest potency iron-containing products available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Further, the fact that over 2,000 reported poisoning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incidents of varying severity have been recorded in recent years 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Tables 2 and 3), and the fact that AAPCC reports that accidental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iron poisoning is presently the leading cause of pediatric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
poisoning deaths, lead FDA to find that pediatric iron poisonings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have occurred, and continue to occur, with significant frequency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, FDA finds that the fact that these poisonings continue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to occur, even though there have been over 40 deaths from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accidental iron ingestion (See Table 1), strongly suggests that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
many adults are not aware of the potential for serious harm or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
death in young children from accidental ingestion of iron-containing products. Support for this finding is provided
by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statements made by the parents of the victims in several of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
poisoning incidents, described in the case reports obtained from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CPSC as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (1) ``The mother stated that she thought the pills (prenatal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iron pills) were just vitamins and would not harm the victim'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

about the possible ingestion of iron tablets'' (Ref. 22, case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report No. 73). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, as stated above, the data presented by the AG 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petition show that few, if any, of the commonly available iron-containing products have carried label statements
using terms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such as ``WARNING'' or ``CAUTION.'' Because these terms are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
universally accepted as connoting danger, they could be expected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to promote awareness among adults of the danger that these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products pose to young children and of the importance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preventing children from gaining access to these products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, because the data demonstrate that: (1) Iron-containing products of all types can cause injury or death
when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small children gain access to them, (2) more than 2,000

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) many adults are not aware of the potential for serious harm 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
posed by iron-containing products, FDA tentatively concludes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it should require label warning statements for iron-containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products to ensure that adults are fully informed as to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

FDA's legal authority to require label warning

statements on foods.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FDA's authority to require label warning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statements on food products derives from sections 201(n), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
403(a)(1), and 701(a) of the act (21 U.S.C. 321(n), 343(a)(1), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 371(a)). Under section 403(a)(1) of the act, a food is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular. Section 201(n) of the act states, ``If an article 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e.g., a food product) is alleged to be misbranded because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labeling or advertising is misleading, then in determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether the labeling or advertising is misleading there shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taken into account (among other things) not only representations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made or suggested by statement, word, design, device, or any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combination thereof, but also the extent to which the labeling or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advertising fails to reveal facts material in the light of such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representations or material with respect to consequences which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may result from the use of the article to which the labeling or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advertising relates under the conditions of use prescribed in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labeling or advertising thereof or under such conditions of use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as are customary or usual.'' These statutory provisions, combined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with section 701(a) of the act, which grants the agency authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to promulgate regulations for the efficient enforcement of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
act, clearly authorize FDA to promulgate a regulation designed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that persons using iron-containing multi-vitamin/mineral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products and iron supplements will receive information that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material with respect to consequences that may result from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of the product under its labeled conditions or under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions that are customary or usual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA requires label warning statements on certain types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protein products represented for use in reducing weight. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency adopted this requirement in response to a series of sudden 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deaths of individuals, mostly young women, who consumed high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protein, very low calorie diets (&sect;101.70(d)(21 CFR 101.17(d)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Use of such diets was intended to achieve rapid weight loss. As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a result of these deaths, which occurred in the late 1970's, FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promulgated the warning requirement for such products to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that users of these products are aware of the potential adverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consequences of very low calorie protein diets, to indicate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessity for appropriate medical supervision for persons on such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diets, and to identify individuals, i.e., infants, children, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pregnant or nursing women, who should not use these products (49 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, Food Drug Cosm. L. Rep. (CCH) &para; 38,057 (D.D.C. 1980). In that case, the plaintiff asserted that the fatal consequences
arising from the use of dry, whole protein products while dieting were not the result of the customary or usual use of
these products, but rather, the result of unusual misuse of such products. Based on FDA's showing that the consumption
of dry protein products could occur in the course of a diet, and that, under certain circumstances in dieting, serious
adverse effects could arise from such use of these products, the court found that FDA properly invoked sections 201(n),
403(a)(1), and 701(a) of the act to impose a requirement that manufacturers warn consumers of the consequences that
could result from the use of such products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The facts presented by the evidence on iron poisonings parallel those that led the agency to require a warning on protein
products. The use of iron-containing products in households where children are present is in no way an unusual practice.
Multi-vitamin/mineral supplements with iron are routinely taken by children, and products of this type specifically
intended for use by children are widely available and commonly sold. Iron supplements and adult vitamin/mineral
supplements with iron are frequently taken by pregnant women (often with a prescription) and other women of child-bearing
age because they require more iron than other adults (see discussion in section I.A. of this document). Yet, the evidence
on poisonings and deaths shows that the use of any type of iron-containing product in such households can readily lead
to accidental injury or death if children gain access to the products, even though the products are not intended to
be used by children or to be taken in the numbers in which iron-containing tablets or capsules are consumed when poisonings
occur. Thus,

poisoning from iron-containing food products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon FDA's authority under sections 201(n), 403(a)(1), and 701(a) of the act, the agency proposes to require
that manufacturers of iron-containing dietary supplements (i.e., children's and adult's multi-vitamin/mineral
supplements that contain iron and products intended for use as iron supplements) disclose information about their
products in the form of a label warning statement that would appear on such products in the manner described below.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
c. FDA's legal authority to require label warning statements for drugs
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The act authorizes FDA to regulate the marketing of drug products to ensure that such products are properly labeled.
To carry out the public health protection purposes of the act, FDA, among other things, monitors drug labeling to ensure
that it provides accurate information about drug products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 502(a) of the act (21 U.S.C. 352), a drug product is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading
in any particular. The provisions of section 201(n) of the act concerning failure of the labeling to reveal material
facts are applicable to drugs as well as to foods in determining whether labeling is misleading. In addition, under
sections 505(d) and (e) of the act (21 U.S.C. 355(d) and (e)), FDA must refuse to approve a new drug application, and
may withdraw approval for a product, if the product's labeling is false or misleading in any particular.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These statutory provisions, together with section 701(a) of the act, clearly authorize FDA to promulgate a regulation
designed to ensure that patients using drugs will receive information that is material with respect to consequences
that may result from the use of a product. (See

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The act also authorizes FDA to regulate the marketing of drug products to ensure that such products are safe and effective
for their intended uses. Iron-containing drug products are not safe for their intended use as currently labeled,
in part because the labeling fails to warn of iron-containing products' toxic effects in children. Adults are, therefore,
not aware of the need to prevent children from ingesting these products. Because the labeling fails to warn adequately
that these products may produce toxic effects in children, iron-containing products are not being used as intended;
that is, even though they are not intended for children, they are handled in a way that permits their ingestion by children.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The act anticipates that new information about the safety or effectiveness of marketed drugs may require changes
in labeling to reflect necessary limitations on use or to warn of previously unanticipated hazards (see e.g., 21 U.S.C.
355(e)). FDA has required by regulation that manufacturers provide warning statements for specific drug products
(e.g., drugs for internal use which contain mineral oil, 21 CFR 201.302; isoproterenol inhalation preparations,
21 CFR 201.305; acetophenetidin (phenacetin)-containing preparations, 21 CFR 201.309). The impetus for requiring
warnings for each of these products or product classes was evidence of risk in a specific patient population or from
a specific use of the product. FDA responded to these risks by requiring warnings to help patients use prescription
drug products more safely and effectively. For example, given the particular risk of severe paradoxical bronchoconstriction
associated with repeated, excessive use of isoproterenol inhalation preparations, FDA requires that warning information
to patients be included as part of the label and as part of the instructions included in the package dispensed to patients
(See 21 CFR 201.305). The specified warning statement may be placed on the immediate container with a statement to
the pharmacist not to remove it or may be included in a package with instructions to pharmacists to place the warning
on the container prior to dispensing (see 21 CFR 201.305(c)(2)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon FDA's authority under sections 201(n), 502(a), 505 and 701(a) of the act, the agency is proposing to require
that manufacturers of prescription iron-containing products disclose information about the risks presented by
their products in the form of a warning statement that would appear on such products in the manner described below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
What should the label warning be required to state? 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has considered what information should be required in the warning statement to ensure that, as required by sections
201(n), 403(a)(1), 502(a), and 505 of the act, users of iron-containing products are made aware of the potential consequences
of their use, i.e., that the labeling of iron-containing products states the facts that are material with respect
to the consequences that may result from the use of these products. The proposed warning statements in the AG and NDMA
petitions contained the various information elements as shown in Table 9. FDA tentatively concludes that to fulfill
the requirements of the act, the warning statement should incorporate some elements from both of these petitions,
as well as other elements that are designed to ensure that the statement performs its function. In reaching this tentative
conclusion, FDA considered several factors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA agrees with the AG petition that the term ``Warning'' is necessary to alert the user to the potential consequences
of the use of the product, that is, to the dangers of iron overdose. This term is universally accepted as denoting danger.
FDA tentatively concludes that the potential for iron-containing products to cause death or serious injury any time
a small child gains access to the product warrants the use of this term. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA tentatively concludes that the statement must bear the instruction to ``Keep away from children.'' Because a
child is at risk of serious injury or death any time he or she gains access to iron-containing products, this statement
is a material fact about the consequences of use of the product and is also necessary to ensure the safe use of the product.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA also recognizes that the warning needs to be crafted to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflect the type of packaging used. Iron-containing products may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be packaged in unit-dose packages, e.g., blister packs, or in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containers with closures, e.g., a bottle with a cap. FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tentatively concludes that for iron-containing products packaged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in unit-dose packages, the warning statement should include the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instruction ``Keep in original package until each use.'' This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement instructs the user not to misuse the product by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removing more dosage units from their individual packs than will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be ingested at one time. This instruction is important because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such misuse can result in poisoning if children gain access to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the dosage units that have been removed from their original 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
packaging. This instruction was not specifically requested by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any of the petitions. Because some incidents of pediatric iron 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
poisoning have occurred after adults removed multiple dosage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
units from their original containers and stored them in nonchild-resistant vessels (see section I.C. of this document),
however, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the agency tentatively concludes that this statement is necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to ensure that the product is properly used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency concurs with the NDMA petition that the statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Close Tightly'' should be included in the warning statement for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containers with closures. Such a statement provides information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on how to maintain the child-resistance of the container. FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finds that this message is a material fact. FDA bases this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finding, in part, on the fact that some incidents of iron 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
poisoning have occurred even though the product was in child-resistant packaging. Children were able to gain access
to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iron products because the child-resistant closure was not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properly secured (See section I.C. of this document). Thus, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that iron-containing products are used safely, the child-resistance of the packaging must be maintained,
and FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tentatively concludes that inclusion of the statement ``Close 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tightly'' is necessary to ensure that condition of use is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA also tentatively concludes that the label must include the information ``Contains iron, which can harm or cause
death to a child.'' This statement informs the user or the serious and potentially life-threatening nature of the
consequences that can occur when a child ingests an uncontrolled amount of these products.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA also tentatively concludes that the label must state: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``If a child accidentally swallows this product, call a doctor or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a poison control center immediately.'' FDA agrees with the NDMA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petition that treatment-oriented information should be included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the label because it informs attending persons in a poisoning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incident of the need to take immediate action that could save the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
child's life and about what that action should be. Thus, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relates directly to the consequences of use of the product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA does not believe that the warning statement should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based upon or contain information relating to the potency of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iron product (i.e., different statements for products above and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
below 30 mg per dosage unit as requested by the AG petition, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference to ``large doses'' of iron as a factor in determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether poisoning may occur). The agency tentatively finds that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such statements could cause members of the public to attempt to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine whether a large dose has been taken in a possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
poisoning incident. Because most people are not capable of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining what dosage of iron may be nontoxic, toxic, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capable of causing serious harm or death, qualified medical or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
poison control personnel should determine the significance of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dose a child has ingested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nor does there appear to be any reason to require that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement include reference to the specific types of consequences 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that may arise from acute overdosage, i.e., nausea, vomiting, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cardiovascular collapse, as requested by the AG petition. FDA does not believe that this information would materially
add to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the label statement that overdose can cause harm or death, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fears that it may lead to the erroneous conclusion that, because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a child does not exhibit one of the listed symptoms, the child is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not in danger. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
How should the warning appear on the label? 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA agrees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the AGs' contention that the warning statement should appear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prominently on the label of iron-containing products to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectively convey its message. Further, the act specifically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires, in sections 403(f) and 502(c), that information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to appear on the label of a food or a drug be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prominently placed and appear with such conspicuousness, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compared with other printed matter, as to render it likely to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
read by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the AG petition provided no evidence to support the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific presentation elements that it requested for the warning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement, i.e., that it be boxed, in boldface type, and in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
color that contrasts with the background and with other printed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material on the label or labeling. The agency is not aware of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any basis on which it can conclude that any of these specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elements are necessary to ensure that the statement appears on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the label in a prominent and conspicuous manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, in the agency's rulemaking that mandated warning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statements on certain protein products, the agency decided not to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandate specific requirements for letter size and other format 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elements. However, the agency did require that the warning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement appear ``prominently and conspicuously on the principal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
display panel of the package label'' (21 CFR 101.17). FDA made a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination to give manufacturers flexibility to design their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
own label warning formats, while ensuring that the statement is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prominent and conspicuous, so that consumers are given adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice of the information contained in the warning (47 FR 25379 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at 25382, June 11, 1982). In addressing the placement of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
label warning, the agency noted that the seriousness and nature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the risk associated with the use of protein products in very 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
low calorie diets was sufficient to require placement of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warning statement on the principal display panel (49 FR 13679 at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13689). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 201(k) of the act defines the term ``label'' as ``a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
display of written, printed, or graphic matter upon the immediate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
container of any article'' and further states that a requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``that any word, statement, or other information appear on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
label shall not be considered to be complied with unless such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
word, statement, or other information also appears on the outside 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
container or wrapper if any there be, of the retail package of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such article&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*.'' Thus, if FDA requires a label warning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement to appear on the immediate container of iron-containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products, it would also have to appear on the retail package of such a product if that package is not the immediate container.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated above, the fact that iron-containing products have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resulted in reports of 2,000 poisonings in children over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately 7 years provides evidence that many adults are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aware of the potential for serious harm posed by iron-containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. Based on this fact, FDA tentatively finds that there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are sufficient grounds to require that the label warning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement be printed directly on the immediate container of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product, i.e., the container that holds the tablet or capsule, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and on the principal display panel of the retail package, i.e., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an outer box, if such package is not the immediate container 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(many iron-containing products are packaged in this manner). If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a product is sold in unit-dose packaging, this requirement will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mean that the product will have to bear the warning directly on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each unit-dose package or on a strip of unit-dose packages in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such a way that separating the unit dose packages would not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
destroy the warning labeling.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
display panel of the retail package will make it likely that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warning statement will be seen at the time the product is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchased. The statement will inform the purchaser of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product's potential to cause poisoning and of the need to keep 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the product away from children when it is brought into the house. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA tentatively concludes that placement of the warning statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the principal display panel is necessary to fulfill the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement of sections 403(f) and 502(c) of the act, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information required to appear on the label of a food or a drug be placed with conspicuousness (as compared with other
printed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
matter) as to render it likely to be read by the ordinary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual under customary conditions of use. Moreover, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
placement of the warning statement on the principal display panel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is consistent with the requirement that FDA established for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protein product warning statements discussed previously. In both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cases, the products in question could cause serious, even life-threatening, problems if misused. Thus, FDA tentatively

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concludes that the standard of conspicuousness established in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protein products case should also be adopted for iron-containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency tentatively concludes that placement of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warning statement on the immediate container is also necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fulfill the requirement of sections 403(f) and 502(c) of the act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because, under customary conditions of use, the retail container 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is frequently disposed of, and individuals other than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchaser may use the product. Therefore, the warning statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be printed on the immediate container if this statement is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to perform its function throughout the life of the product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulating the placement of the warning is consistent with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other labeling requirements that the agency has imposed. In 21 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CFR 201.314(h)(1) and (h)(2), FDA has required that the labeling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of orally or rectally administered aspirin and aspirin-containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drug products intended for sale without prescription bear a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warning that reads: ``WARNING: Children and teenagers should not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use this medicine for chicken pox or flu symptoms before a doctor is consulted about Reye syndrome, a rare but serious
illness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reported to be associated with aspirin.'' The warning must appear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the immediate container labeling. In cases where the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediate container is not the retail package, the retail package 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must also bear the warning statement. (see 51 FR 8180, March 7, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1986).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA tentatively concludes that the objectives of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulation regarding the packaging and labeling of iron-containing products will be best met if the agency
requires that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed warnings appear on the immediate container. In case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the strip packaging or individual unit-dose packages are removed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the box in which they are sold to the consumer, or in case a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strip of unit-dose packages is transferred by a pharmacist to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vial, each unit-dose package, or strip of unit dose packages, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would bear the warning that FDA considers essential to the safe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of these products. The warning would remind adults not to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remove the iron-containing products from the unit-dose package. In addition, it would ensure that each time an adult
takes one of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these products, he or she is reminded of the danger that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product poses to children. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 01 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, if the warning accompanies each tablet or group 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of tablets, an adult who finds a child eating the product will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
know to call for help immediately and will know, when asked by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health care professional, that the ingested tablets contain iron. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 01 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is not proposing specific requirements for the graphics 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e.g., type size, bold type) of the warning statement but is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing to require that the label warning appear prominently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and conspicuously on the immediate container of the product and on the principal display panel of the retail package,
so that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumers are given adequate notice of the information contained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the warning. These proposed requirements for the warning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement are consistent with the requirement FDA established for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protein products. FDA tentatively concludes that they will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectively achieve, through placement rather than graphical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements, the objective sought by the AG petition of reaching 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumers who have no knowledge of iron's hazards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 01 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If FDA adopts the regulations that it is proposing, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers will have the flexibility, as requested in the NDMA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petition, to design their own label and warning notice formats. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is requesting comments on the most efficient way to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that warnings on the immediate container will accompany 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
every tablet until the time it is used. Suggestions about the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
placement and design of unit-dose packaging that can best 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accommodate the required warnings are invited. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 01 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA also specifically solicits comments on whether the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general requirement that the label warning appear prominently and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conspicuously on the label is adequate. Should the agency more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
explicitly define in its regulation the level of prominence and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conspicuousness that it expects? If so, what should the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require? The agency notes, for example, that in a final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that required a new warning on Reye syndrome for aspirin, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically stated that the requirement of ``prominence'' in its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations meant that manufacturers of aspirin and aspirin-containing drug products had to use an attention-getting

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement, such as ``see new warning'' on the label for at least 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year (53 FR 21633, 21635, June 9, 1988). Similarly, in the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule on nutrition labeling that FDA adopted in response to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990, FDA specified a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of format elements to ensure that the nutrition facts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
label would be readily observable and comprehensible (see 58 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2079, January 6, 1993). FDA requests comments on whether, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that the warning statement will have its intended effect, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the agency should specify more completely how the warning should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be presented on iron-containing products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Proposed Labeling Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Having tentatively concluded that label warning statements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be required on iron-containing products, and having 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluated the information that the warning statement should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include, FDA is proposing to amend its regulations by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adding new &sect;101.17(e) for foods, and new &sect;310.55 for drugs, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require label warning statements for iron-containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products offered in solid oral dosage form. As noted above, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under these proposed regulations, the warning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement that must be used will depend upon how the product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is packaged. For products that are packaged in unit-dose packaging (e.g., blister packs) the agency is proposing
to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require the following warning: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
WARNING_Keep away from children. Keep in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
original package until each use. Contains 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iron, which can harm or cause death to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
child. If a child accidentally swallows this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product, call a doctor or poison control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
center immediately.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this proposal, this warning statement will be required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for all iron-containing products packaged in unit-dose packaging. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, it would be required to appear: (1) On the labeling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of products containing 30 mg or more iron per dosage unit, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are subject to the proposed requirement for unit-dose packaging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described below (see section III.B. of this document); and (2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the labeling of products that contain less than 30 mg iron per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dosage unit but that are packaged voluntarily in unit-dose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
packaging. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For products that contain less than 30 mg iron per dosage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit and that are packaged in any form of packaging other than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit-dose packaging, e.g., containers with child-resistant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closures, the agency is proposing to require the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warning:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
WARNING_Close tightly and keep away from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
children. Contains iron, which can harm or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cause death to a child. If a child 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accidentally swallows this product, call a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
doctor or poison control center immediately.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency may conduct focus group research to evaluate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer understanding of the proposed warning messages and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that the messages are not misleading. Focus group 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
research involves gathering small, representative groups of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumers (no more than nine consumers per group) and leading 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
then in a directed discussion of the research topic. For the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present research, consumers will provide feedback as to their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level of understanding of the warnings and the degree to which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the specific wording of the messages is believable, relevant, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confusing, or irritating. The agency intends to consider the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results of the focus group research in arriving at any warning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement that is included in the final regulations. FDA will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make a report on the results of its research available for public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment before it issues the final regulations.

B. Packaging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Review of Packaging Issues in Citizen Petitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two of the citizen petitions suggested that FDA take action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with respect to the packaging of iron-containing drugs and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dietary supplements. Both petitions recommended packaging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements as a means of reducing pediatric poisonings from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingestion of multiple doses of drugs and dietary supplements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing 30 mg or more iron per dosage unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AG citizen petition requested that FDA use its authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the act to require that all iron-containing drugs and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dietary supplements containing 30 mg or more iron per dosage unit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be packaged in child-resistant blister packs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NDMA petition recommended that FDA incorporate into its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations the NDMA-initiated voluntary program to address 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pediatric poisonings by such iron-containing products. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
voluntary program includes, in part, a proviso that all iron-containing products currently subject to CPSC's special
packaging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations that contain 30 mg or more of iron per dosage unit be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
packaged in CRP's, and that there be no exemption to CPSC's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
child-resistant special packaging requirements for these types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. As discussed previously, NDMA's voluntary program also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifies labeling statements and includes an educational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program. Implicit in NDMA's recommendation is the view that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CRC's, labeling warning statements, and consumer education 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs are sufficient to ensure the safe use of iron-containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Agency Response 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA considered the following questions in evaluating and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responding to the packaging issues raised in the citizen 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petitions: (1) Can educational efforts and label warning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statements alone sufficiently reduce pediatric iron poisonings? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Are noncomplying child-resistant packages a principal cause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of iron poisoning deaths? (3) Are additional packaging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements necessary to ensure the safe use of certain iron-containing products? (4) What is FDA's legal authority
to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulate packaging for foods and drugs? (5) Should child-resistant blister packaging be required for iron-containing

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Can educational efforts and label warning statements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significantly reduce pediatric iron poisonings? 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA agrees with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NDMA that educating consumers on the proper use of CRC's and on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the hazards posed by iron-containing drugs and supplements is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
very important. However, based on the available evidence, even 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if all CRC's were properly used, these closures could not have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevented the majority of the 37 reported fatalities. Improper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of CRC's was reported in only 4 of the 21 (19 percent) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pediatric iron fatalities known to involve child-resistant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
packaging (Table 2). Educational programs and label warning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statements should help to increase proper use of reclosable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CRC's, and thereby help to prevent some pediatric iron-poisonings. However, FDA knows of no information showing
that a consumer education program, either that recommended by NDMA or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any other such program, will be adequate to ensure that children 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not be able to defeat even properly closed CRC's, or that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improper use of such closures will cease. In the absence of such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information, FDA believes that measures beyond consumer education 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs are necessary to ensure that the use of certain iron-containing products is safe. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA also tentatively finds that label warning statements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not be sufficient to ensure the safe use of these products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This tentative conclusion is based on the fact that label warning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statements do not in any way bar access to the product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Label statements are an important educational tool for making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adults aware of the significant consequences for young children 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if they gain access to the product. Young children, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however, cannot read and have little judgment. Thus, a warning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement is likely to have little or no effect on their efforts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to gain access.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The available data show that poisonings are occurring in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
large measure because of the efforts of children. Table 4 shows 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that in 9 of the 21 reported pediatric poisoning deaths that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involved iron-containing products packaged in containers with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CRC's, the victims gained access to multiple doses of iron-containing product by their own efforts or through the
efforts of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
another child. Most of these children were under 51 months of age. Thus, a label warning statement is unlikely to have
any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meaning or significance to them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA requests comments on its tentative conclusion that label 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warning statements are not sufficient to ensure that the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain iron-containing products will be safe. Comments that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bear on the effectiveness of labeling warning statements to deter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
young children from directly gaining access to these products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be most compelling if they contain supporting data and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated above, FDA believes that label warning statements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will help to reduce the incidence of pediatric poisoning because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they will ensure that adults are aware of the pediatric toxicity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of iron and will encourage responsible adults to properly reclose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and store iron-containing products. However, FDA is concerned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that warning statements alone will not prevent the misuse of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CRP's that has contributed to the epidemic of iron poisonings of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
children. FDA notes that CRP's themselves are a de facto warning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the contents of the package present hazards for children. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Yet, in 21 of the 26 pediatric poisoning deaths in which the type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of packaging was reported, the product was packaged in containers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with CRC's (Table 4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the effectiveness of label warning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statements is generally considered to be dependent on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
several factors including, but not necessarily limited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to: The personal relevance of the warning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information; familiarity with the warning information; perceived hazard from the product; and desensitization
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habituation to warnings after repeated exposures (Ref. 24). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, a report on the effectiveness of a labeling and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
educational program to prevent pediatric poisonings from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accidental ingestion of prescription drugs shows that labeling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and educational programs are not always sufficient to prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pediatric poisonings, and that, in some instances, additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
packaging safeguards are necessary to ensure the safe use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain substances (Ref. 25). Therefore, FDA tentatively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concludes that label warning statements will not be sufficient to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure the safe use of certain iron-containing products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

FDA finds that iron-containing drugs and dietary supplements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pose a unique hazard to young children. The pediatric hazard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presented by these products is directly related to their iron 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
content. As discussed above in section I.B. of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
document, ingestion of 25 mg or more iron per kg of body weight 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is considered a toxic dose, and ingestion of 100 to 200 mg iron 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per kg of body weight can be lethal. Once a potentially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lethal dose of iron has been ingested and absorbed, medical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intervention to halt the toxic progression of iron poisoning is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difficult and often unsuccessful. Successful treatment for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iron poisoning is determined primarily by the amount of iron 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingested and how rapidly medical intervention occurs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the risk of pediatric iron poisonings with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
irreversible and potentially fatal consequences that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presented by higher potency iron-containing products, and of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inherent limitations on the effectiveness of labeling and educational programs, FDA tentatively concludes that
it would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inappropriate to rely solely on these measures to ensure the safe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of these products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Are noncomplying CRP's a principal cause of iron 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
poisoning deaths? 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NDMA contends that new packaging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements beyond those outlined in its petition are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to reduce the incidence of pediatric iron poisonings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NDMA petition asserts that the available data on pediatric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iron-poisonings are deficient to the extent that it cannot be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined whether products associated with the poisonings were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
packaged in compliance with CPSC's packaging requirements, and it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggests that iron-containing products packaged in noncompliant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CRP's are the principle cause of pediatric iron-poisonings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, NDMA provided no information to support its view. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has carefully examined the available information on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pediatric iron poisonings and could find no evidence to support 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the NDMA's contention that the iron-containing products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with these poisonings were packaged in CRP's that did 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not comply with regulations established by CPSC. In the absence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of such evidence, FDA can find no basis on which to conclude that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliant, child-resistant special packaging is the primary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cause of pediatric iron-poisonings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Are additional packaging requirements appropriate? 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tentatively concludes that full compliance with CPSC's CRP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements, even if there are warning statements in labeling of iron-containing products and appropriate educational
programs, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not be adequate to ensure the safe use of certain iron-containing drugs and dietary supplements if bottle and
closure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
packaging were to continue as the predominant means of packaging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such products. FDA recognizes that each of these measures either 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has been successful in limiting the number of poisonings or can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be reasonably expected to be effective in reducing the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
poisonings. However, given the potentially fatal outcome that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can result from pediatric iron-poisoning, FDA is not persuaded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that these measures are adequate to ensure the safety of the use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of certain iron-containing drugs and dietary supplements. FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tentatively concludes that to reduce the incidence of pediatric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iron poisonings to a level that would permit the agency to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conclude that there is a reasonable certainty of no harm from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of these products, it is necessary to require a specific type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of physical barrier to access these products. Therefore, FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tentatively concludes that additional packaging requirements are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA requests comments on this tentative conclusion. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency is particularly interested in receiving comments that bear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the effectiveness of different types of packaging to limit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pediatric access to toxic amounts of iron. Comments will be most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
persuasive if they are supported by studies and other data and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information.

Consideration of legal authority of FDA and other

agencies to require specific packaging measures for foods and

drugs. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its consideration of what action to take concerning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the packaging of iron-containing drugs and dietary supplements to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure their safe use, FDA recognized that it must act within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limits of its statutory authority and consider the statutory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority of other government agencies. As noted above, under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the PPPA, CPSC has authority to regulate the packaging of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household substances. Under the PPPA, CPSC can establish special 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
packaging performance standards. Thus, by regulation, CPSC has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established special packaging standards and performance criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for special packaging, 16 CFR 1700.15 and 1700.20, respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the PPPA specifically limits CPSC from establishing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations that require specific packaging designs, product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
content, and package quantity for household substances, including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
food and drugs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
act provides FDA with broad authority to ensure that food is safe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and wholesome. In particular, the act prohibits the adulteration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of food in sections 301 and 402 (21 U.S.C. 331 and 342) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires, in sections 409(a) (21 U.S.C. 348(a)) and 402(a)(2)(C), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that all food additives be listed for use by FDA before they are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
added to food. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In section 409(a), the act deems a food additive to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unsafe unless its use conforms to the conditions specified in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listing regulation. These conditions include, but are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited to, specifications as to the particular food or classes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of food to which the additive may be added, as to the manner in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the additive may be added to such food, and any directions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or other labeling or packaging requirements for such additive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deemed necessary to ensure the safety of such use (section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
409(c)(1)(A) of the act. Thus, under the act, the agency is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorized to specify packaging requirements for a food additive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when it finds that use of such packaging is necessary to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the safe use of the additive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In section 201(s), the act provides an exemption to the food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additive definition for substances that are generally recognized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as safe (GRAS) under the conditions of their intended use. FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has issued regulations delineating conditions under which use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain substances is GRAS. If the conditions of a particular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of a substance are not those that are generally recognized as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safe, the use is not GRAS, but subject to regulation under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
food additives provisions of the act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Should FDA determine that a particular type of packaging is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to ensure the safe use of iron substances in dietary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplements, either as GRAS substances or as listed food additives, then any use of iron substances in dietary supplements

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that does not involve use of that type of packaging would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constitute a use of an unapproved food additive and render the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dietary supplements adulterated under the act.

Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
501(a)(2)(B) of the act (21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B)) states that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drug shall be deemed to be adulterated if the methods used in, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the facilities or controls used for, its manufacture, processing, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
packing, or holding do not conform to, or are not operated or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administered in conformity with, current good manufacturing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practice to assure that such drug meets the requirements of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
act as to safety and has the identity and strength, and meets the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality and purity characteristics, which it purports or is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
represented to possess. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A drug product may be safe and effective as manufactured but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used in an unsafe and ineffective manner. Current good 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturing practice is, to some extent, an evolving standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To remain ``current,'' a manufacturer must take into account 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advances in technology as well as new information about the use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the product including, but not limited to, information about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any dangers associated with use of the drug product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers must use this knowledge to alter, adapt, or change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their manufacturing procedures to ensure that all possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measures have been implemented to eliminate known dangers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, advances in technology and new information about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dangers associated with a drug product can mean that further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
steps by the manufacturer are necessary to guard against such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foreseeable dangers, in order to hold the drug product in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manner that ensures its safety and, thus, comports with current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
good manufacturing practice.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has promulgated regulations to ensure that, among other things, drug products are held, pending use by the intended
consumer, in a manner that ensures their safety (Parts 210 and 211 (21 CFR parts 210 and 211)). The term ``held'' includes
not only manufacturing and shipping time, but also the time from point of purchase to consumer use. Thus, manufacturers
are responsible for the manner in which their products are held pending actual consumer use, and they are responsible
if the packaging that they use is not adequate to prevent unintended ingestion of iron by children.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations are replete with examples of FDA's authority to regulate the manufacturer beyond the point of shipping
the product from the manufacturing site. For example, &sect;211.94(b) requires that container closure systems
``provide adequate protection against 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
foreseeable external factors
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in storage and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
use
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that can cause deterioration or contamination of the drug product (emphasis added).'' This regulation requires
that manufacturers protect against deterioration or contamination occurring during storage of drug products throughout
the chain of distribution, up to the point of use by the consumer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 501(a)(2)(B) of the act, manufacturers also are responsible for preventing intentional misuse of
a drug product. In 1982, in response to a series of capsule tamperings, FDA promulgated a regulation (&sect;211.132)
that requires tamper-resistant packaging for all over-the-counter (OTC) human drug products except dermatologics,
dentifrices, and insulin (47 FR 50442). The agency's action assured greater package integrity and product security
beyond the point of manufacture. FDA's authority to require tamper-resistant packaging is found primarily in section
501(a)(2)(B) of the act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Significantly, the health risk that prompted the tamper-resistant packaging regulation was not attributable directly
to manufacturing or packing practices that contravened the current good manufacturing practice regulations in
effect at that time. Rather, despite compliance with existing regulations, drug product quality was compromised
because of previously unforeseeable and unintended intervention by persons other than the consumer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because tamper resistant packaging was a means to obviate a newly apparent danger, and because tamper-resistant
packaging technology was available, current good manufacturing practice mandated that it be used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, in 1989, recognizing the persistent vulnerability of the hard-capsule dosage form, FDA amended the tamper-resistant
regulation to require that OTC products marketed in two-piece, hard-gelatin capsules be packaged using at least
two tamper-resistant features (54 FR 5227, February 2, 1989). Likewise, in 1994, the agency proposed to amend the
tamper-resistant regulation to require that the packages for all OTC human drug products marketed in two-piece,
hard-gelatin capsules be sealed (59 FR 2542, January 18, 1994). The proposed amendment is part of ``the agency's continuing
review of the potential public health threat posed by product tampering,'' and was proposed to ``address specific
vulnerabilities in the OTC market and to improve consumer protection.'' (59 FR 2543). In the preamble to the proposed
rule, FDA recognized that, although the packaging used at the time of the latest poisoning incidents met FDA requirements
in effect at that time, the packaging was not designed to reveal visible evidence of tampering. The proposed rule would
change ``tamper-resistant'' to ``tamper-evident'' to underscore the fact that current packaging technology is
not invulnerable to tampering and would require packaging that not only erects barriers to tampering, but also alerts
the consumer to signs of tampering.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, in September 1993, FDA published a regulation that requires the imprinting of solid oral dosage form
drug products for human use (See 58 FR 47948, September 13, 1993). The regulation requires that every such product
be imprinted with a code that allows identification of the drug product and its manufacturer or distributor. The regulation
will ensure, among other things, that consumers and health care professionals will have this information available
in the event of an emergency. The imprinting rule, like the proposed rule for iron-containing products, responds
to concerns that are related to consumer use of drug products rather than concerns focused on the integrity and composition
of such products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule, therefore, like those pertaining to tamper-evident packaging and drug imprinting, is intended
to enhance the safety of drug products, specifically iron-containing drug products. The recent statistical data
available to FDA demonstrate that the current manner of holding iron-containing drug products until their use by
the intended consumer fails to ensure that the drug products will be safe because large numbers of children are ingesting
such products and suffering serious injuries or death. Existing technology permits additional safeguards, such
as child-resistant blister packs, to be used for holding iron-containing drug products. Given the known dangers
and the ability to minimize or eliminate such dangers through the use of existing technology, FDA tentatively concludes
that current good manufacturing practice dictates that unit-dose packaging be used.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
e. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Should child-resistant blister packaging be required?
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Requiring child-resistant blister packaging of iron-containing drugs and supplements, as recommended by the AG
petition, is one packaging approach to reduce the incidence of pediatric iron-poisoning fatalities. This approach
can be viewed as embodying three distinct packaging components: (1) Require unit-dose packaging; (2) require a specific
type of unit-dose packaging (i.e., blister packs); and (3) require CRP's.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA recognizes that unit-dose packaging provides certain packaging features that reclosable containers do not
provide. Products packaged in unit-dose packaging require that the packaging be opened for each individual dosage
unit. The additional time and effort needed to open each unit restricts the number of doses available for ingestion
during the time that a child has access to the package. In contrast, a multi-dose reclosable package (i.e., a bottle
and closure) allows a child access to all of its contents once the closure is opened. In addition, the effectiveness
of child-resistant unit-dose packaging does not depend upon adults' properly resecuring a cap as is the case with
reclosable CRP's. Therefore, FDA tentatively concludes that unit-dose packaging of products will contribute in
a significant, over and above the protections provided by warning statements and CRP's, to reduce children's access
to potentially fatal doses of product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This tentative conclusion is supported by studies of the pediatric accessibility of products in different types
of conventional (i.e., nonchild resistant) packaging. The results from these studies show that unit-dose packaging,
in comparison to snap type and screw cap closure packaging, will limit access to multiple doses of product by young
children. Studies of pediatric accessibility of product packaged in conventional unit-dose ``pouches,'' conventional
unit-dose ``blister cards,'' and containers with conventional ``snap type'' and ``screw cap'' closures have been
reported. Children, 42 to 51 months old, participated in each of these studies. Results from the study of conventional
pouch packaging show that 55.5 percent of the children (n = 200) were unable to access more than eight tablets in 10 min
(Ref. 26). In a similar study of conventional blister card packaging 64 percent of the children (n = 200) were unable
to access more than eight tablets in 10 min (Ref. 27). In contrast, studies of pediatric accessibility of conventional
``snap type'' and ``continuous threaded type'' packaging show that most young children are able to gain access to
products packaged in these types of conventional packaging in a relatively short period of time. Results from studies
of ``snap type'' packaging show that with upward opening forces of less than 3 lb (average 1.9 lb), 96 percent of the
children (n = 650) were able to open such packaging within 12 to 75 seconds (Ref. 28). Results from studies of pediatric
accessibility of conventional, 33 mm diameter, ``screw type'' packaging and having caps with 2, 4, 6, and 8, torque-inch-pounds
(TIP) rotational closing forces, show that approximately 100 percent of the children (n = 400) were able to open the
packaging within an average of 11 seconds. Fifty-four percent of the children were able to open ``screw type'' packaging
with rotational closing forces of 10 to 25 TIP within 71 seconds (Ref. 29).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, blister packaging is one type of unit-dose packaging. However, FDA does not agree with the AG petition's
contention that blister packaging is necessary to ensure the safe use of iron-containing drugs and supplements.
FDA tentatively finds that requiring a specific type of unit-dose packaging may be more restrictive than necessary
if other types of unit-dose packaging accomplish the same objective. As discussed above, other types of conventional
unit-dose packaging provide a comparable length of time for children to open as that required by conventional blister
packaging.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the child-resistant component of the AG petition's recommendation, FDA notes that CPSC has established
regulations that require CRP's for iron-containing drugs and dietary supplements in packages that contain 250 mg
or more total iron (16 CFR 1700.14(a)(12) and (13)). In addition, CPSC has promulgated regulations for performance
standards to establish the effectiveness of CRP's (16 CFR 1700.20). FDA finds that establishing CRP's standards
for iron-containing drugs and dietary supplements therefore would be redundant and could place an unnecessary regulatory
burden on manufacturers of such iron-containing products. Furthermore, requiring CRP's for all iron-containing
products with 30 mg or more iron per dosage unit would circumvent the intention of the PPPA to allow access by elderly
and handicapped persons who are unable to use such household substances when packaged in compliance with CRP's requirements.
Therefore, FDA is not proposing to separately require CRP's of iron-containing drugs and dietary supplements.

3. Proposed Packaging Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing to amend its regulations to establish safe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions of use for iron-containing products by requiring that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all such products that contain 30 mg or more iron per dosage unit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be packaged in nonreusable, unit-dose packaging. FDA tentatively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concludes that the use of iron and iron salts in products at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potencies at or above 30 mg iron per dosage unit is not safe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(and, therefore, is not GRAS) unless the food to which it is added, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or the drug which contains it, is packaged in a manner that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate to prevent unintended ingestion by children. Thus, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
while iron and several of its salts will continue to be listed as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GRAS under 21 CFR part 182 for use as dietary supplements and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under part 184 (21 CFR part 184) for use as nutrient supplements, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to add &sect;170.55, which will require unit-dose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
packaging when iron or iron salts are used at a level of 30 mg or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more per dosage unit in dietary supplements. Section 170.55 will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also apply to approved food additive uses of iron salts in foods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for special dietary and nutritional uses. Unit-dose packaging of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drug products that contain 30 mg or more of iron per dosage unit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is required under proposed &sect;310.518(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Rationale for requiring unit-dose packaging for iron-containing products with 30 mg or more iron per dosage unit.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is proposing to require unit-dose packaging for iron-containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drugs and supplements with 30 mg or more iron per dosage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit to ensure that the use of these products is safe. FDA's tentative conclusion to use 30 mg per unit-dose as the threshold

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for requiring unit-dose packaging is based on its consideration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a number factors including: (1) The amount of ingested iron 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that can cause pediatric fatality; (2) the amount of ingested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iron that can cause significant iron poisoning; (3) the average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of dosage units associated with pediatric fatalities; (4) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the types and potency of iron-containing products associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pediatric iron poisoning fatalities; (5) information on how 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iron products are sold; and (6) the citizen petitions that were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted to FDA. These factors pointed to the use of 30 mg per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit-dose as a threshold. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, the toxicity of any iron ingestion is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
related to the total amount of iron ingested and absorbed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(section I.B. of this document). Ingestion of 250 mg iron per kg 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of body weight (2.5 g total iron for a 10 kg child) is typically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered to be a lethal dose of iron. However, there have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports of fatalities from ingestion of lesser amounts (less than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2.5 g) of iron, and the available data bear this out. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, Table 5 shows that several pediatric fatalities have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been associated with ingestion of approximately 1 g of iron. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, the amount of iron that can cause serious adverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects is given as 60 mg/kg (section I.B. of this document). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For a 10 kg child this translates to 600 mg of iron. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA recognizes that there is variability among individuals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with respect to the lethal dose of iron. Because of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variability, and because of the variable size and age of children 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at risk, FDA tentatively concludes that, to protect the wide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
range of susceptible children, it is necessary through packaging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measures (unit-dose packaging) to limit pediatric access to iron-containing drugs and dietary supplements at potencies
that can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonably expected to provide 1 g of iron. Restricting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pediatric access to this amount of iron by packaging measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will substantially reduce the potential for a fatal or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant iron poisoning outcome should an accidental pediatric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingestion of iron-containing products occur. As discussed above, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because of the time and effort needed to access products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contained in unit-door packaging, the likelihood that young 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
children will be able to ingest a lethal amount of iron will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significantly reduced, thereby reducing the likelihood that they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be seriously injured or die. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 37 case reports of iron poisoning fatalities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available, the average number of dosage units ingested by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pediatric victim was 39 tablets or capsules, with a range of 5 to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
98 (Table 2). FDA notes that ingestion of 39 tablets or capsules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at potencies of 25 to 30 mg iron per dosage unit is sufficient to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide a potentially lethal dose of iron (i.e., approximately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1,000 mg) to a young child.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As for the types of products that have been involved in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pediatric iron poisonings, none of the 37 pediatric fatalities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was reported to be associated with a multivitamin/mineral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplement product. All of the products reported to be involved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in these fatalities were either single or double nutrient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products that were provided for use as prenatal supplements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Single or double nutrient iron-containing products generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contain 30 mg or more iron per dosage unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As for the potency of the products involved, all of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pediatric fatalities were reported to be associated with iron-containing products at potencies of 40 mg iron or more
per dosage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit. FDA is not aware of any pediatric iron poisoning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fatalities associated with iron-containing products whose potency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was less than 40 mg iron per dosage unit. Moreover, only 1 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 37 pediatric fatalities was reported to be associated with an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iron-containing product that contained less than 60 mg iron per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dosage unit. Thus, FDA observed that requiring unit-dose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
packaging of products that contain 30 mg or more iron per dosage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit will provide about a two-fold margin of safety from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potency of products that have usually been associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pediatric fatalities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information available to the agency shows that products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that contain 30 mg or more iron per dosage unit are primarily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sold to women of childbearing age for prenatal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use. Prenatal iron-containing products may be obtained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as dietary supplements or prescription drug products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA notes that all of the iron-containing products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with the 37 pediatric poisoning fatalities were apparently obtained as prenatal drugs or supplements.
FDA finds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that prenatal iron-containing drugs and supplements present the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greatest potential for pediatric iron poisonings and fatalities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because of their iron content, and because they are likely to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available in households with young children. Prenatal iron-containing products are likely to be in households with
young 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
children either because they remain in the household after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
childbirth, or because young children are present in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household during pregnancy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fourth, FDA notes that both the AG and NDMA citizen 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petitions recommended 30 mg iron per dosage unit as an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate level to establish additional safeguards to reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the incidence of pediatric iron poisonings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, FDA is proposing unit-dose packaging for all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dietary supplements and drugs containing 30 mg or more iron per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dosage unit. FDA tentatively concludes that unit-dose packaging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will reduce the incidence of pediatric poisonings by providing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the additional safeguards necessary to limit pediatric access to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a potentially fatal amount of iron. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b. Practical effect. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed above, CPSC's child-resistant packaging regulations require that any iron-containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drug or dietary supplement packaged in a container with 250 mg or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more iron must be packaged in accordance with their child-resistant packaging regulations (16 CFR 1700.14(a)(12)
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a)(13)). Therefore, FDA anticipates that manufacturers and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distributors of drugs and dietary supplements containing 30 mg or more iron per dosage unit, and containing 250 mg
or more total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iron per package, under this proposed action and CPSC's current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations (16 CFR 1700.14(a)(12) and (a)(13)), a manufacturer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or packer will have the option of packaging the product in child-resistant unit-dose packaging (e.g., child-resistant
blisters, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
child-resistant pouches), or of exercising its right to an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exemption to CPSC's special packaging requirements to allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
access by elderly or handicapped persons. However, under this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule, in the latter case, the products will have to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
packaged in conventional unit-dose packaging and will be subject 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to CPSC's requirements for exempt packaged products (16 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1700.5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA tentatively concludes that, regardless of which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
packaging option a manufacturer or packer uses, unit-dose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
packaging of all iron-containing drugs and supplements that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contain 30 mg or more per dosage unit will ensure the safe use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such products by limiting unintended access to such products by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
young children.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In proposing this action, it is not FDA's intention to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumvent the aim of the PPPA to allow access by elderly and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handicapped persons who may be unable to use such household 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substances when packaged in CRP's. The agency requests comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the effect that this proposed packaging requirement will have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the accessibility of iron-containing drugs and dietary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplements to elderly and handicapped persons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Iron-containing drug products that are removed from and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dispensed in other than unit-dose packaging are adulterated and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misbranded.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In order to be exempt from the requirement in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 502(f)(1) of the act that a drug bear adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directions for use, a prescription drug product for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
human use must bear, among other things, a statement, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directed to the pharmacist, specifying the type of container to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be used in dispensing the drug product to maintain the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product's identity, strength, quality, and purity (21 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
201.100(b)(7)). However, directions for repackaging are ``not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required for prescription drug products packaged in unit-dose, unit-of-use, or other packaging format in which
the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer's original package is designed and intended to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dispensed to patients without repackaging.'' (Id.) If FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ultimately determines that unit-dose packaging is necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure the identity, strength, quality, and purity of iron- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing drug products, the agency would consider such products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are dispensed to consumers in other than unit-dose packaging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be adulterated and misbranded. Products marketed by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer in unit-dose packaging would remain exempt from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement for repackaging instructions because FDA expects that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pharmacists will not compromise such packaging systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has, in certain cases in the past, prohibited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pharmacists from repackaging products because the original 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer's packaging was necessary to ensure the product's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identity, strength, quality, and purity. In 1972, FDA concluded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that improper packaging of nitroglycerin preparations was causing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial loss of potency of the drug. Commonly used plastic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containers and strip packaging failed to prevent appreciable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaporation of nitroglycerin from nitroglycerin tablets. FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that it was necessary to require that these products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be packaged and dispensed in glass containers to ensure the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potency of the product ((37 FR 15859, August 5, 1972); 21 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
250.300 (1973)). In addition, manufacturers were required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include a statement directed to pharmacists that the product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be dispensed only in the original, unopened container (21 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CFR 250.300(b)(1973)).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA revoked the nitroglycerin packaging and labeling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements in 1985 because action taken by FDA and the United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc., after publication of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements, had made them unnecessary and duplicative (50 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7584, February 25, 1985). When it proposed to revoke the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation, FDA observed that the U.S.P. monograph for sublingual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nitroglycerin tablets duplicated most of the packaging and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labeling requirements that initially had been set forth in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule (49 FR 24031, June 11, 1984). In addition, FDA found that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the suitability of any packaging not in conformance with the rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or the monograph under CGMP regulations would have to be shown to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA by adequate data (id.). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Like the nitroglycerin regulation, this proposed regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding iron-containing products is intended to address a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public health problem that, FDA has tentatively concluded, can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alleviated by requiring specific packaging. As was the case with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nitroglycerin before FDA required specific packaging, iron- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing products are not safe as currently packaged. FDA has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tentatively determined that it is necessary to prohibit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repackaging by pharmacists in order to protect product integrity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and to provide the greatest assurance that iron-containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products will be used safely and as intended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA recognizes that pregnant women can receive their iron 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplements by way of third-party reimbursement, which generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires that a health care professional prescribe the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplements. These women present their prescriptions to pharmacists who, often, repackage iron dietary supplements
in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pharmacy vials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA recognizes the vital importance of iron supplements to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prenatal health care and emphasizes that the proposed rule should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not diminish the availability of iron tablets to pregnant women 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or to any other patient population. FDA expects that pharmacists 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will dispense the tablets in their original unit-dose packaging. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed rule, pharmacists would be free to dispense 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iron-containing products in the manufacturer's box, or in any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other outer container, as long as the original unit-dose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
packaging remained intact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA does not believe that the proposed mandatory packaging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and labeling regulation will encroach upon the practice of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pharmacy. Under the proposed requirement, products will reach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the pharmacy in unit-dose packaging with a warning statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
printed directly on the immediate wrapping or container. FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tentatively concludes that such a requirement, rather than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representing an encroachment on the practice of pharmacy, is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to ensure that consumers receive adequate warning about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the serious dangers associated with the use of iron-containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drugs.

IV. Other Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Formulation and Appearance of Iron-Containing Products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The AG petition recommended that FDA prohibit the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacture and sale of adult formulations of iron-containing products that look like candy or contain a sweet outer
coating. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AAPCC petition asked FDA to urge the industry to voluntarily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reformulate iron-containing products containing 30 mg or more of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iron per dosage unit to be in less attractive dosage units, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically avoiding resemblance to popular candies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NDMA asked FDA to reject the recommendation from the AG 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petition for several reasons. First, NDMA stated that ``candy can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be_and is_made to look like just about any other consumable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product. Once a supplement manufacturer decides on a shape, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
size, color_of which there are limited selections_for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplement product, a candy manufacturer could choose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
independently to introduce a candy that looks like that dietary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplement.'' Second, NDMA stated that it is not known what a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pill looks like to a very young child. ``A very young child puts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
everything into his or her mouth, and in fact there are no hard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data to say that candy-like appearance is why a very young child 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chooses to investigate a consumable consumer product. It is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quite likely that it may be even more important that the very 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
young child sees his or her mother take that pill every day.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, NDMA asserted that candy-like appearance is in the eye of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the beholder and is simply too subjective a standard. It would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be impossible to have an objective measure of candy-like 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appearance. Thus, NDMA stated that any provision for ``no candy- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
like appearance'' would not be practical and would be difficult to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administer because of the subjective nature of assessing candy-like appearance.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency does not have data or other information specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the question of how a candy-like appearance may contribute to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the potential for an iron-containing supplement product to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constitute a hazard to a young child. FDA's tentative view, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however, is that it may not be possible to objectively measure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the candy-like appearance of iron-containing products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, FDA requests comments on the use of ``candy'' and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``colorful'' coatings on iron-containing drugs and dietary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplements and information on whether these types of coatings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make iron-containing products hazardous to infants and young 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
children because of their apparent attractiveness. If the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information received presents an objective basis for additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
steps that FDA could take to limit the appeal of iron-containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products to young children, FDA will consider action in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regard.

B. Forms of Iron That May Be Less Toxic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NAS has reported that, during the period from 1970 to 1987, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
food manufacturers increased their use of elemental iron (i.e., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finely divided metallic iron) by 120-fold and decreased their use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of ferrous sulfate by 30 percent (Ref. 30). The increase in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of elemental iron in conventional food may be attributed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its low cost and minimal reactivity in food. FDA is not aware of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any reports of accidental ingestions or adverse reactions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with the few commercially available iron-containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dietary supplements and drug products that incorporate elemental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iron instead of an iron salt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three basic types of elemental iron powders are marketed for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use in foods. The three types are reduced iron, electrolytic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iron, and carbonyl iron. The term ``carbonyl'' refers to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production process, not the composition of the product. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bioavailability of these various elemental iron sources is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dependent primarily on their physical characteristics, which in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
turn depend on the manufacturing method. For example, higher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relative bioavailabilities of elemental iron are obtained with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smaller particle sizes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some evidence suggests that carbonyl iron may be a useful 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substitute for the more commonly used chemical compounds of iron 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in reducing risk of accidental iron poisonings. Data from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies in animals suggest that carbonyl iron may be only 1/100th 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as toxic as ferrous sulfate in single doses, i.e., the LD
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(lethal dose for 50 percent of the test group) of ferrous sulfate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is approximately 0.30 g Fe/kg (Ref. 32) and the LD
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for carbonyl 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iron is approximately 30.0 g Fe/kg body weight (Ref. 31). Thus, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carbonyl iron, in comparison with ferrous sulfate, appears to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a much larger margin of safety between the level that would provide adequate iron nutrition and the level that
causes acute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxicity. Consequently, carbonyl iron may be inherently safer to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use. At the same time, data from human subjects indicates that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the overall bioavailability of carbonyl iron in supporting the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nutritional functions of iron is about 70 percent that of ferrous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sulfate (Ref. 31). Thus carbonyl iron is reasonably as effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in providing iron in the amounts needed to achieve the nutritive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects of iron. Its use may help to reduce the risk of iron 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
poisoning in children. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA specifically requests comments on the appropriateness of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elemental iron as a source of iron in drugs and dietary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplements, focusing on whether its use in iron-containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products would decrease the risk of pediatric poisonings while 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing desirable iron nutrition to those who need iron 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplementation. The agency is interested in receiving data on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the potential of elemental iron for acute toxicity in humans and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particularly in children. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA will carefully consider any information it receives on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this subject. If the information is persuasive in establishing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the use of elemental iron would substantially decrease the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk of pediatric poisoning while allowing for effective dietary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iron supplementation, FDA will consider exempting iron-containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products that incorporate elemental iron from any regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that result from this rulemaking.

C. Educational Efforts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Review of Consumer Education Issues in Citizen Petitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two of the three petitions submitted discussed the benefits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of educational efforts for the public and health professionals, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
focusing on the prevention of accidental pediatric iron 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
poisoning. The AAPCC petition and the NDMA petition advocated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
educational efforts and outlined specific actions as described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
herein. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The AAPCC petition. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The AAPCC petition called for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initiation of an FDA educational campaign for four different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
segments of the population. The four target segments are: (1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Parents, babysitters, daycare providers, and other consumers; (2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pediatricians; (3) obstetricians; and (4) other health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professionals such as physicians, others who can prescribe iron, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and pharmacists. The petition suggested that pediatricians 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discuss the dangers of an iron overdose with parents at the 6-month checkup, and that obstetricians inform mothers
at the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
postpartum checkup. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The NDMA petition. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the fall of 1993, NDMA in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooperation with CPSC, developed and launched a national consumer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
education campaign to be carried out in conjunction with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
voluntary labeling and packaging measures (described above in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section I.D. of this document) that were undertaken by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
members of NDMA and NNFA. The purpose of the campaign, as stated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the petition, is to inform adults about how to protect children from accidental iron poisoning. The three major
themes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the educational campaign mirror some of the messages in NDMA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and NNFA's voluntary warning statements for iron-containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products and are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Adult awareness of the dangers to children if iron is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accidentally swallowed in excess, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Reclose the child-resistant package after every use, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Keep iron-containing products out of the reach of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
children. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NDMA and CPSC began the educational campaign by distributing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
video and print news releases, radio news releases in English and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Spanish, and public service announcements emphasizing the three-pronged message. The public service announcements
are also being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sent to consumer, health, and women's magazines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Agency Response 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA agrees with the petitioners that the public needs to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
informed of the dangers of pediatric iron poisoning through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public education efforts. Such efforts can be one important 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
element in combating a cause of injury and deaths that has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected thousands of children over the last approximately 10 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years. Thus, FDA commends NDMA and CPSC for their joint efforts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in developing and distributing a national educational campaign 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
targeting accidental iron poisoning, to coincide with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
voluntary packaging and labeling measures for iron-containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products that have been undertaken by the members of NDMA and NNFA. FDA believes that the themes of this campaign are

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate and are responsive to a fundamental need that exists 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for more awareness among adults of the dangers of pediatric iron 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
poisoning and of the means to prevent these poisonings. Because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the seriousness of the problem, i.e., accidental iron 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingestion is the leading cause of poisoning deaths among 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
children, FDA intends to contribute to educating the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, FDA is developing materials for a public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information campaign that would address AAPCC's request and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complement NDMA and CPSC's educational efforts by emphasizing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same awareness and prevention elements as the NDMA/CPSC campaign, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Iron-containing products can seriously injure or even 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kill young children who accidentally swallow them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Reclose the child-resistant package completely and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
every time iron-containing products are opened. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Keep all containers of iron-containing products out of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reach of children 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all the time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA's campaign will also address steps that should be taken 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by adults if an accidental ingestion of iron occurs: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) When children accidentally ingest iron-containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products, the attending person should quickly call a poison control center and follow their instructions, or take
the child 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to an emergency room. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Although the first symptoms, vomiting and diarrhea, may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occur within 30 minutes, and these symptoms may be followed by an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appearance of recovery, the child may still be in danger. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, immediate professional consultation is critical. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDA materials will include print pieces available for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution to different audiences, such as a backgrounder, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flyer, an FDA Consumer 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
magazine article, and camera-ready 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
newspaper columns. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FDA Medical Bulletin, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
which has 1,000,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physician subscribers, is another vehicle that can be used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
publicize this message. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The diversity of the audiences to be targeted by FDA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information campaign will include the AAPCC's suggested target 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
populations. The FDA backgrounder will be a detailed handout for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health professionals and consumer organizations. The flyer will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be a short piece conveying the elements of FDA's message in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
simple and concise manner for use in the home by parents, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grandparents, and babysitters. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FDA Consumer 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
article will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reach the 23,000 subscribers to the magazine, a group that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
includes physicians and other health professionals, educators, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporters, and consumers. The camera-ready newspaper columns 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be distributed to 10,000 smaller-circulation newspapers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nationwide. In addition, FDA intends to provide information to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer newsletter editors and consumers through ``Dear Editor'' letters and ``Dear Consumer'' letters about
the efforts to prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accidental pediatric iron poisoning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Different offices in FDA, such as the Office of Public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Affairs and the Office of Consumer Affairs, and offices of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department of Health and Human Services will assist with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of these materials. FDA intends to utilize its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
staff of public affairs specialists to distribute these materials 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the widely varied constituencies with whom these specialists 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequently interact, such as other government agencies at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal, State, and local levels, advocacy organizations, trade 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associations, consumer groups, health professional organizations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and other interested groups. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Environmental Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has carefully considered the potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action will not have a significant impact on the human 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment, and that an environmental impact statement is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence supporting that finding, contained in an environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

VI. Analysis of Impacts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has examined the impacts of the proposed rule under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
96&hyph;354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximize net benefits (including potential economic, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distributive impacts; and equity). The agency believes that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule is consistent with the regulatory philosophy and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principles identified in the Executive Order. In addition, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the Executive Order and so is not subject to review under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Description of the Industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 300 iron-containing products that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be affected by these proposed actions, of which approximately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one-half contain 30 mg or more iron per dosage unit. The types 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of iron-containing products that have been associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
poisonings of young children are products offered in solid oral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dosage form as multi-vitamin/mineral supplements, products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended for use as iron supplements, and drug products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Typically, multi-vitamin/mineral supplements provide less than 30 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mg of iron per dosage unit. Iron supplements and drug products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
typically contain 30 mg or more iron per dosage unit. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed action to require warning statements would affect all iron-containing products. On the other hand, FDA
is proposing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to require unit-dose packaging for products containing 30 mg or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more iron per dosage unit. Therefore, most multi-vitamin/mineral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplements would be subject to the warning statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements but not to the packaging requirements. Most iron 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplements and iron-containing drug products would be subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both proposed requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Iron-containing products may be purchased by consumers on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their own initiative as dietary supplements, or they may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prescribed by physicians. The information available to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry suggests that the overwhelming majority of iron- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing products are currently packaged in bottles (Ref. 33). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional information suggests that iron-containing products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administered in hospitals are commonly packaged in unit-dose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
packaging (Ref. 34). Unit-dose packaging is preferred by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospitals because with this type of packaging, each dosage unit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has an identification and an expiration date, and the hospital 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can continue to use unit-dose packaged drugs rather than having 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to discard a bottle opened for a specific patient after that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
patient is discharged. Based on this information, FDA assumes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that iron-containing products dispensed in hospitals are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently packaged in unit-dose packaging. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the National Center for Health Statistics, of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the approximately 169 million persons of age 18 or older, 19.7 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent consume iron-containing products (Ref. 35). If it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumed that each individual consumes one dosage unit per day,there are approximately 12 billion dosage units of
iron- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing products consumed annually in the United States. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency does not have complete information on the number of dosage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
units of iron-containing products that contain 30 mg or more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iron. However, because only pregnant women require 30 mg/day, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA assumes that the portion of higher-dosage iron-containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products can be estimated by the number of pregnant women in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States. In 1991, the most recent year for which data are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available, there were 4.1 million live births (Ref. 36). FDA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assuming a one-to-one correspondence between the number of live 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
births and the number of pregnancies in concluding that there are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about 4.1 million pregnant women on any one day in the United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States. The number of live births may overestimate the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pregnant women because multiple births by one woman are ignored. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, the number of live births ignores pregnancies not resulting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a live birth, which may result in an underestimate of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of pregnant women. If it is assumed that the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
live births is an estimate of the number of dosage units of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products containing 30 mg or more iron, then the number of dosage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
units per year can be estimated at 4.1 million times 365 days per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year or about 1.5 billion.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

There are many possible regulatory alternatives available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that may reduce the number of cases of pediatric poisonings from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the accidental ingestion of iron-containing products. The options include packaging, warning statements, product

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reformulation, and educational efforts.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One regulatory option available to FDA is to require that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products containing iron be packaged in unit-dose containers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the CPSC regulations, most iron-containing products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently must be packaged in CRC's. Therefore, the effect of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this option would be to require child resistant unit-dose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
packaging for most of these products. FDA could require unit- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dose packaging for all products or for only higher dosage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. For comparison, FDA will consider potencies of 30 mg, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 mg, and 60 mg as the minimum potencies per dosage unit of iron 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that would trigger unit-dosage packaging.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Costs. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are four types of costs associated with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandated packaging change: Equipment, materials, transportation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and administrative costs. If this option is selected, many 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
packagers of iron-containing products will be required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchase new packaging equipment. The cost of equipment used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
packaging blisters, one common form of unit-dose packaging, is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between $50,000 and $250,000, or on average $132,500. New 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment will not be purchased for each product sold because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some manufacturers already possess unit-dose packaging equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cost of child-resistant bottles, currently the most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
common form of packaging, is approximately $7 per 1,000 dosage units. Child-resistant blisters cost approximately
$9 per 1,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dosage units, a difference of $2 per 1,000 dosage units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA does not have information to estimate additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transportation costs caused by unit-dose packaging requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and requests comments on increased transportation costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, firms are expected to incur administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs of approximately $500 per product in the first year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrative costs are the dollar value of the incremental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative effort expended in order to comply with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation. Administrative activities include, but are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited to, identifying the underlying policy of the regulation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interpreting that policy relative to the firm's products, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishing a corporate position, formulating a method for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance, and managing the compliance effort. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If FDA were to require unit-dose packaging for all iron- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing products irrespective of their potency per dosage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit, the cost of equipment would be $39 million (300 products &times; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$132,500). The annual materials cost would be $24 million ((12 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
billion dosage units/1,000) &times; $2.00), or $260 million over the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
next 20 years (discounted at 7 percent). Administrative costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be $150,000. Total costs associated with requiring unit- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dose packaging for all iron-containing products would be $299 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
million over 20 years (discounted at seven percent). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If FDA were to require unit-dose packaging for products with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30 mg iron/dosage unit or higher, the cost of equipment would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$20 million (150 products &times; $132,500). The cost of materials would be $3 million per year or $32 million over
20 years 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(discounted at 7 percent). Administrative costs would be $75,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(150 &times; $500). Total costs associated with requiring unit-dose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
packaging for products containing 30 mg or more per dosage unit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be $52 million over 20 years (discounted at 7 percent). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If FDA were to require unit-dose packaging for products with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 mg iron/dosage unit or higher, the cost of equipment would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$13 million (100 products &times; $132,500). The cost of materials 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be $2 million per year or $22 million over 20 years 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(discounted at 7 percent). Administrative costs would be $50,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(100 &times; $500). Total costs associated with requiring unit-dose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
packaging for products containing 40 mg or more iron per dosage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit would be $35 million over 20 years (discounted at 7 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If FDA were to require unit-dose packaging for products with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
60 mg iron/dosage unit or higher, the cost of equipment would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$5 million (37 products &times; $132,500). The cost of materials would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be $0.8 million per year or $8 million over 20 years (discounted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at 7 percent). Administrative costs would be $19,000 (37 &times; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$500). Total costs associated with requiring unit-dose packaging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for products containing 60 mg or more iron per dosage unit would

 Benefits.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the past 7 years, there have been at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
37 cases of pediatric fatality from the accidental ingestion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iron-containing products, or a mean of 5.3 deaths per year. Data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the potency of the product consumed is available for 25 cases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In all cases for which information is available, the product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumed contained at least 40 mg of iron. In the same 7-year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period, there were nearly 190 poisonings reported that were life 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threatening or that resulted in permanent injury, and over 2,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reported poisonings requiring some form of treatment. FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that most, if not all, such deaths and some poisonings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be prevented by requiring that higher-potency iron-containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products be packaged in unit-dose packaging. Studies indicate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the child is less likely to consume the number of dosage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
units that may be fatal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although no studies have attempted to directly estimate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value of reducing the risk of death and illness to children in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular, many studies have attempted to estimate the value of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reducing these risks to adults. Most of these estimates are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on wage differences between high and low risk jobs and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thus, are derived from the labor market decisions of middle-aged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adults. Although these estimates cluster around a fairly small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
range, $2 million to $10 million, it is not clear that these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimates are valid when applied to children. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has used estimates of the value of reducing risks to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adults to a level that would avoid one statistical fatality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between $1.5 million and $5 million in past rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proceedings, including recent food labeling regulations and a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current proposal to require domestic and foreign processors and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importers of fish and fishery products to establish Hazard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Analysis Critical Control Points (HAACP) controls to prevent the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurrence of hazards that could affect the safety of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood products (59 FR 4142, January 28, 1994). One method of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimating the value of reducing risks to children is to adjust 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the value of reducing risks to adults by accounting for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difference in the number of life-years saved. Under this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach, an often used estimate of the value of the risks to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adults to a level that would avoid one statistical fatality is $5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
million for a middle-aged adult. If this value does not vary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with life years remaining (that is, if we assume that an infant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is willing to pay the same amount to avoid risk of death as a 40-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year old would be willing to pay and assuming the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of wealth exists in both age groups), then $5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
million is a reasonable estimate. If, however, this value does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vary with life years remaining, then the corresponding value for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reducing the risks to small children would be $11 million. FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will use these figures ($5 to 11 million) to provide a range of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimates. Although FDA is using these values in this analysis, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA stresses the tentative nature of these estimates and requests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments on an appropriate method of estimating the value of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reducing risks to children. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The number of fatalities prevented by requiring unit-dose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
packaging for iron-containing products at any potency level less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 60 mg iron/dosage unit will not be significantly different. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because all fatalities for which FDA has information resulted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from ingestion of dosage units of at least 40 mg iron potency, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all three of these options (all products, 30 mg and above, and 40 mg and above) would result in benefits of reducing an
average of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5.3 deaths per year, valued at between $280 million and $618 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
million over 20 years (discounted at 7 percent). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If, however, FDA were to select the option of requiring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit-dose packaging for all iron-containing products of potencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 60 mg iron per dosage unit and above, an average of 5 deaths 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be prevented per year leading to total discounted benefits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of preventing fatalities over 20 years of between $265 million 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and $583 million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requiring unit-dosage packaging for iron-containing products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will also reduce the number of nonfatal cases of pediatric iron 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
poisoning. FDA has obtained from CPSC case reports for 78 iron 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingestions necessitating emergency room treatment reported over 7 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years, or an average of 11 illnesses per year. The potency of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the product consumed was reported for 12 cases. In five of those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cases, the potency reported was under 30 mg iron/dosage unit. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seven cases, the potency reported was over 60 mg iron/dosage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit. AAPCC data shows that from 1986 through 1992 there were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nearly 190 reported poisonings that were life threatening or that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resulted in permanent injury, and over 2,000 reported poisonings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requiring some form of treatment as a result of accidental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingestion of adult and pediatric iron-containing products, or an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average of 286 per year. FDA is unable to predict the percentage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of these nonfatal poisonings which would be prevented by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substituting unit-dose packaging for bottles. It is possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that not all nonfatal poisonings will be prevented because a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
child can still gain access to the product. However, he or she 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will gain access to fewer dosage units than if the product is in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a bottle. FDA requests comments on this issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Using a methodology developed previously for FDA to value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
morbidity risks, FDA is able to estimate the value of reduced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk of nonfatal poisoning. By comparing similar symptoms and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
medical interventions, the agency has derived an estimate of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value of preventing a nonfatal pediatric iron poisoning of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$20,000 per case. (Ref. 37) As stated previously, 7 out of 12 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cases of nonfatal poisonings were a result of ingestion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products of potencies over 60 mg iron per dosage unit. If this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proportion can be extrapolated to the remaining cases for which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information is unknown, and if unit-dose packaging will prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all nonfatal cases (at least 2,000 cases in 7 years), then 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requiring unit-dose packaging for products of 60 mg or more iron 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per dosage unit will add approximately $35 million to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefits over the next 20 years (discounted at seven percent). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because no nonfatal cases for which information is known were a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result of ingesting products with potencies between 30 mg and 60 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mg iron per dosage unit, the options of requiring unit-dose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
packaging for products with potencies of 40 mg and 30 mg iron per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dosage unit will not add more to the benefits than the previous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
option. Still assuming that all nonfatal cases can be prevented 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by unit-dose packaging, requiring packaging changes for all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products would result in reduced morbidity valued at $61 million 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over the next 20 years.

The total value of the benefits of unit-dose packaging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
options is the sum of the value of reducing both mortality and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
morbidity risks. The selected option, requiring unit-dose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
packaging for all products containing 30 mg or more iron per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dosage unit, would result in benefits of reducing mortality risks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of between $280 million and $618 million and reduced morbidity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
valued at $61 million. Therefore, total discounted benefits of

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Every petition submitted to FDA requested that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the agency require that iron-containing product labels contain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warning statements about the potentially fatal effects of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pediatric poisonings from accidental ingestion of iron-containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. The cost associated with warning statements are the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost of redesigning the label, disposing of old labels, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative costs. In January, 1994, FDA published final rules regarding nutrition labeling of dietary supplements
in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(NLEA) and the Dietary Supplement Act of 1992. In its analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of those rules (59 FR 352), FDA determined that the incremental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost of label changes for dietary supplement manufacturers is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately $1,500 per label. FDA is proposing that the label 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warning statement be printed directly on the immediate container 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the product, i.e., the container that holds the tablet or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capsule, and on the principal display panel of the retail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
package, if such package is not the immediate container. If a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product is sold in unit-dose packaging, the product would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to bear the warning directly on each unit-dose package 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or on a strip of unit-dose packages in such a way that separating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the unit-dose packages would not destroy the warning labeling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers of all 300 iron-containing products will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to change their labels on both the product container and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the retail package to incorporate warning statements. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because manufacturers of iron-containing products with 30 mg or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more per dosage unit will also be required to change their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
packaging, they will not incur any incremental cost in adding a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warning statement to the product container. Therefore, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labeling costs will be incurred by all 300 products for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retail package and for 150 products for the product container.

An additional cost of this regulation may be an increase in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iron deficiency anemia if susceptible adults react 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inappropriately to a warning label targeted for children. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to NHANES II, approximately 7.2 percent of females age 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15 to 19 and 6.3 percent of females age 20 to 44 are iron-deficient but less than one-fourth of these women had anemia

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with the deficiency. In addition, males had a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevalence of less than 1 percent. FDA requests comments on this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 b. Benefits. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Warning statements will only prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pediatric iron poisonings to the extent that they lead to changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the behavior of the adult controlling the use of the product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(presumably the parent). Whether the warning messages prescribed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in this proposed rule will cause a change in behavior will depend 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on a number of factors, including the degree to which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement is noticed, read, and understood. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 There is some evidence that warning statements can change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
behavior. For example, research indicates that rate of increase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of sales of diet soft drinks declined after saccharin warnings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were put on the labels of these products (Ref. 38). FDA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unable to predict exactly how many cases of pediatric iron 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
poisoning will be prevented as a result of warning statements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To the extent that warning statements will cause adults to take 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proper care in handling iron-containing products, and to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extent that such care is not taken in the absence of warning statements, some cases of pediatric iron poisoning will
be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 If the agency requires unit-dose packaging, and this measure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is 100 percent effective in preventing both fatal and nonfatal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cases, then there are no benefits from warning labels on these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. However, for those products still packaged in bottles, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warning labels may have an impact. If each nonfatal case of iron 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
poisoning is valued at $20,000 and the one-time cost of warning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statements is $675,000, then benefits of requiring warning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statements will exceed costs if warning statements prevent at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least three nonfatal cases every year for the next 20 years 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(discounted at 7 percent). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Product Reformulation_Appearance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two petitions recommended product reformulation as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preventive measure. The petitions suggested that some adult 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formulations of iron-containing products look and taste like 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
candy and thus are more appealing to children. The petitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated that if the product were less appealing to children, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incidence of accidental ingestion would be reduced. The petition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from NDMA urged FDA to reject reformulation for several reasons, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including a lack of knowledge about what a pill looks like to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
very young child, and about why the child is motivated to consume 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the product. The agency does not have information to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either the costs or the benefits of reformulating the appearance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of iron-containing products. Because reformulation costs are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
highly dependent on the individual decisions of firms, they are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
very difficult to estimate. Also, because there are currently no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
objective measures of the candy-like appearance of iron-containing products, the benefits are also difficult to

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

4. Product Reformulation_Taste

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another possibility is to add a bitter substance to products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing iron which would discourage multiple ingestions. Such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substances have been used in the past on products which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discourage thumbsucking and nailbiting. It is highly likely that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such a substance will not add significantly to the cost of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
producing iron-containing products. FDA requests information on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a policy option that would require altering the taste of iron-containing products. Such information would include
the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential substances that would make the pills bitter and data on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their safety and whether this approach would be effective in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preventing acute overdose of iron-containing products by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
children. FDA notes, however, that such an option may have the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unintended side effect of causing persons who need iron 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplementation to avoid the product. FDA requests information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on both the costs and benefits of this option.

5. Forms of Iron that May be Less Toxic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As previously discussed in this document, some evidence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggests that carbonyl iron, an elemental iron powder, seems to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be effective in the prevention or treatment of iron deficiency, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and that it might be significantly less toxic than other forms of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iron commonly used in iron-containing products. The agency requested data on the acute toxicity in humans, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particularly in children, of elemental iron. FDA stated that, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if information is received that is persuasive that the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elemental iron will substantially decrease the risk of pediatric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
poisoning while allowing for effective dietary iron 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplementation, it will consider exempting iron-containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products that incorporate reduced iron from any regulations that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result from this rulemaking. FDA does not have any information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding the availability of such forms of iron for use in iron-containing products. Nor does FDA possess any information
that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would allow it to determine how many products would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reformulated with less toxic forms of iron in order to take 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advantage of such an exemption. FDA requests comment on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic impact of exempting products containing less toxic forms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of iron.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two of the three petitions that FDA received advocated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
educational efforts for the public and health professionals. FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agrees that the public needs to be informed of the dangers of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pediatric iron poisoning. The fact that in 7 years over 2,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
poisonings have occurred that have required some kind of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment indicates that the public is not aware of the potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for serious harm or death in young children from accidental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingestion of iron-containing products. FDA is developing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials for a public information campaign utilizing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
channels available to the agency.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

The agency is proposing to make any final rule that may issue based upon this proposal become effective 180 days after
its publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. FDA is requesting comments on this effective date. In general, costs of compliance for labeling and other requirements
are less if longer compliance periods are provided because firms can incorporate mandatory changes to product, labeling,
and packaging with regularly scheduled changes. FDA requests information on the ability of manufacturers of products
that contain 30 mg or more iron per dosage unit to convert their packaging within the suggested compliance period.

The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires analyzing options for regulatory relief for small businesses when possible.
FDA is not aware that any small businesses will be affected by this proposed rule. Therefore, FDA tentatively concludes
that this proposed rule will not result in a significant burden on small businesses. FDA requests comments on any potential
adverse effect on small businesses.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has examined the impact of the proposed rule in accordance with Executive Order 12866 and has determined that it
is not an economically significant rule. The rule will result in total costs of approximately $53 million and discounted
benefits of between $315 million and $653 million over the next 20 years (discounted at 7 percent). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has also examined the impact of this proposed rule on small businesses in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility
Act. FDA is unaware of any iron-containing products manufactured by small businesses. Therefore, FDA has determined
that this rule will not result in a significant burden on small businesses.

if the dietary supplements are offered in solid oral dosage form (e.g., tablets or capsules) and contain 30 milligrams
or more of iron per dosage unit, when such supplements are packaged in unit-dose packaging. ``Unit-dose packaging''
means a method of packaging a product into a nonreusable container designed to hold a single dosage unit intended for
administration directly from that container, irrespective of whether the recommended dose is one or more than one
of these units. The term ``dosage unit'' means the individual physical unit of the product, e.g., tablets or capsules.
