SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On September 8, 1993, the Department of Energy published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (58 FR 47326) regarding
energy conservation standards for three types of consumer products. In that Advance Notice, the Department stated
that it intended to consider more explicitly environmental and energy security externalities associated with alternative
energy efficiency standards. Specifically, the Department expressed the intention to monetize the values of any
externalized benefits (or costs) if a sound analytic basis could be found. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this notice is to solicit public comments on whether and how the Department should evaluate and consider
environmental and energy security externalities that may be associated with alternative, candidate energy efficiency
standards. It has three specific aims: First, it requests focused public input on specific questions related to the
development and use of environmental and energy security externality values. Second, it outlines the Department's
preliminary thinking in several of these issue areas in order to provide stakeholders with maximum available information.
Finally, it solicits public identification of other issues relevant to the application of externality values in
the context of appliance standards, so that these may be considered in appliance standards rulemakings.

 created the Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products other than Automobiles (Program). The consumer products
subject to the Program (often referred to hereafter as ``covered products'') are: Refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers,
and freezers; dishwashers; clothes washers; clothes dryers; water heaters; central air conditioners and central
air-conditioning heat pumps; furnaces; direct heating equipment; television sets; kitchen ranges and ovens; room
air conditioners; fluorescent lamp ballasts; and pool heaters; as well as any other consumer products classified
by the Secretary of Energy (Secretary) (section 322). To date, the Secretary has not so classified any additional
products.

Part B of Title III of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended by the National Energy Conservation Policy
Act, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act, and the National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendments
of 1988, is referred to in this Supplemental Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking as the ``Act.'' Part B of Title III
is codified at 42 U.S.C. 6291 et seq. Part B of Title III of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended by the National
Energy Conservation Policy Act only, is referred to as the National Energy Conservation Policy Act.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Act, the Program consists essentially of three parts: testing, labeling, and mandatory energy conservation
standards. DOE, in consultation with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, is required to amend or
establish new test procedures as appropriate for each of the covered products (section 323). The purpose of the test
procedures is to provide for test results that reflect the energy efficiency, energy use, or estimated annual operating
costs of each of the covered products (section 323(b)(3)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal Trade Commission is required by the Act to prescribe rules governing the labeling of covered products
for which test procedures have been prescribed by DOE (section 324(a)). These rules require that each particular
model of a covered product bear a label that indicates its annual operating cost and the range of estimated annual operating
costs for other models of that product class (section 324(c)(1)). At the present time, there are Federal Trade Commission
rules requiring labels for the following products: room air conditioners, furnaces, clothes washers, dishwashers,
water heaters, freezers, refrigerators and refrigerator-freezers, central air conditioners and central air-conditioning
heat pumps, and fluorescent lamp ballasts. 44 FR 66475, November 19, 1979; 52 FR 46888, December 10, 1987; and 54 FR
28031, July 5, 1989.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For each of 12 of the covered products, the Act prescribes an initial Federal energy conservation standard (section
325(b)-(h)). The Act establishes effective dates for the standards in 1988, 1990, 1992 or 1993, depending on the product,
and specifies that the standards are to be reviewed by DOE within three to ten years, also depending on the product (Ibid.).
After the specified three- to ten-year period, DOE may promulgate new standards for each product; however, the Secretary
may not prescribe any amended standard that increases the maximum allowable energy use or decreases the minimum required
energy efficiency of a covered product (section 325(l)(1)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to television sets, the Act allows DOE to prescribe an applicable standard. (section 325(i)(3)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three products (central air conditioners and central air-conditioning heat pumps; furnaces; and refrigerators,
refrigerator-freezers and freezers) are the subject of this rulemaking proceeding. For central air conditioners
and central air-conditioning heat pumps, the Act directs DOE to review each legislated standard for possible amendment
and to issue final rules as follows: for the seasonal energy efficiency ratio, no later than January 1, 1994, for units
manufactured after January 1, 1999; and for the heating seasonal performance factor, no later than January 1, 1994,
for units manufactured after January 1, 2002. For furnaces, the Act directs DOE to review the previously established
standard for small gas furnaces (54 FR 47916, November 17, 1989), the pending standard for mobile home furnaces, and
the legislated standards for all other covered furnaces for possible amendment and to issue final rules no later than
January 1, 1994, for units manufactured after January 1, 2002. For refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and freezers,
the Act directs DOE to review the previous final rule, published November 17, 1989, for possible amendment and to issue
final rules no later than November 17, 1994, for units manufactured after January 1, 1998.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any new or amended standard is required to be designed so as to achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency
that is technologically feasible and economically justified (section 325(l)(2)(A)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 325(l)(2)(B)(i) provides that before DOE determines whether an energy conservation standard is economically
justified, it must first solicit comments on the proposed standard. After reviewing comments on the proposal, DOE
must then determine that the benefits of the standard exceed its burdens based, to the greatest extent practicable,
on a weighing of the following seven factors:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The economic impact of the standard on the manufacturers and on the consumers of the products subject to such standard;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The savings in operating costs throughout the estimated average life of the covered product in the type (or class)
compared to any increase in the price, initial charges, or maintenance expenses for the covered products that are
likely to result directly from the imposition of the standard;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The total projected amount of energy savings likely to result directly from the imposition of the standard;

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) Any lessening of the utility or the performance of the covered products likely to result from the imposition of
the standard;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The impact of any lessening of competition, as determined in writing by the Attorney General, that is likely to
result from the imposition of the standard;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The need for national energy conservation; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Other factors the Secretary considers relevant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 327 of the Act addresses the effect of Federal rules concerning testing, labeling, and standards on State
laws or regulations concerning such matters. Generally, all such State laws or regulations are superseded by the
Act (section 327(a)&hyph;(c)). Exceptions to this general rule include the following: (1) State standards prescribed
or enacted before January 8, 1987, and applicable to appliances produced before January 3, 1988, may remain in effect
until the applicable energy conservation standard begins (section 327(b)(1)); (2) State procurement standards
which are more stringent than the applicable Federal standard (section 327(b)(2) and (e)) and certain building code
requirements for new construction, if certain criteria are met, are exempt from Federal preemption (sections 327(b)(3)
and (f)(1)&hyph;f(4)); (3) State regulations banning constant burning pilot lights in pool heaters; and (4) State
standards for television sets effective on or after January 1, 1992, may remain in effect in the absence of a Federal
standard for such products (sections 327(b)(6) and (c)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act directs DOE to publish an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in advance of DOE consideration of prescribing
a new or amended standard.

In the Advance Notice to which this is a supplement, the Department indicated its intention more explicitly to consider
environmental and energy security externalities associated with alternative energy efficiency standards. The
Department also noted that it would attempt to establish monetary values for externalities if a sound analytical
basis could be found for doing so.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 If the Department finds that a sound analytical basis exists, externalities may be incorporated in its analysis of
the net national benefits of alternative levels for the appliance efficiency standards covered by this rulemaking.

Externalities arise when the production or consumption of goods and services imposes costs or confers benefits on
members of society external to the transaction that are not reflected in market prices. Environmental externalities
reflect the net national reductions in the adverse health effects or other damages associated with a reduction in
emissions of pollutants due to reductions in energy use as appliance efficiency is increased. Energy security externalities
reflect the net national reductions in energy security vulnerability associated with reduced reliance on external
energy sources.

&bull;The Sierra Club stated that the difference between ``Consumer Analysis'' and ``Life Cycle Cost Analysis''
is difficult to ascertain. They urged DOE to evaluate, as part of the Consumer Analysis: (a) Environmental external
costs; and (b) national security and balance of payments costs of increased/decreased oil consumption. (Sierra
Club, No. 43 at 2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Ohio Office of the Consumers Council (OOCC) said that the consumer and utility analyses should include
monetization of externalities (environmental and security). Environmental externalities include sulfur oxides,
carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate, and other air, water, and land use impacts of energy
production and use. Such considerations should be consistent with current trends in state utility regulations.
(OOCC, No. 60 at 2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recognizing that the specification of monetary values for such environmental and energy security externalities
is a complex analytical effort, the Department is now supplementing its original Advance Notice for the three-product
rulemaking. This supplement provides an indication of the Department's intent in this area, identifies a range of
specific issues for public comment, and solicits identification of additional relevant issues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated in the 1993 Advance Notice, the Department will attempt to develop analytically sound estimates of the
values of energy and environmental externalities. Provided that such values can be calculated, the Department intends
to use them in the analyses supporting the proposed and final rules establishing the standards for the products covered
by this notice. Estimates of such externalities would be considered in conjunction with the estimates of the total
net national benefits (or costs) of the standard, rather than in the analysis of consumer life-cycle costs. The life-cycle
cost analysis is intended to estimate the actual cost impacts on consumers. So long as externalities are not internalized,
individual consumers would not incur these benefits (or costs) directly.

The Department believes that the relationship between price and marginal cost, including the marginal cost of emission
controls, bears significantly on the size of the incremental adjustments to be made in the analysis in order to incorporate
environmental and energy security externalities into the assessment of net national benefits. The Department will
consider this relationship in determining the monetary values (if any) that should be placed on the external or marginal
environmental and energy benefits likely to result from appliance efficiency standards. The consideration of marginal
costs in this context also raises the question of whether the Department should use marginal electricity prices,
rather than estimates of average retail prices, for the calculation of net national benefits. The Department invites
comments on these issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. The potential impact of externalities on the determination of appliance efficiency standard levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, the net national benefits estimated by the Department to result from appliance efficiency standards
have, in the past, excluded environmental and energy security externalities. The Department recognizes that the
approach taken for including these benefits in economic analyses of alternative appliance standards may vary, depending
on issues and variables that are specific to each standard under consideration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any estimates of environmental externalities would reflect ranges of uncertainties and be considered with other
national benefits associated with appliance efficiency standards. The consideration of externality values may
or may not influence the appliance efficiency standards selected for one or more appliances, depending on the quantitative
externality estimates and their relationship to the costs of higher efficiency and other elements of the analysis.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. The structure of the Department's analysis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department intends to adopt a consistent approach in the treatment of externalities and the development of externality
values throughout these rulemakings. Therefore, this analysis starts with consideration of crosscutting issues
that are likely to bear on all standards and all types of externalities. This analysis of crosscutting questions provides
a framework for an analysis specific to each type of externality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following discussion is framed around a series of focused issues for public comment. For convenience, the main
issues addressed are numbered consecutively throughout the entire notice. The numbered set provides a convenient
summary of the Department's current view regarding the issues that bear on the development and use of externality
values in the appliance standards analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issues related to toxins, solid waste, and discharges affecting waste quality are not discussed in detail in this
notice. However, the Department invites comment on the potential importance of these emissions pathways to the determination
of externality values. Comments that are structured so as to address the same generic and externality-specific issues
raised in this notice, while also identifying other issues unique to particular pollutants or media, would be particularly
helpful. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, it is worth emphasizing that the Department's current positions on many issues outlined below is not yet
firm. Responses to issues in this supplemental Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking could substantially alter
the Department's approach as the rulemaking progresses. Parties are also encouraged to raise, and comment on, additional
issues related to evaluating externalities and the use of such estimates in determining appliance standard levels.

Issue I: The relationship between existing environmental regulations or the use of externality values in the resource
planning process and the use of externality values in setting appliance standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on its current information, the Department does not believe that existing programs of environmental regulation
or existing uses of externality adders in the resource planning process preclude the use of externality values in
analyses considered in setting appliance standards.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The relationship between externality adders and environmental regulation has been extensively studied. One key
finding is that proper use of externality adders does not turn on whether there is ``overcontrol'' or ``undercontrol''
in existing environmental regulation. Rather, taking the environmental control regime as given, the use of externality
adders can improve net national welfare by moving ``private'' decisionmaking within the existing regulatory regime
closer to ``social'' decisionmaking. For example, even if there is ``overcontrol'', it is still desirable that the
external impacts of differences in residual damage resulting from differing emissions levels associated with alternative
energy supply and end-use efficiency options be reflected in private decision-making. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on its current understanding, the Department also believes that existing uses of externality values in the
resource planning process do not present a barrier to the use of externality values in setting appliance standards.
The former are largely focused on bringing social costing considerations into capacity planning decisions, while
the latter is focused on reducing marginal electricity demand. The Department also notes that the use of externality
values in the capacity planning process is far from universal. According to a recent report of the Consumer Energy
Council of America Research Foundation (July 1993) only seven States and the Bonneville Power Administration use
quantitative externality values. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issue 2: The impact if any, of existing environmental regulations on the determination of externality values for
use in the appliance standards analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on its current understanding, the Department believes that the emission-reducing effects of existing programs
will affect externality values in two distinct ways. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, the form of current environmental regulations can influence the net emissions impact of changes in energy
use associated with alternative appliance standards. This net emissions impact reflects both the direct impact
of changes in energy use_emissions associated with changes in primary energy either directly or to generate additional
electricity_and indirect impacts that may arise due to emission caps, offset requirements, non-attainment rules,
or other features of existing regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, if regulation takes a form that fully ``internalizes'' environmental externalities on all of the relevant
margins, including, in the case of electricity, not only utility decisions related to capacity, but those related
to dispatch and additions to capacity, as well as consumer demand decisions, the role for a supplemental externality
value is difficult to identify. An emission tax equal to marginal damage that was reflected in the market price is one
example of a policy instrument (albeit not one in widespread use) that would align private and social decision-making
on all three margins.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, current regulatory programs, whatever their form, have a significant influence on ambient concentrations
of pollutants. In general, the marginal damage associated with changes in net emissions due to alternative appliance
standards is sensitive to base level of pollutant loading. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department notes that existing programs, notably implementation of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, could
result in significant changes in emissions loadings, and therefore change marginal damages, before the standards
promulgated pursuant to this rulemaking take effect. Economic growth over time would, in itself, tend to have the
opposite effect. The Department is currently considering how best to assess the marginal damages that should be associated
with any variation in emissions due to alternative appliance standards under these changing circumstances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issue 3: The geographic scope of environmental externalities that will be considered within the analysis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environmental externalities associated with energy-related emissions arise on all geographic scales. For example,
attainment of ambient air quality standards for criteria pollutants is assessed at the level of an air quality control
region, generally a county or regional metropolitan area airshed. Concentrations of the criteria pollutants Nitrous
Oxide (NO

 emissions from the utility sector are important precursors, is a pollution issue in which regional transport plays
a major role. In some parts of the country, the same is also true for smog.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some issues involving energy-related emissions can even transcend national boundaries. Increasing attention
has turned to the possibility of climate change due to increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions. Carbon dioxide, primarily from the combustion of fossil fuels, is the single most important greenhouse
gas. Because atmospheric concentrations are driven by global emissions trends, concern with greenhouse gas emissions
is truly global in nature.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that emissions impacts on all geographic scales are relevant to the development of externality
values for use in the context of this rulemaking. However, because appliance efficiency standards are implemented
at the national level, environmental externalities should be evaluated from a net national perspective. Thus, for
example, based on our current understanding, if variation in a standard increases environmental damage in some areas
while reducing it in others, only the change in net damage to the nation would be relevant to the comparison of alternative
standards.

b. The Role of Damage-based and Cost-based Measures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Issue 4: The role of damage-based and cost-based measures in the development of externality values.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that both types of measures may play a role in estimating the net national benefits of selecting
alternative energy efficiency standards. The Department does not view itself as facing a choice between damage-based
and cost-based measures; rather, different measures are applicable in different cases. Three different cases are
described below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regardless of which case applies, in all cases the Department's aim is to use economic analyses to quantify the change
in net national benefits attributable to different appliance efficiency standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Case 1: Changes in the efficiency standard selected will change national emission levels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this case, selecting a more energy-efficient standard will reduce emissions into the environment. The Department
believes that damage-based measures are the preferred means of valuing the external effects of these reductions.
Damaged-based estimates are a direct measure of the external effect of variations in emissions levels. Reductions
in damage due to reduced emissions could encompass reduced human morbidity or illness, reduced property damage,
and/or improved environmental resources.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department recognizes that, for many pollutants, the literature on the damages caused by additional emissions
is not well developed. When information on damages is lacking, the Department may consider the use of information
related to the costs of emissions reduction in its effort to values externalities. The rationale for this approach
is that control costs convey information about social willingness-to-pay for emissions reduction. If legislative
and regulatory actions to limit emissions were economically rational (i.e., control measures were adopted in strictly
increasing order of marginal cost, stopping at the point where marginal control cost and marginal benefits were equated),
marginal control costs would provide an indirect measure of marginal damages. It is generally recognized, however,
that actual regulatory practice often diverges significantly from these conditions. Therefore, the Department
proposes to consider the use of control cost information to estimate externality values in situations where changes
in efficiency standards affect emission levels only in those cases where direct damage information is unavailable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Case 2: The pollutant is subject to a binding emissions cap and changes in the efficiency standard selected will not
change national emission levels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With a binding, national emissions cap in place, the aggregate level of emissions will not be affected by the appliance
efficiency standard selected. Because of the cap, there is no net change in emissions and, therefore, there are usually
no environmental externalities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although in the case of an emissions cap there is usually no net environmental change on a national level, and therefore
no external environmental effect, the level of appliance efficiency standard selected may affect the net national
cost of meeting the emissions cap. For example, such a situation could arise from the need to meet progress requirements
under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. In such a case, adoption of a less stringent efficiency standard could trigger
adjustments in the State Implementation Plan to impose additional controls on other sources to compensate for higher
emissions from electricity generation or fuel combustion. If a more stringent appliance standard were adopted,
States might avoid the imposition of additional controls on other parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department seeks comments on whether and how the net change in environmental control costs attributable to variation
across alternative appliance standards should be included as an external effect. In this regard, DOE notes that the
effect on control costs of lower energy demand resulting from a more stringent appliance standard will vary according
to the structure of pre-existing regulatory programs. In the case of sulfur dioxide, for example, control obligations
of each emission source will remain fixed, but total compliance costs will fall. In the case of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and of VOCs, however, lower energy demand could reduce the extent to which State Implementation Plans must ratchet
down control requirements or expand the set of sources subject to emissions controls. The Department solicits comment
as to whether it is appropriate to differentiate these two situations, and how to calculate appropriate values of
net external cost savings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is worth noting that a binding national emissions cap may become non-binding over time, for example, through technology
improvements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Case 3: The pollutant is subject to regional emission caps and changes in the efficiency standard selected will change
emission levels in some areas of the country, but not others.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For situations that fall into this category, DOE would propose to use a combination of the previous two cases for computing
external effects. Comments on how to combine these two approaches would be particularly helpful.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issue 5: The use of cost information to provide a basis for determining society's willingness-to-pay for emissions
reduction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, the preferred method for computing damages from a change in emissions is to rely on direct information
from damage-based studies. When damage-based studies are not available, however, the Department will consider
using control cost information to develop indirect estimates of externality values. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department notes that existing environmental programs may embody an extremely wide range of marginal costs for
emission reductions for the same pollutant. Costs within existing programs may vary by an order of magnitude or more
across regions, and even across sources in a given region. For example, some areas have failed to implement advanced
inspection and maintenance programs costing $100 per ton, while choosing to implement other standards to reduce
the same pollutants costing $3,000 to $10,000 per ton. One issue is whether the cost of the most expensive option adopted,
the least expensive option rejected, or some other value between the two should be considered as most representative
of revealed societal willingness-to-pay for an emissions reduction.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Externality values used in state resource planning processes may provide another expression of revealed willingness-to-pay
for emissions reductions. The Department recognizes that the values used in resource planning processes are not
actually ``paid'' by either consumers or utilities. However, the use of these values appears to be directly analogous
to that contemplated by the Department in the setting of appliance standards. As noted above, only seven states applied
monetary externality values as of July 1993. Other jurisdictions applied qualitative externality values or no such
values at all. If externality values used by state regulators were to be considered as an expression of willingness-to-pay,
the Department would need to develop a national average measure that fairly characterizes a widely disparate set
of policies across the fifty states. The Department now believes that any such average should reflect differences
in the size of residential electricity markets across states. We solicit comment and suggestions regarding how averaging
across different policy types could be implemented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another issue related to the possible use of externality values from the resource planning process is that some states
have applied them in a manner that allows for the application of offsets for some or all pollutants. With offsets, sources
can reduce the quantity of emissions to which externality values are applied by securing cost-effective emissions
reductions (or emissions sequestration), often at a cost that is far below the official externality value. In such
cases, the product of actual emissions and the official externality value would significantly overstate the ``effective''
externality adjustment actually used in the planning process. The Department is considering how, if at all, offset
policies in the application of ``official'' externality values in the resource planning process bear on the relevance
of these values to the setting of appliance standards, where offset opportunities would not be available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issue 6: The role of damage assessments implicit in official decisions, such as the setting of ambient air quality
standards on damage estimates used in the appliance standards analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department notes that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other Federal agencies have the statutory
responsibility to establish standards that reflect their assessment of damages from environmental externalities.
For example, EPA is required to set primary ambient air quality standards at levels that protect the public health,
including the health of sensitive populations, with an adequate margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the one hand, the Department could rely on existing standards in determining that emissions that do not contribute
to a standards violation do not impact human health in any way. Such reliance would not, of course, preclude the finding
of other types of environmental externalities, such as ecosystem or crop damages, for emissions that do not contribute
to standards violations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternatively, the Department, recognizing that appliance standards promulgated today will have their primary
effect five to ten years into the future, and that processes for setting environmental standards often engender significant
lags, might wish to consider studies pointing to adverse health effects at concentrations below currently applicable
standards in assessing health damages. How the Department could decide which evidence is credible and relevant without
duplicating the review process for setting environmental standards, which is clearly infeasible in terms of resource
requirements, is an open issue.

C. Utility Pricing and Incremental Externality Values 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Issue 7: The impact of the utility sector pricing practices on the use of externality adders in the appliance standards
analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State utility regulatory commissions, motivated by the historical natural monopoly features of electric and natural
gas production, transportation, and distribution systems (although production systems are now increasingly seen
as allowing for competition), generally set regulated prices for electricity based on embedded rather than marginal
cost. Based on its present understanding, the Department believes that the relationship between price and marginal
cost can have a major bearing on the application of externality values in setting appliance standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some background is helpful. In the absence of externalities, the theoretical economic conditions for social welfare
maximization are met when price equals marginal cost (a pricing condition enforced by competition in perfectly competitive
industries) and each consumer sets demand to equate this marginal cost with his/her own marginal private benefit
(or marginal utility). With externalities, this private market solution diverges from the necessary conditions
for a social optimum because external costs imposed on others are not reflected in decision-making. An appropriate
externality tax or adder can move private decision-making towards the social optimum. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Within this context, consideration of the effects of a gap between price and marginal cost on the size of incremental
externality values is straightforward. Suppose, for example, that the price charged to end-users exceeds the marginal
private cost of producing and delivering electricity (or natural gas) to them. Then, in terms of private decision-making,
the positive gap by which price exceeds marginal cost would have the same effect as a tax in reducing electricity consumption
(and, implicitly, the emissions and the environmental externalities associated with production to meet incremental
demand).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because a positive difference between price and marginal cost functions as if it were a tax, it bears significantly
on the size of the additional externality adder the Department could justifiably employ when calculating the net
national benefit of alternative standards. For example, if the price of a marginal kilowatt were to exceed its marginal
cost by an amount equal to the value of the marginal externality damage, the pricing distortion in utility markets
and the externality would together create a situation where utility-customer decision-making would satisfy the
marginal conditions for social optimality without any further adjustments. An additional externality adder in
this situation would move away from the alignment of the private and social decision-making problems that motivates
concern with externalities in the first place. Based on this reasoning, DOE believes that application of an additional
externality adder in any situation where the price of a marginal kilowatt exceeds marginal cost by more than the value
of the marginal externality damage would be inconsistent with the objective of maximizing net national benefits.
In fact, for this latter case, one can envision arguments in favor of applying ``subtractors'' to utility rates used
in a calculation of net national benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department recognizes that real-world utility pricing systems are quite complex. Many systems employ a fixed
connection or service charge, together with prices to meet incremental demand that may vary with the class of service,
time of day, or level of demand within a billing period. The analysis that supports the appliance standards rulemakings
does not reflect this complexity. Rather, a national average is used to represent current and forecasted consumer
prices. Based on its present information, the Department believes that the difference between this ``analysis price''
and marginal cost, rather than the difference between some true marginal price and marginal cost, is relevant to establishing
the gap between price and cost that bears on the incorporation of incremental externality values in the Department's
analysis. The Department seeks comment on alternatives to national averages that would better reflect local and
regional differences in consumer prices, as well as the other sources of price variation mentioned above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, in some circumstances, the price facing end-users may be less than marginal cost. The same principles would
apply. Even ignoring externalities, prices below marginal cost encourage demand whose value to users is less than
the cost of production to meet it. To correct this situation and at the same time reflect externalities that may also
be present, it would be necessary to apply adders larger than the marginal damage from emissions associated with increased
energy demand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the above, the relationship between price and marginal cost is clearly central to the determination of externality
values for use in setting appliance standards.

First, the Department recognizes that the price/marginal cost relationship can vary significantly across utilities.
Given the national applicability of appliance standards, we will seek to estimate a price/marginal cost relationship
that characterizes national average conditions. The rationale here is identical to that for focusing on national
average emission impacts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the relationship between price and marginal cost may vary across appliances because of the differences in
load shapes. For example, refrigerators that run continuously might be considered as contributing to ``base load'',
while air conditioners, which are used most intensively on hot afternoons, contribute primarily to ``peak load.''
The Department solicits comment on the need to develop information on the relationship between price and marginal
cost, relevant to each individual appliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, there are several different marginal cost concepts. Short run marginal cost may, in systems with excess
capacity, include only fuel and incremental fuel and operation and maintenance costs. A long-run marginal cost concept
would also include the capital costs of generating facilities. To the extent that transmission and distribution
infrastructure costs also vary with marginal demand, these too can be included in marginal cost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has not yet developed quantitative estimates of the relationship between price and marginal cost,
or determined which marginal cost concept is relevant to the question of externality adders. Evidence that would
be relevant to such a quantification includes: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The gap between prices to industrial and residential consumers. Assuming that PUC's do not permit sales to industrial
users at prices below marginal cost (to do so would force residential and commercial customers to pick up 100 percent
of system fixed costs plus a portion of variable costs incurred for utility customers), the price of power to industrial
customers with an adjustment for any difference in marginal transmission and distribution costs between the residential
and industrial classes, could be taken as an upper bound on marginal supply costs to residential customers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported national average electricity rates in 1992 for residential
and industrial consumers of $0.082 per kilowatt hour (kWh) and $0.048 per kilowatt hour (kWh), respectively. For
natural gas, EIA reports average rates in 1992 of $5.87 per thousand cubic feet and $2.82 per thousand cubic feet for
residential and industrial consumers, respectively.

(2) The capital and operating cost of incremental capacity. If meeting marginal demand requires new capacity, the
relevant marginal cost should include capacity cost. Current estimates of fully-loaded marginal costs for natural
gas combined cycle plants or pulverized coal plants are $0.035/kwh to $0.045/kwh. Again, marginal transmission
and distribution costs, if any, would also need to be considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The marginal cost of dispatching the least efficient capacity in systems with excess capacity. One insight into
these costs can be gained by examining the operation and maintenance costs, on a per kilowatt basis, of combustion
turbines used for peaking purposes on some systems. Another perspective may be provided by the cost per kilowatt hour
of peak-shaving, demand-side management programs approved by various public utility regulatory commissions.
Public comments providing information related to these measurement approaches and their qualification would be
especially helpful. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department solicits comment on the relevance of the categories of evidence cited above, as well as other types
of evidence, in establishing a reasoned estimate of the relationship between price and marginal cost.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this section, the Department builds on the crosscutting analysis presented above to outline an approach for analysis
of three types of energy-related emissions_sulfur oxides (SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), nitrous oxides (NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and carbon dioxide (CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The focus on these three emission categories reflects a similar focus in recent U.S. legislation and international
agreements, most notably the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and the Framework Convention on Climate Change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department recognizes that there are other types of emissions, such as particulates, carbon monoxide, air toxins,
volatile organic compounds, solid wastes, and water discharges associated with energy use. Moreover, consideration
of the entire fuel cycle may reveal additional environmental externalities at the extraction or transportation
stages of the cycle. The Department welcomes comment and evidence regarding the importance of other types of externalities
that may arise through these and other emissions pathways that are not discussed below. Comments that are structured
so as to address the same generic- and externality- specific issues raised in this notice, while also identifying
other issues unique to particular pollutants or media, would be particularly helpful. Each of the discussions of
the individual pollutants addresses a common set of issues as well as points specific to that emissions category.
The common issues are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issue 10: The local, regional, national, and global externalities associated with each type of emission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issue 11: The impact of a change in appliance efficiency standards on emissions, taking account of both direct impacts
and the indirect effects arising from existing regulatory structures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issue 12: Evidence regarding the impact of change in emissions on the level of environmental damage to external parties.
Alternatively, if damage cannot be estimated directly, evidence regarding cost-based measures available as surrogates.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issue 13: The impact and relevance of a change in appliance efficiency standards on the emission control obligations
of external parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, it is important to note that the relationship between price and marginal cost discussed as a crosscutting
issue will be relevant to the determination of whether an application of an incremental externality value is appropriate
in those cases where an environmental or energy security externality is identified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Sulfur Dioxide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sulfur dioxide emissions are implicated in environmental effects at the local, regional, and global level. At the
local level, sulfur dioxide is one of the criteria pollutants for which ambient air quality standards are established
under the Clean Air Act. At the regional level, sulfur dioxide is a precursor of acid rain, an issue addressed in Title
IV of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. At the global level, the 1992 Supplementary Scientific Assessment of Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change identifies sulfate aerosols as a potentially significant offset to greenhouse warming that
may be caused by increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on its present information, the Department believes that attention in this rulemaking should focus on externalities
related to the acid precipitation pathway, and therefore on the regional effects. On the local level, there is already
widespread attainment with ambient air quality standards for sulfur dioxide. On the global level, the effect of sulfur
dioxide emissions as an offset to greenhouse warming remains speculative, and its value may be undercut by its extremely
short duration relative to warming from greenhouse gases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The acid precipitation issue is addressed in Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Beginning in the year
2000, its provisions implement a national cap on utility sulfur dioxide emissions of 8.9 million tons together with
a system of tradable allowances for allocating the burden of emissions reduction in a cost-effective manner. The
cap reflects a reduction of roughly 50 percent from 1980 emission levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department expects that the national emissions cap will be binding and, concomitantly, that allowance prices
will be positive. The Department notes that allowance transactions at positive prices are being recorded in increasing
number, and there are no known projections that suggest a non-binding cap. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under a binding cap, reductions in SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions at one location due to reductions in electricity demand would free up emissions allowances, the use of which
could increase allowable emissions at other locations, unless allowances were ``banked''. With no change in overall
emissions, the Department has no basis for assuming that alternative appliance standards would cause any change
in environmental damage levels. However, a net national environmental externality benefit could occur if the pattern
of emissions changes across alternative standards is one that systematically reallocates emissions from locations
where they inflict low marginal damage to locations where they inflict high marginal damage. Based on its current
information, the Department would assume that emissions reallocation from reduced electricity demand is environmentally
neutral. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the Department were to determine that emissions reallocation was not environmentally neutral, the development
of damage estimates would become an issue. In this case, the Department would rely heavily on the current criteria
document for sulfur dioxide, and on the report of the recent National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program (NAPAP),
a 10-year, $500 Million assessment effort. The Department welcomes comment on these and other potential sources
of damage information.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department also solicits comment on the possibility that the current binding national cap on SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions will become non-binding during the time period affected by appliance standards as a result of technology
improvements or cost reduction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to economic externalities, the Department notes that changes in electricity demand could affect the
market price of allowances. A change in allowance prices might affect the manner in which external parties elect to
meet their control obligations, but would not affect the obligations themselves.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is also an acid rain precursor. Finally, changes in tropospheric ozone levels, by changing total column ozone, may
affect the amount of ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation reaching the earth's surface. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on its present information, the Department believes that attention in this rulemaking should address all three
of these externality pathways. According to EPA (1993), the primary ambient air quality standard for tropospheric
ozone is violated more than one time per year in areas where 66 million Americans live. As noted in the discussion of
sulfur dioxide, acid precipitation is another issue of significant national and international concern. The potential
importance of the UVB issue is underlined by the fact that concern surrounding the potential damages from a projected
increase in UVB at the earth's surface was the major reason motivating the phaseout of chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's),
required by the Montreal Protocol to the Vienna Convention and the CAAA of 1990. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to acid precipitation, the Department would consider the same factors and information sources as outlined
above for sulfur dioxide. However, the regulatory structure for NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions outlined in Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 is built around low NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 burner technology requirements rather than an emissions cap. Therefore, the Department would not presume that national
NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions were insensitive to changes in electricity demand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the ambient air quality standards, the Department believes that three main issues must be considered.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The regulatory structure and damages from emissions changes in attainment areas (those areas not violating
the ambient air quality standards) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 transport from outside of an area on ambient air quality conditions in non-attainment areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the first and second points, the Department notes that roughly one-third of the nation's coal-fired
power plants and one-half of its gas- and oil-fired power plants are located in non-attainment areas. These are the
types of generating plants that, together with non-utility stationary sources and vehicles, are the sources of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Attainment areas: Abstracting from the issue of transport into non-attainment areas, the Department would rely
heavily on the information underlying the existing ambient standards for tropospheric ozone. These standards were
issued in early 1993. However, at the time the standards were issued, EPA noted that new studies, done after finalization
of the criteria document on which the standards were based, might suggest health effects at lower concentration levels.
The Department welcomes comment on whether and how these newer studies, which have yet to be formally evaluated by
the EPA, should be reflected in a damage assessment. The Department's damage assessment will also consider non-health
impacts drawing on studies included in the criteria document underlying the latest standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Non-attainment areas: In non-attainment areas, reductions in electricity demand affect the level of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions in several ways. Any new generating plants in ozone non-attainment areas that are needed to meet growing
electricity demand would, under the regulatory structure of Title I of the Clean Air Act, be required to fully offset
their NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions before they could begin operation. Alternatively, changes in electricity demand could simply affect
the operation rate of existing plants, without triggering offset requirements for the operating company. In this
latter case, the initial effect would be an increase in emissions. However, Title I also specifies milestones, or
progress requirements, for emissions reduction in non-attainment areas. These requirements are applicable to
NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in serious and severe non-attainment areas. If these progress requirements were binding, a change in the level of
emissions from the operation of existing power plants could affect the level of reductions that State Implementation
Plans would require from other types of sources in order to meet these requirements. From this perspective, a change
in appliance efficiency standards could change the control obligations of parties unrelated to appliance purchase
decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To develop its analysis on a national scale, DOE will try to develop information regarding the extent to which each
of the cases described above characterizes prevailing conditions. In order to develop an acceptable basis for estimating
the external benefits associated with NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emission reductions in both attainment and non-attainment areas, DOE will be seeking more information on the likely
marginal effects of appliance standards on net emissions and the marginal control costs required to meet non-attainment
area progress requirements. DOE will also be seeking better data on how damages and control costs might vary seasonally,
which may increase or decrease the estimated benefits of particular types of appliance efficiency standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, DOE recognizes the concern that transport of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions from attainment areas may affect ozone concentrations in non-attainment areas, even though they do not
trigger offsets either through the new source program or via progress requirements. DOE welcomes information and
analysis regarding the importance of this issue for a national evaluation of externality damage, and recommended
approaches for incorporating it into the quantitative analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the effect of increased tropospheric ozone concentrations on the level of UVB at the surface, represents
a potentially favorable externality. The Department welcomes comment on the inclusion of this pathway in the externality
analysis, and on the use of information developed in the context of various rulemakings and assessments related to
the impacts of stratospheric ozone depletion to estimate marginal damages from reduced ozone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

c. Carbon Dioxide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department believes that the potential for climate change due to an enhanced greenhouse effect, a global scale
issue, is the only relevant externality pathway for carbon dioxide emissions. Clearly, this is a high priority issue.
In 1992, the world community completed negotiations for a Framework Convention on Climate Change. This convention
has already been signed by 152 nations and should achieve a sufficient number of ramifications to enter into force
by the spring of 1994.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Within the United States, President Clinton and Vice-President Gore have both identified the threat of climate change
as the environmental issue having the highest priority for the nation and the world. The President, on Earth Day 1993,
announced our nation's commitment to return its emissions of greenhouse gases to their 1990 levels by the year 2000.
On October 19, 1993, the Administration released a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Climate Change Action Plan
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

 emissions, energy-related emissions of carbon dioxide are not presently subject to formal regulatory requirements
that go beyond emissions monitoring and reporting. The Administration's action plan does not include proposals
for any such requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Carbon dioxide emissions in the energy sector are proportionally related to the level of use and type of fossil fuel.
For electricity, the Department intends to estimate the effect of a change in electricity use on carbon dioxide by
evaluating the ``average'' fuel mix used to supply marginal changes in electricity demand throughout the country.
The Department welcomes comments and suggestions regarding these calculations. While the absence of existing regulatory
programs and the simple relationships between primary energy use and emissions simplify the externality analysis
compared to that applicable to SO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the effect of these concentrations on the both the global climate and the U.S. climate, and the timing of any such effects
are all highly uncertain. The effects of changes in climate on human activities and unmanaged ecosystems are even
more uncertain. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the difficulties in estimating the impacts of global climate change, which is a necessary preliminary step
in estimating marginal damages from emissions changes, only the most rudimentary calculations have been made. Studies
made by the EPA (1989), Nordhaus (1991 and 1992) and Cline (1992) are particularly noteworthy. These authors candidly
admit the preliminary and often speculative nature of their calculations, and their inability to estimate impacts
for important categories of damages, such as impacts on unmanaged ecosystems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on its present evaluation, the Department believes that the existing literature does not provide a sufficient
basis for developing estimates of marginal damage. Therefore, the Department is considering using revealed willingness-to-pay
for emissions reductions as a proxy to represent the social value of emissions reduction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The October 1993 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Climate Change Action Plan
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 represents the most aggressive national policy statement on emissions reductions to date. The major portion of energy-related
actions in the plan aim to increase end-use efficiency. These programs are generally voluntary in nature, and rely
on the attractive economics of the targeted energy-efficiency improvements to attract public participation. It
is projected that reprogramming federal expenditures of $1.9 billion into these areas will encourage private investments
of approximately $61 billion (undiscounted 1991 dollars) through the end of the decade. These investments are projected
to reduce energy costs (undiscounted 1991 dollars) by $60 billion through the end of the decade, and by an additional
$207 billion though 2010. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the plan calls only for investments in efficiency projects that have a high rate of return, and generally does
not mandate these investments in the event that private parties judge them to be unattractive, it should not impose
any net costs on the private sector. The exclusion of measures that would impose net costs on the private sector could
itself suggest that, at present, the willingness to pay for emission reductions is at or near zero. The Department
notes, however, that the plan reflects only those actions taken to achieve a near-term objective. The President and
Vice-President have noted that the plan is only a first step. Moreover, it is not clear what amendments or protocols
may be made to the Climate Convention, and on what timescale. For these reasons, an evaluation of willingness-to-pay
implicit in the action plan may not provide an adequate basis for evaluating the longer term willingness-to-pay for
sustained emissions reduction. The Department notes that estimates of the long-run cost of emissions reduction
varies widely, with bottom-up engineering models generally providing much lower cost estimates than top-down economic
models.

The literature on this subject identifies five main avenues through which energy security externalities can be generated.
Authors generally reach widely varying conclusions about their significance. DOE intends to study each of these
five areas and invites comments on their significance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The importance of several of the pathways listed below depends partially or wholly on the amount oil prices rise in
response to an oil supply disruption. Thus, as a part of its study of energy security externality values, DOE will consider
the likelihood of a disruption, its size, excess production capacity in other regions of the world, and how the price
shock associated with the disruption might be mitigated by drawing down strategic petroleum stockpiles. DOE invites
comments on the best approach to study these issues.

Gross Domestic Product losses resulting from oil price shocks:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Increased world oil prices caused by supply disruptions may cause macroeconomic shocks to the economy that result
in unemployment and Gross Domestic Product losses. Different studies reach different conclusions regarding the
significance of oil price shocks on macroeconomic performance. For example, a DOE study (1987) cites macroeconomic
stabilization as one justification for energy security policy. In contrast, a study by Bohi (1991) finds little,
if any, link between oil price shocks and macroeconomic performance.

Inflationary losses that accompany oil price rises:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If oil prices rise, then the rate of inflation in the economy increases. Policies to fight inflation can cause increased
unemployment and heighten Gross Domestic Product losses. Further, because many government payments are indexed
to inflation, oil price shocks can increase the size of the budget deficit. DOE intends to treat these inflationary
losses as part of the Gross Domestic Product loss component cited previously.

Monopsony price effects:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Some economists argue that decreased domestic oil consumption will lower world oil prices and reduce payments for
imported oil. The reduced U.S. payments for imported oil benefit U.S. and foreign consumers, but they hurt domestic
and foreign producers. From a U.S.-centric accounting stance, this outcome would be beneficial because the U.S.
consumes more oil than it produces. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adopting a U.S.-centric stance might be problematic in light of continuing U.S. policies to encourage free trade.
For example, U.S. exports of products other than oil to both oil exporting countries and other countries could be reduced
as the effects of a reduction in the value of oil imports work through the trading system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recognizing that monopsony-like arguments could be raised to justify externality values for many types of imported
goods, DOE intends to consider whether there is anything special about oil that justifies an externality for it, while
excluding one for other products.

Terms of trade effect: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Decreased oil imports would improve the balance of trade and strengthen the U.S. dollar. This would leave U.S. consumers
unambiguously better off. This balance-of-trade effect is not considered in private decision-making. However,
like the monopsony effect, counting this as an externality raises broader issues regarding free trade. DOE intends
to consider whether there is anything special about oil that justifies an externality value for it, while excluding
one for other products.

Financing of government strategic stockpiles and military operations associated with oil: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some analysts have suggested that the costs of stocking the strategic petroleum reserve and, more importantly, maintaining
the military power needed to minimize oil supply disruptions are an additional source of externalities. DOE intends
to study this source of externality in more detail, with particular emphasis on whether the size of the change in import
dependence that might be attributed to alternative appliance efficiency standards would have any effect on government
expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to these quantifiable aspects of energy security externalities, some analysts contend that reduced
oil consumption will increase U.S. flexibility in conducting foreign policy. DOE intends to consider this issue,
recognizing that any benefit here would again relate to the size of the impact of the efficiency standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issue 19: The impact of incremental appliance efficiency standards on oil consumption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A central issue in trying to estimate the energy security value to reduced oil imports is the quantitative effect of
incremental efficiency standards on domestic oil consumption. The appliances being considered in this rule affect
oil consumption either directly, as is the case with oil-fired furnaces, or indirectly by reducing the use of oil to
generate electricity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1990, according to the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Annual Energy Outlook for 1993 (AEO93), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
about 2 percent of total U.S. oil consumption was used for residential space heating. By 2010, the same source projects
that oil used for residential space heating will decrease significantly, and account for only about 1 percent of a
higher total oil consumption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current efficiency standard for residential oil-fired furnaces is 78 percent. Moving from the current standard
to 95 percent, for example would after complete stock replacement, reduce oil consumption in this category by less
than 20 percent, and by less if there is a ``rebound'' effect. Marginal changes in this standard could have only an extremely
small effect on total oil consumption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of appliance standards that affect electricity consumption, the amount by which oil consumption is reduced
depends upon the fuels used to generate electricity. According to the AEO93, about 4 percent of the primary energy
consumption used for electricity generation in 1990 was oil-based. That percentage is projected to remain approximately
constant through 2010. Because oil's share of electricity generation is so small, changes in appliance efficiency
standards for electric appliances will not significantly alter total oil consumption in the nation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the national fuel mix used in 1990, each kilowatt hour of electricity saved will reduce oil consumption by
0.000072 barrels. Given this ratio, each dollar of externality value attached to a barrel of oil translates into only
0.007 cents per kilowatt hour on a national average basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Oil-based electricity might be significant in some regions of the country. Additionally, oil tends to be used for
peaking power. DOE intends to study whether regional and peak-load considerations might cause significant divergences
from the national ratio of barrels of oil per kilowatt hour. However, because the national ratio is so low, it seems
unlikely that even taking into account regional and peak-load considerations could result in large energy security
externality values for electric appliances even if a high per-barrel externality value were deemed appropriate.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE believes that the preponderant share of reduced oil consumption caused by incremental appliance efficiency
standards, will come from imports. The price of oil is set in a world market and domestic energy producers supply as
much oil as is profitable given that world price. Unless appliance efficiency standards significantly affect the
world oil price, domestic production will remain largely unchanged and imports will fall. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has considered, in several recent policy exercises, the impact of changes in domestic oil consumption
on world market prices. The change in price determines how reduced consumption is split between reduced imports and
reduced domestic production. Current modeling generally shows that domestic production falls by only about ten
percent of the decrease in domestic consumption. The Department of Interior's Minerals Management Service also
studied this issue in detail as a part of their 1992 5&hyph;Year Leasing Program, and reached similar conclusions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issue 18: The possibility of energy security externalities associated with non-oil fuels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department does not believe that there are comparable energy security externalities associated with fuels other
than oil. That is because non-oil fuels consumed in the U.S. are obtained primarily from domestic sources. The prices
of these fuels are primarily determined in national markets, and are not particularly susceptible to price spikes
caused by supply disruptions in other areas of the world. Because of these factors, DOE does not intend to consider
energy security externalities for fuels other than oil. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, it is important to note that the generic issue of the relationship between price and marginal cost outlined
in the Crosscutting Issues section must be considered in the determination of whether an application of an incremental
externality value is appropriate in those cases where an energy security externality related to the use of oil in electricity
generation is identified. However, given the competitive market structure of the fuel oil industry, the Department,
based on its current information, presumes that oil sold directly to residential end-users is competitively priced.

A DOE official will be designated to preside at the hearing. The hearing will not be a judicial or an evidentiary-type
hearing, but will be conducted in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 533 and section 336 of the Act. At the conclusion of all initial
oral statements at each day of the hearing, each person who has made an oral statement will be given the opportunity
to make a rebuttal statement, subject to time limitations. The rebuttal statement will be given in the order in which
the initial statements were made. The official conducting the hearing will accept additional comments or questions
from those attending, as time permits. Any interested person may submit to the presiding official written questions
to be asked of any person making a statement at the hearing. The presiding official will determine whether the question
is relevant and whether time limitations permit it to be presented for answer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further questioning of speakers will be permitted by DOE. The presiding official will afford any interested person
an opportunity to question, with respect to disputed issues of material fact, other interested persons who made oral
presentations as well as employees of the United States Government who have made written or oral presentations relating
to the proposed rule. This opportunity will be afforded after any rebuttal statements to the extent that the presiding
official determines that such questioning is likely to result in a more timely and effective resolution of disputed
issues of material fact. If the time provided is insufficient or inconvenient, DOE will consider affording an additional
opportunity for questioning at a mutually convenient time. Persons interested in making use of this opportunity
must submit their request to the presiding official no later than shortly after the completion of any rebuttal statements
and be prepared to state specific justification, including why the issue is one of disputed fact and how the proposed
questions would expedite their resolution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any further procedural rules regarding proper conduct of the hearing will be announced by the presiding official.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A transcript of the hearing will be made and the entire record of this rulemaking, including the transcript, will be
retained by DOE and made available for inspection at the DOE Freedom of Information Reading Room as provided at the
beginning of this notice. Any person may purchase a copy of the transcript from the transcribing reporter.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model
747 series airplanes. This proposal would require modification of the fire extinguishing system in the number two
engine strut. This proposal is prompted by reports of chafing of the fire extinguishing tubes in a certain inboard
strut to wing area. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent chafing of the fire extinguishing
tube; such chafing could cause cracking of the tube and consequently produce a hole in the fire extinguishing tube,
which could prevent the proper distribution of the fire extinguisher agent within the nacelle in the event of a fire.

Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On June 17, 1992, the FAA issued AD 92&hyph;14&hyph;07, amendment 39&hyph;8289 (57 FR 31433, July 16, 1994), applicable
to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes, to require repetitive inspections to detect damage of the tubes of the
engine fire extinguishing system in the number two and number three engine struts; replacement or repair, if necessary;
and reorientation of the clamp. That Ad also requires modification of the engine fire extinguishing system in the
number two and number three engine struts, which, when accomplished, terminates the inspection requirements. The
modification was required to be accomplished on all affected airplanes no later than February 20, 1993. That action
was prompted by multiple reports of the support clamps in the number two and number three engine struts chafing a hole
in the tubes of the engine fire extinguishing system. The requirements of that AD are intended to prevent inadequate
distribution of the fire extinguishing agent within the nacelle in the event of a fire.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the issuance of that AD, the FAA has received reports of chafing of the tubes and/or cracking of the rubber blocks
that are an integral part of the clamps in the inboard strut to wing area in the number two engine strut. (The tube and
the rubber blocks were installed as part of the modification required by AD 92&hyph;14&hyph;07.) As a result of the
chafing, one of the tubes on one airplane cracked approximately six inches from the forward end. Investigation revealed
that the cracked tube had a notch near the cracked area of the tube that had been formed due to contact with a ground stud.
This notch may have initiated the crack in the tube. Further investigation revealed that the rubber blocks, which
support the tubes, were cracked between the stand-off spacers and the tubes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cause of such chafing and cracking has been attributed to movement between the spacer and the tube. This movement
exceeded the flexibility of the rubber and stressed the rubber block, which subsequently pinched and tore the rubber
block of the clamp. Such pinching and tearing could cause the clamp to fail and could lead to chafing of the fir extinguishing
tube.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chafing of the fire extinguishing tube, if not corrected, could result in cracking of the fire extinguishing tube
and consequently produce a hole in the fire extinguishing tube, which could prevent the proper distribution of the
fire extinguishing agent within the nacelle in the event of a fire.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;26A2226, dated June 30, 1994, which describes
procedures for modification of the fire extinguishing system in the number two engine strut. This modification entails
removing and replacing the fire extinguishing tube with a new, improved tube (for Group 1 and 2 airplanes); removing
and reinstalling the existing fire extinguishing tube (for Group 3 airplanes); and replacing the channel and rubber
blocks; and reworking the forward bracket (for Group 1, 2, and 3 airplanes). This modification would revise the geometry
of the rubber block and the tube, which would increase the flexibility of the rubber block and would increase the clearance
between the tube and the adjacent ground studs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would require modification of the fire extinguishing system in the number two engine strut.
The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the alert service bulletin described previously.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
There are approximately 145 Boeing Model 747 series airplanes equipped with General Electric CF6&hyph;80C2 engines
of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 2 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected
by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 3 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions,
and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost
to the operators. Based on thee figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be
$330, or $165 per airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The USEPA proposes to approve the State implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Indiana to satisfy
Federal requirements for an approvable nonattainment area new source review (NSR) SIP. The USEPA is proposing to
approve the recodified version of the Indiana permitting rules to replace those in the existing SIP. The USEPA is also
proposing to remove references in the Code of Federal Regulations to the construction ban imposed in Lake and Porter
Counties for failure to have an approved ozone plan since the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 removed this ban. In the
final rules section of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
, the USEPA is approving these actions as a direct final rule without prior proposal because USEPA views these as noncontroversial
actions and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is set forth in the direct final
rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to that direct final rule, no further activity is contemplated
in relation to this proposed rule. If USEPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and
all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on the proposed rule. USEPA will not
institute a second comment period on this notice. Any parties interested in commenting on this document should do
so at this time.

The Commission requests comments on a petition filed by PDB Broadcasting, permittee of a new FM station, Channel 299A,
Woodville, Mississippi, seeking the substitution of Channel 299C3 for Channel 299A at Woodville and modification
of PDB's construction permit to specify operation on the higher powered channel. To accommodate the allotment of
Channel 299C3 at Woodville, we also propose to substitute Channel 274A for Channel 257A at Jena, Louisiana, and the
modification of Station WJNA (FM)'s license to specify the change in channel; and to substitute Channel 257A for Channel
300A at Clayton, Louisiana. The license of Station WJNA(FM), Jena, Louisiana, has been ordered to show cause why its
license should not be modified as described above.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This rule establishes major policies with respect to contracting and subcontracting with designated entities.
With respect to prime contracting, it ensures that designated entities are fully considered for awards. Also, the
consolidation or bundling of contract requirements is controlled. With respect to subcontracting, it requires
specifying mandatory goals in solicitations for subcontracting with designated entities, evaluating designated
entity subcontracting goals proposed by offerors, and including in contracts the designated entity subcontracting
goals in addition to the goals included in the subcontracting plan required by 15 U.S.C. 637(d) as implemented in FAR
Subpart 19.7. NFS Subpart 1819.70 and the clause at 1852.219&hyph;76 are substantially revised. A new subsection
is added to NFS 1815.608. NFS 1870.303, Appendix I, Chapter 301, is amended to cover proposal evaluation.

available in its entirety on a subscription basis from the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office,
Washington, DC 20402. Cite GPO Subscription Stock Number 933&hyph;003&hyph;00000&hyph;1. It is not distributed

Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has determined that this rule is significant under E.O. 12866. This
regulation is needed, because it provides the NASA policy regarding contracting and subcontracting with designated
entities. Regarding prime contract awards, the policy ensures that designated entities are fully considered for
awards. Regarding subcontracting issues, the policy requires specifying mandatory goals in solicitations for
subcontracting with designated entities, evaluating designated entity subcontracting goals proposed by offerors,
and including in contracts the designated entity subcontracting goals in addition to the goals included in the subcontracting
plan required by 15 U.S.C. 637(d) as implemented in FAR Subpart 19.7. Current regulations do not address these prime
contracting and subcontracting policies. The potential costs for this regulatory action are nominal and are not
quantifiable. Because the subcontracting goals are included in the contract, costs for contracting with or subcontracting
to designated entities would normally be charged to the Government. The potential benefits are the increased direct
awards or subcontracting awards to designated entities which will broaden the base of NASA contractors. The value
of increasing the contract and subcontract opportunities to designated entities cannot be measured, because it
involves not only increases to NASA's business base of qualified and eligible contractors but also additional opportunities
for designated entities to receive a fair proportion of NASA awards to the maximum extent practicable.

In all solicitations which contain the clause at 1852.219&hyph;76, NASA Subcontracting Goal, the contracting officer
is required to prescribe a mandatory goal for the use of ``designated entities'' as subcontractors (See 1819.7005).
Offers will be evaluated on the proposed designated entity subcontracting goal, in comparison to the goal specified
in the solicitation, and on the offeror's proposed method of achieving the goal. Evaluation of the designated entity
subcontracting goal shall be accomplished, at a minimum, as a separate element under a management subfactor under
the Mission Suitability factor so that it may have an impact on the source selection decision.

This subpart implements legislative provisions (Public Laws 101&hyph;144, 101&hyph;507, and 102&hyph;389) which
require the NASA Administrator to ensure, to the fullest extent possible, that at least eight percent (8%) of Federal
funding for prime and subcontracts awarded in support of authorized programs, including the space station by the
time operational status is obtained, be made available to small business concerns or other organizations owned or
controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals (within the meaning of section 8(a)(5) and (6)
of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a) (5) and (6)), including Historically Black Colleges and Universities
and minority educational institutions. For purposes of this subpart, socially and economically disadvantaged
individuals shall be deemed to include women.

General policy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The Congress has indicated its desire to increase the participation of designated entities in the aerospace industry,
particularly as NASA contractors and subcontractors. The agency's goal is to award to such entities at least 8% of
the funding provided for prime contracts and subcontracts in support of authorized programs by the end of fiscal year
1994. The participation of NASA prime contractors, through their subcontracting practices, is essential to meeting
this goal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The 8% goal applies to the annual dollar obligations of the agency. It is not an absolute goal for each center or program
or an absolute percentage to be placed in each contract containing a subcontracting plan. While some procurement
requirements (contracts) offer subcontracting opportunities for designated entities equal to 8% of the contract
value, others will offer greater, and some less, subcontracting opportunities. The aggregate comprises the agency's
total accomplishment in response to the legislative mandate.

Prime contracting policy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Contracting officers must seek out designated entities as sources and give full consideration to these entities
to satisfy requirements in all NASA procurements. Since contracts with eligible 8(a) firms under the Small Business
Administration section 8(a) program count toward the attainment of NASA's goal, contracting officers must make
maximum use of this program in awarding prime contracts (see procedures set forth in (FAR) 48 CFR Subpart 19.8).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Existing contracts or options will normally not be reduced in scope or otherwise restructured to increase opportunities
for designated entities at the prime contract level. In rare instances, taking such action may be accomplished with
approval of the Associate Administrator for Procurement.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Prior to effecting a contracting consolidation valued at $5 million or more, including options, which will not be
exclusively reserved for small or 8(a) firms, an impact assessment on the effects of consolidation on present and
future contracting and subcontracting opportunities of designated entities shall be prepared by the center, submitted
to Headquarters Code HS, concurred in by Code K and the cognizant Associate Administrator, and approved by the Associate
Deputy Administrator (Technical).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Protests involving size status and those involving designated entity status for other than women-owned businesses
shall be referred to the U.S. Small Business Administration for handling. Protests to NASA regarding women-owned
businesses claiming designated entity status shall be resolved by the agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Public Laws 101&hyph;144, 101&hyph;507, and 102&hyph;389 state that the status of a small business concern or
other organization as a designated entity is determined by whether the entity is owned or controlled by socially and
economically disadvantaged individuals, including women. To provide consistency with section 8(a)(4) of the Small
Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)(4)), NASA applies a restrictive interpretation of this legislation by requiring
ownership and control by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.

Subcontracting policy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) All contracts which are required to include a subcontracting plan (see (FAR) 48 CFR 19.702) must contain a separate
percentage goal for using designated entities as subcontractors. This separate goal will not be entered on the subcontracting
plan but will be specified in the clause at 1852.219&hyph;76, NASA Subcontracting Goal. The total dollars planned
to be subcontracted to small disadvantaged business concerns stated in the subcontracting plan will be included
in determining the designated entity subcontracting goal. The designated entity subcontracting goal also includes
planned subcontracts with small business concerns owned and controlled by women, Historically Black Colleges and
Universities, and other minority educational institutions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) After a careful assessment of the statement of work associated with each procurement, contracting officers would
insert in solicitations that have subcontracting opportunities an appropriate subcontracting goal for designated
entities. The contracting officer shall confer with the small business specialist during the assessment stage since
the specialist has knowledge and information regarding the pool of designated entities available to fulfill the
subcontracting opportunities. The goals should be set at a level that can be reasonably achieved by the contractor
expending good faith efforts to use designated entities as subcontractors to the maximum practicable extent. The
designated entity subcontracting goals will be stated as mandatory goals in solicitations.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(c) Contracting officers shall include the mandatory designated entity subcontracting goal in the presolicitation
notice (see (FAR) 48 CFR 5.204) and in any draft Request for Proposal that is issued. The contracting officer and the
small business specialist will consider all comments received in response to either the presolicitation notice
or the draft Request for Proposal prior to determining the mandatory goal in the formal solicitation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) In negotiated acquisitions, an initial proposal will not be rejected as unacceptable solely as a result of an offeror
proposing a goal that is less than the mandatory goal. Subsequent to the evaluation of proposals, in which the proposed
goal shall be evaluated as a separate element under a management subfactor under the Mission Suitability factor,
consistent with NFS 1815.608&hyph;72, the contracting officer shall negotiate with the apparently successful
offeror(s) to establish the designated entity subcontracting goal to be inserted in the contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) If a bidder, in response to a sealed bid solicitation, takes exception to the specified mandatory subcontracting
goal, the bid shall not be rejected as nonresponsive. If the bidder is selected for award, the contracting officer
may request the bidder to offer a revised designated entity subcontracting goal by a specified date. If the bidder's
response indicates that the bidder does not intend to use its best efforts to provide the designated entities the maximum
practicable opportunity to participate in performance of the contract, the contracting officer may find the bidder
nonresponsible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) In solicitations, proposals, and resulting contracts, the designated entity subcontracting goal should be
stated as a percentage of the total contract value rather than as a percentage of the total planned subcontracting
dollars. Subcontracting plans shall conform to the requirements of (FAR) 48 CFR 52.219&hyph;9, i.e., the goals included
in the plans shall be expressed in terms of percentages of total planned subcontracting dollars. Also, SF 294 and SF
295 reports shall continue to be completed in accordance with the instructions on these forms.

(a) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at 1852.219&hyph;73, Small Business and Small Disadvantaged
Business Subcontracting Plan, in solicitations containing the clause at (FAR) 48 CFR 52.219&hyph;9. Insert in the
last sentence the number of calendar days after the contracting officer's request that the offeror must submit a complete
plan. When offerors are to include subcontracting plans in their initial offers as contemplated by (FAR) 48 CFR 19.705&hyph;2(d),
or if a noncompetitive solicitation will be issued, the contracting officer may use the provision with its Alternate
I.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.219&hyph;75, Small Business and Small Disadvantaged
Business Subcontracting Reporting, in solicitations and contracts containing the clause at (FAR) 48 CFR 52.219&hyph;9.
Those current contracts containing subcontracting plans and designated by NASA Headquarters (Code HC) shall be
amended to require quarterly submission of the SF 295.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) In all solicitations and contracts which contain the clause at (FAR) 48 CFR 52.219&hyph;9, Small Business and
Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan, the contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.219&hyph;76,
NASA Subcontracting Goal, when contracting by negotiation. In all solicitations and contracts which contain the
clause at (FAR) 48 CFR 52.219&hyph;9, the contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.219&hyph;76 with its
Alternate I, when contracting by sealed bidding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) In solicitations and contracts which do not contain the clause at (FAR) 48 CFR 52.219&hyph;9, and when the contract
value is expected to exceed the small purchase limitation, the contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.219&hyph;76
with its Alternate II, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In solicitations and contracts which do not contain the clause at (FAR) 48 CFR 52.219&hyph;9, and when the contract
value is expected to exceed $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction), and the contractor is a small business which
is not a designated entity, the contracting officer may use the clause at 1852.219&hyph;76 instead of the clause at
1852.219&hyph;76 with its Alternate II. The basic clause should be used when the contracting officer determines
that the procurement offers subcontracting opportunities with designated entities.

of these specific subfactors is not intended to be restrictive or all inclusive. However, as stated in NFS 1815.608&hyph;72,
evaluation of the designated entities subcontracting goal shall be accomplished, at a minimum, as a separate element
under a management subfactor under the Mission Suitability factor. The nature and thrust of the requirements and
objectives of the procurement may logically call for the use of some subfactors titled and described in a somewhat
different manner than those described below:

e. (1) In structuring evaluation subfactors and elements, emphasis should be placed on identification of significant
discriminators, or ``key swingers''_the essential information required to support a source selection decision.
Too many subfactors and elements are detrimental to effective evaluation of proposals and may result in a leveling
or averaging out of scores over all proposals. To avoid this negative effect, the number of subfactors under Mission
Suitability shall be no more than 4 and the number of elements no more than 8 except for the separate evaluation of designated
entities either as a separate element or a separate subfactor under Mission Suitability (See NFS 1815.608&hyph;72).
Other evaluation factors shall also be limited to only essential subfactors and elements. Further, care should be
taken to avoid overlap and redundancy by clearly defining each evaluation subfactor and element. Avoiding such overlap
assures an offeror is not scored in two or more areas for the same work.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On August 29, 1994, the President signed the ``Hazardous Materials Transportation Authorization Act of 1994'' (the
Act). Section 122 of the Act requires RSPA to examine requirements that pertain to open head fiber drum packaging in
domestic transportation. Specifically, RSPA is to determine whether there are standards other than the performance-based
standards adopted under RSPA's rulemaking Docket No. HM&hyph;181, that will provide an equal or greater level of
safety for the transportation of liquid hazardous materials. The purpose of this ANPRM is to solicit comments and
proposals for alternate standards for open head fiber drum packaging.

SEC. 122. USE OF FIBER DRUM PACKAGING. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) INITIATION OF RULEMAKING PROCEEDING._Not later than the 60th day following the date of enactment of this Act,
the Secretary of Transportation shall initiate a rulemaking proceeding to determine whether the requirements of
section 5103(b) of title 49, United States Code (relating to regulations for safe transportation) as they pertain
to open head fiber drum packaging can be met for the domestic transportation of liquid hazardous materials (with respect
to those classifications of liquid hazardous materials transported by such drums pursuant to regulations in effect
on September 30, 1991) with standards other than the performance-oriented packaging standards adopted under docket
number HM&hyph;181 contained in part 178 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) ISSUANCE OF STANDARDS._If the Secretary of Transportation determines, as a result of the rulemaking proceeding
initiated under subsection (a), that a packaging standard other than the performance-oriented packaging standards
referred to in subsection (a) will provide an equal or greater level of safety for the domestic transportation of liquid
hazardous materials than would be provided if such performance-oriented packaging standards were in effect, the
Secretary shall issue regulations which implement such other standard and which take effect before October 1, 1996.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) COMPLETION OF RULEMAKING PROCEEDING._The rulemaking proceeding initiated under subsection (a) shall be completed
before October 1, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) LIMITATIONS._
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The provisions of subsections (a), (b), and (c) shall not apply to packaging for those hazardous materials regulated
by the Department of Transportation as poisonous by inhalation under chapter 51 of title 49, United States Code. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the Secretary of Transportation from issuing or enforcing
regulations for the international transportation of hazardous materials.

Detailed comments and proposals are requested that will assist RSPA in developing an appropriate regulatory proposal
consistent with the requirement quoted above. Of particular importance is the determination called for in paragraph
(b) of Section 122 that a packaging standard to be adopted provide an equal or greater level of safety for domestic transportation
of liquid hazardous materials than would be provided if the performance-oriented packaging standards specified
in 49 CFR part 178 subparts L and M were applied. Any interested person is invited to present a proposal, preferably
in the form of a draft standard, that would assist RSPA in accomplishing the intended effect of this law. The proposal
should include a methodology for evaluating comparative levels of safety and estimates, where available, of cost
differences between present and proposed packaging.

In addition, comments are invited on the issue of whether alternate standards for open head fiber drums should be limited
to domestic transportation of liquid hazardous materials. If packagings authorized by alternate standards would
cost less than the performance standard packaging adopted under HM&hyph;181, but were not authorized for international
shipments, an unfair competition issue could be raised in relation to international trade agreements.

 This notice proposes to allow manufacturers the option 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of installing a manual device that motorists could use to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deactivate the front passenger-side air bag in a vehicle without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rear seats for the purpose of allowing them to place rear-facing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
infant restraints in the front seat. NHTSA research indicates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that rear-facing infant restraints should not be placed in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
front seat of a vehicle equipped with a passenger-side air bag. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This poses a problem because manufacturers are beginning to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
install, and soon will be required to install, passenger-side air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bags in passenger cars and light trucks, some of which have only

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice proposes to allow manufacturers the option of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installing a manual device (hereafter referred to as a ``cutoff 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
device'') that motorists could use to deactivate the front 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
passenger air bag in a vehicle without rear seats for the purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of allowing them to place rear-facing infant restraints in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
front seat. (``Rear-facing infant restraint,'' as used in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice, refers to an infant restraint system (except a car bed) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which is positioned in a vehicle so that the restrained infant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
faces the rear of the vehicle.) NHTSA is issuing this proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because one particular type of child restraint, i.e., a rear-facing infant restraint, should not be placed in the
front seat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a vehicle equipped with a passenger air bag. This poses a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problem because manufacturers are beginning to install, and soon will be required to install, passenger air bags
in vehicles, some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of which have only front seats. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 2, 1993, NHTSA published a final rule amending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standard No. 208, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Occupant Crash Protection, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to specify that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers must install air bags to satisfy the standard's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
automatic crash protection requirements (58 FR 46551). This rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was required by 49 U.S.C. 30127 (recently codified and previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cited as Section 2508 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Efficiency Act of 1991). These requirements for driver and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
passenger air bags are phased-in for both passenger cars and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other vehicles. The phase-in percentage for passenger cars is 95 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent by model year 1997, and all passenger cars beginning with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
model year 1998. The phase-in percentage for trucks, buses, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multipurpose passenger vehicles (other than walk-in van-type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trucks and vehicles designed to be exclusively sold to the United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States Postal Service) with a gross vehicle weight rating of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8,500 pounds or less and an unloaded vehicle weight of 5,500 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pounds or less (collectively referred to as ``light trucks'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
throughout the remainder of this preamble) is 80 percent by model 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year 1998 and all light trucks beginning with model year 1999. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA has already released several documents and completed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
several rulemaking actions addressing the air bag/infant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restraint interaction problem. Based on the preliminary results 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the testing done regarding this problem, NHTSA issued a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consumer Advisory on December 10, 1991, warning owners of rear-facing infant restraints not to use such a restraint
in the front 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seat of a vehicle equipped with a passenger air bag.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since issuing the 1991 Consumer Advisory, NHTSA has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intensified its efforts to work closely and cooperatively with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interested parties on this issue. For example, NHTSA has worked 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to bring about a better understanding of rear-facing infant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restraint/air bag interaction through the auspices of the Society 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Automotive Engineers (SAE) and its technical committees on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
child safety issues. As a result of mutual concerns on the part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of government and industry, the SAE was able to publish consensus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidelines dealing broadly with the interaction of child 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restraint systems (including rear-facing infant restraints) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
air bags. The agency worked with State and local governments to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disseminate the information about the latest, mutually arrived 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at, recommendations concerning rear-facing infant restraint/air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bag interaction. NHTSA has also worked with the American Academy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Pediatrics (AAP), a group of doctors who specialize in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
care of children. As a result, the AAP has disseminated the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warnings about air bags and rear-facing infant restraints to its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40,000 members through its newsletter and Family Shopping Guide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for Car Seats. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the agency has reemphasized its commitment to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
educating the public on this issue. In April 1992, the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reissued its Consumer Information Bulletin, ``Transporting Your 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Children Safely.'' This bulletin provides several pages of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidelines on the use of child restraints in vehicles, including a chart depicting the optimum restraint type for
various sizes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and weights for children. For example, the bulletin recommends 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that from birth to 9&hyph;12 months or 20 pounds, a rear-facing infant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restraint be used. The bulletin also states: ``Rear-facing child 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety seats should always go in the rear seat in cars equipped 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with passenger-side air bags.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In October 1992, based on the final results of the testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mentioned above, NHTSA published a final report describing child 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restraint/passenger air bag interactions (Child 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Restraint/Passenger Air Bag Interaction Strategies, DOT HS 808&hyph;004, October 1992). The report concluded
that rear-facing infant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restraints should not be placed in the front seat of a vehicle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with a passenger air bag. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the October 1992 final report, NHTSA amended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
several safety standards to require warnings concerning the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interaction of air bags and rear-facing infant restraints. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the September 1993 final rule, as described above, the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required that specified information, including information about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proper placement of rear-facing infant restraints, be placed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on labels in vehicles equipped with air bags. This warning label 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be on the sun visor of any vehicle equipped with an air bag 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufactured after September 1, 1994. It also required that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional, more detailed information about air bags be provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the owner's manual. Consumers were again cautioned by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department not to use rear-facing infant restraints in seating positions protected by air bags in an October 28, 1993
news 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
release. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 16, 1994, the agency took a further step to try 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to alert parents to the issue of air bag/rear-facing infant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restraint interaction. It published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule amending Standard No. 213, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Child Restraint Systems
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FR 7643). The amended Standard No. 213 requires that the warning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
label for a rear-facing infant restraint include a warning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against using the restraint in any vehicle seating position 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipped with an air bag. It also requires that the printed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructions for a rear-facing infant restraint include safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information about air bags. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Believing that steps in addition to providing consumers with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information were needed, members of the American Automobile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers Association (AAMA) met with NHTSA on January 24, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994. AAMA asked for the meeting to explore the possibility of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installing an air bag cutoff device to allow rear-facing infant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restraints to be placed in air bag-equipped passenger seating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
positions. AAMA representatives discussed the general concept of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an air bag cutoff device, which could be either automatic or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manual. However, the representatives emphasized that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry is not quite ready to install automatic devices because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
automatic cutoff technology is not yet ready for production. At 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the meeting, AAMA asked whether Standard No. 208 would permit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such devices and, if not permitted, whether the agency would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider initiating rulemaking to permit such devices.

II. Scope of this Notice
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA is concerned that despite its efforts to provide warnings to not place an infant in a rear-facing infant restraint
in the right front seat of a vehicle that has a passenger air bag, these warnings will provide minimal benefit if a parent
chooses to transport his/her infant in a vehicle that is physically unable to accommodate a child any place other than
the front seat, e.g., a vehicle that has no rear seat. Examples of such vehicles are a two-seater sports car and a light
duty truck with only a front seat. It is exclusively for this minority of vehicles that this notice is intended. NHTSA
believes that allowing manufacturers the option to install a manual cutoff device would not unduly diminish the ability
of these vehicles to provide crash protection to the adult population and would avoid the potential problem of air
bag/infant seat interaction.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Legality of Air Bag Cutoff Devices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After the January 1994 meeting with AAMA, the agency examined whether Standard No. 208 currently permits a vehicle
to be equipped with an air bag cutoff device. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standard No. 208 currently requires the front outboard seating positions in passenger cars and light trucks to be
equipped with automatic crash protection systems which protect their occupants by means that require no action by
vehicle occupants. Compliance with the automatic crash protection requirements of Standard No. 208 is determined
in a dynamic crash test. That is, a vehicle must comply with specified injury criteria, as measured on a test dummy,
in a 30 mph barrier crash test. The two types of automatic crash protection currently offered are automatic safety
belts (whose automatic nature helps to assure belt use) and air bags (which supplement safety belts and offer some
protection even when safety belts are not used). The September 1993 final rule will require manufacturers to comply
with the automatic crash protection requirements by installing air bags. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two types of cutoff devices are possible. The first type involves manual technology such as an ``on-off'' switch to
disable the operation of the passenger air bag by moving the switch to the ``OFF'' position. To reactivate, the switch
is then moved to the ``ON'' position. This reactivation may take place manually or it may occur automatically, e.g.,
after deactivation the system reactivates the next time that the ignition is turned on or when a door is opened. The
second type of cutoff device is one that automatically deactivates and reactivates the air bag. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In past agency interpretations of the safety standards, NHTSA has stated that if (1) there are two possible conditions
during a compliance test (e.g., whether a particular device is in the ``ON'' or ``OFF'' position), and (2) the standard
does not specify which test condition is to be used, and (3) the language of the standard as a whole and the standard's
purpose do not imply a limit that would make one of those conditions inappropriate, there is a presumption that the
requirements have to be met in both test conditions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With regard to automatic cutoff devices, the agency expects that manufacturers would design these devices so that
they would automatically ensure that the front passenger air bag is activated during the barrier crash test because
a 50th percentile adult male dummy is in the seat. Thus, there would not be two possible test conditions under those
circumstances. Therefore, if so designed, automatic cutoff devices would be allowed by Standard No. 208. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to manual cutoff devices, two test conditions are possible. In one, the device is in the ``ON'' position
and the air bag is deactivated. In the other, the device is in the ``OFF'' position and the air bag is activated. The position
of a cutoff device is not specified in Standard No. 208, so the presumption arises that the Standard must be met regardless
of whether the device is in the ``ON'' or ``OFF'' position. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, before reaching such a conclusion, the agency considers the language and purpose of the standard to see if
any limits on the test condition are implied. In the past, the agency has found such limits when one or more of the possible
conditions could not occur under normal driving conditions. The purpose of Standard No. 208 is for a vehicle to provide
automatic protection for vehicle occupants at all times when the vehicle is operating. Therefore, if the cutoff device
could be used when the vehicle is being operated, there is no implied limit on the position of the device during the test.
Since the injury criteria presumably would not be met when the air bag has been deactivated, the device would result
in a noncompliance with Standard No. 208. Therefore, the agency concludes that manual cutoff devices are not currently
permitted by Standard No. 208. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The above conclusion about manual cutoff devices applies only to vehicles that comply with the automatic protection
requirement by means of air bags. If a vehicle is voluntarily equipped with air bags, as some light trucks are, the installation
of a manual cutoff device is permitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Decision to Allow Manual Cutoff Devices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA believes that a regulatory dilemma now exists because drivers of two-seater vehicles, i.e., vehicles which
have no designated rear seating positions, might be forced to ignore the cautions against placing an infant in the
front seat. Although some manufacturers may be able to devise an air bag system that would accommodate an infant in
a rear-facing infant restraint placed in close proximity to the dashboard of a vehicle equipped with a passenger air
bag, concerns voiced by the AAMA indicate that, in general, most vehicle manufacturers are concerned that existing
air bag designs do not currently provide the special type of protection needed to avoid injury to infants in rear-facing
infant restraints placed on the front seat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the automatic technologies now under consideration appear too immature for immediate application to the
problem, the agency is proposing to amend Standard No. 208 to permit a manual cutoff device. NHTSA has concluded that
manual cutoff devices should be optional; they should not be mandated. A mandatory installation requirement could
penalize manufacturers that have produced, or intend to produce, a passenger air bag that is not harmful to infants
in rear-facing infant restraints. The agency believes that a mandatory requirement would needlessly stifle innovations
and could impede future advances in air bag technology. In addition, the agency believes that some vehicles with only
one row of seats may allow the seat to be moved far enough rearward so that the combination of air bag type and design and
vehicle seat position does not pose a threat to a child in a rear-facing infant restraint. Thus, a cutoff device would
not be necessary in the vehicle.

V. Details of Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Affected Vehicles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA is proposing to allow manual cutoff devices in passenger cars and light trucks since, as noted above, these vehicles
are required to have passenger air bags by the late 1990s. NHTSA has also tentatively concluded that manual cutoff
devices should be allowed only in passenger cars and light trucks which do not have forward-facing rear seats. If vehicles
are equipped with at least one rear seating position, that position can be used for a rear-facing infant restraint.
Even in vehicles without air bags, NHTSA recommends the rear seat as the optimum location for any child restraint.
Accordingly, NHTSA does not believe that manual cutoff devices should be allowed in vehicles with a forward-facing
rear seat.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA is proposing to require the use of a key to activate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the cutoff device. This would make the device simple and easy to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use, but still require conscious thought and deliberate action on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the part of the user. The agency is proposing use of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ignition key to ensure that the driver of the vehicle is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
person most likely to activate the cutoff device, and thereby 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimize the likelihood of accidental activation. This approach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is similar to that used in Standard No. 118, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Power Operated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Window, Partition and Roof Panel Systems
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, to ensure the safe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation of electrically operated devices. NHTSA requests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments on mandating the use of the ignition key. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA requests comments on other means that would guard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against the inadvertent deactivation of the air bag, while 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
avoiding the possible complexity or inconvenience of the ignition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
key based approach. Examples of other means include a separate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
key from the ignition key, ``keyless'' entry technology responding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to personal identification numbers, the use of ``protected'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
switches that require removing or re-positioning a special safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cap in two or more steps, or other such devices. NHTSA will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider all comments regarding the means to deactivate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
passenger air bag, and will adopt the most practicable approach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible which is consistent with the philosophy that the device 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be as simple and easy to use as possible, consistent with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
goal of preventing inadvertent deactivation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Air Bag Reactivation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA is proposing to require that manual cutoff devices be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed so that, once the cutoff device has been used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deactivate the air bag, the air bag will remain deactivated until 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it is manually reactivated. Mandating manual reactivation would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that once an air bag has been deactivated for the safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of an infant being transported in a rear-facing child restraint 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the front seat, it would remain deactivated for subsequent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trips with the child. NHTSA is concerned, for example, that if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it instead allowed a manually deactivated air bag to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
automatically reactivated, motorists making stop-and-go shopping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trips with infants might forget, after making one of their stops, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the air bag has been automatically reactivated and needs to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be manually deactivated again. The infants would then be at risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if the vehicles were involved in crashes that deployed the air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bags. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the same time, the agency is concerned that the air bag 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be operational whenever it is needed by a non-infant occupant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In an attempt to ensure that air bag protection would be ready 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when needed, NHTSA also proposes to require a yellow warning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
light which would be clearly visible to the driver and any adult 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
passenger (see Section D, Warning Light, below). It would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
illuminate the words, ``AIR BAG OFF,'' whenever the air bag has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been manually deactivated. This warning light would serve as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reminder that the cutoff device should be reset whenever the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle is no longer carrying an infant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notwithstanding its proposal to require that manually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deactivated air bags reactivate by manual means only, NHTSA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requests comments on whether it should address the problem of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensuring both infant and non-infant safety by mandating that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manually deactivated air bag be automatically reactivated upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the occurrence of some subsequent event. The subsequent event 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that triggers the automatic reactivation of the air bag could be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the next restarting of the vehicle. However, such a design could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pose an unnecessary burden and risk in the example given above of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
motorists making stop-and-go shopping trips. The motorists must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restart their vehicles numerous times on such trips. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combination of that fact and the automatic reactivation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
air bag each time the vehicles are restarted would multiply the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occasions on which the motorists might forget to protect their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
infants by deactivating the air bag. To address this problem, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA requests comments on whether, if it were to adopt a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement for automatic reactivation, it should qualify that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement further, by requiring that the air bag be reactivated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only when the restarting of the vehicle occurs after the ignition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has been off for more than some minimum period, perhaps a period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of several hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ultimate decision whether to mandate manual or automatic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactivation of the air bag will depend in large measure on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency's assessment of the relative effects of each method of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactivation on the safety of the infant and non-infant occupants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the front right passenger seating position in the vehicles affected by this rulemaking. Using data from the National

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accident Sampling System (NASS) and Fatal Accident Reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
System (FARS), the agency has attempted to quantify the potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety trade-offs in its preliminary regulatory evaluation for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this rulemaking. NHTSA seeks comments and information that would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enable the agency to refine its estimates of those trade-offs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Warning Light 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA is proposing to require a telltale light on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dashboard that is clearly visible from both the driver and front 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
passenger seating positions and that is illuminated whenever the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
passenger air bag has been deactivated by means of the cutoff 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
device. This light would be separate from the air bag readiness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicator already required by Standard No. 208. NHTSA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing that the color of the telltale be yellow, with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
words ``AIR BAG OFF'' clearly visible on the telltale when the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
passenger side air bag has been deactivated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA believes that the indicator should be visible to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
driver as a reminder that the passenger air bag is, or is not, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functioning. NHTSA believes that the indicator should be also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
visible from the passenger seating position as a warning to non-infant occupants that they are not protected by their
air bag. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the agency is requiring a warning light that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
visible to the passenger, its effectiveness may be limited by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether a passenger actually looks at, or for, the light, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
understands its message. The agency seeks comment on whether a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplemental or additional warning for passengers would minimize instances in which the air bag was unintentionally
not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactivated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA is concerned that the level of illumination should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the ambient light condition, and is therefore 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requiring that the warning light indicator provide at least two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels of brightness, one of which is barely discernible to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
driver who has adapted to dark ambient roadway conditions. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, NHTSA is specifying that the warning light indicator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall not be adjustable under any driving condition to a level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is invisible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

E. Air Bag Readiness Indicator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, S4.5.2 of FMVSS No. 208 requires that every 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle equipped with an air bag also be equipped with an air bag 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
readiness indicator that informs the driver about the operational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
status of the air bag system. Specifically, S4.5.2 states: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
An occupant protection system that deploys in the event 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a crash shall have a monitoring system with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
readiness indicator. The indicator shall monitor its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
own readiness and shall be clearly visible from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
driver's designated seating position. *&blank;*&blank;* 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA is not aware of any manufacturer which complies with this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement by installing separate readiness indicators, one for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the driver air bag and another for the passenger air bag. If a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
single readiness indicator for two air bags were used on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle with an air bag cutoff device, the indicator would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicate the non-functioning of an air bag whenever the passenger 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
air bag was deactivated. NHTSA is concerned that, under those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances, the driver would have no means of knowing the operational status of the driver air bag. NHTSA considered

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing to amend S4.5.2 to require separate readiness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicators for the driver and passenger side air bags. Instead, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA is proposing to amend S4.5.2 to limit the operation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
single readiness indicator when the cutoff device is ``on'' so that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the indicator monitors only the air bag that is not deactivated, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i.e., the driver air bag. When the cutoff device is ``off,'' the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
passenger air bag would be activated, and the readiness indicator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would monitor the readiness of both the driver air bag and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
passenger air bag. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Owner's Manual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA is also proposing to require that manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include information concerning the cutoff device in the owner's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manual. NHTSA is not proposing specific language which must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in the owner's manual. NHTSA is proposing to require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the owner's manual to include instructions on the operation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the cutoff device, a statement that the cutoff device should only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be used when a rear-facing infant restraint is installed in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
front passenger seating position, and a warning about the safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consequences of using the cutoff device at other times.

G. Labels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, Standard No. 208 requires that by September 1, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994, air bag-equipped vehicles will bear a label on the sun 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
visor that warns, in part: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Also, Standard No. 213 has been amended to require either of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following labels on rear-facing infant seats or on child 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restraints that can be converted for use in a rear-facing infant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mode:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 -->
WARNING: PLACE THIS RESTRAINT IN A VEHICLE 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SEAT THAT DOES NOT HAVE AN AIR BAG
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
or
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 -->
WARNING: WHEN YOUR BABY'S SIZE REQUIRES THAT THIS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RESTRAINT BE USED SO THAT YOUR BABY FACES 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE, PLACE THE RESTRAINT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IN A VEHICLE SEAT THAT DOES NOT HAVE AN AIR BAG
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The first warning is to be used for child seats that are rear-facing only, and the second warning is to be used for infant

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seats that convert from forward-facing to rear-facing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA has tentatively concluded that the language of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labels need not be amended. Manufacturers of child restraint 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems are required to state in the printed instructions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accompanying the restraint that the safest location for any child 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restraint is in the rear seat, regardless of whether the vehicle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has an air bag. In addition, NHTSA is concerned that changing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the language to clarify that the warning does not apply when the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
air bag can be deactivated will lessen the impact of the message 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the public. Since not all vehicles may be equipped with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cutoff devices, NHTSA is concerned that the result of lessening 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the impact of the message would be the placement of an infant in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a seating position with an air bag that cannot be deactivated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. Phase-out of Manual Cutoff Devices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has tentatively concluded that use of manual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cutoff devices should not be permitted indefinitely. The agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has also tentatively concluded that vehicles with air bags having 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manual cutoff devices should not be counted toward compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the phase-in for air bags. Further, manual cutoff devices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be prohibited in all passenger cars manufactured on or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after September 1, 1997, and all light trucks manufactured on or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after September 1, 1998. These are the dates on which 100 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent compliance is required by 49 U.S.C. 30127. To implement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these proposals, NHTSA would amend S4.1.5.1(b)'s definition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an ``inflatable restraint system,'' a term used in the paragraphs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relating to the air bag requirements, to state that it does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include an air bag that can be deactivated by a manual cutoff 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
device. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This several year period would give manufacturers time to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
develop and introduce automatic devices. Automatic technology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would reduce the potential problem with either intentional or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accidental misuse of these devices to deactivate an air bag at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
times other than when a rear-facing infant restraint is in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seat. The agency is optimistic that new automatic sensing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technology will soon be available to deactivate an air bag in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain situations, or to modify the deployment rate of the air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bag according to the speed of the impact or the distance between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the air bag and the occupant to be protected. NHTSA encourages 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle manufacturers and suppliers to continue and accelerate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their efforts to develop such technology.

VII. Automatic Cutoff Devices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed previously, NHTSA has concluded that Standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No. 208 currently allows automatic cutoff devices. NHTSA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requests comments on whether the agency should regulate automatic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cutoff devices. As part of this rulemaking proceeding, NHTSA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requests comments on whether any or all of the proposals in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice relating to warning lights, readiness indicators, owner's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manuals, and labels should also apply to vehicles equipped with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
automatic cutoff devices. NHTSA believes that the vehicle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers, in developing automatic cutoff devices, will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attempt to guard against the possibility of air bags being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
automatically deactivated when they should be providing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection. Nevertheless, for the purpose of possible future 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking, the agency requests comments on the necessity for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA's taking steps to ensure that air bag protection remains 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activated at all appropriate times. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VIII. Consumer Education 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency actively works with consumer groups to promote 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
child safety, and has been instrumental in reversing the stance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
long held by the American Academy of Pediatrics that infant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restraints may be placed in the front seat. Additional consumer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
education is a necessary ingredient toward a successful 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attainment of the philosophy embodied in this rulemaking. Toward 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that end, NHTSA will work actively with the interested parties to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further promote infant safety and to minimize any risk to infants from passenger side air bag. NHTSA invites comments
in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
important area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IX. Proposed Effective Date
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If adopted, the proposed amendments would become effective 30 days following publication of the final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
X. Rulemaking Analyses and Notices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA has considered the impact of this rulemaking action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under E.O. 12866 and the Department of Transportation's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory policies and procedures. This rulemaking document was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reviewed under E.O. 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action has been determined to be ``significant'' under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department of Transportation's regulatory policies and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Absent this rulemaking, and given a vehicle population in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which all cars and light trucks are equipped with driver and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
passenger air bags, an estimated 1,050 air bag deployments a year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will occur in pickup trucks and two-seater vehicles when a front 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
passenger seat is occupied by an infant in a rear-facing infant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seat. The level of the injuries resulting from these deployments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are uncertain, but may well be severe. In an effort to assess 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the potential for safety trade-offs resulting from the failure to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactivate the air bag after it has been deactivated for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefit of infant passengers, the agency estimated that only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about one percent of the vehicles which would be permitted to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a cutoff device are likely to be carrying an infant. If one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumes for the purpose of analysis that the older occupants of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 percent of these vehicles did not reactivate the air bag for the benefit of non-infant passengers, approximately
3 occupants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who are at least one year old may receive AIS 2&hyph;5 (survivable) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injuries. In addition, for every one percent of all affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles in which the older occupants deliberately turn off the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
air bag, 1&hyph;3 fatalities and 23&hyph;32 additional injuries could occur 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each year. Since the agency believes that the percentage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles in which the passenger air bag is inadvertently or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deliberately deactivated would be fairly small, the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
infants who would avoid potentially serious injury far exceeds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the number of non-infants who might be injured. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA estimates that the per vehicle price impact for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition of a passenger air bag cutoff device is $10.15 in 1993 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dollars. This cost reflects a cost of $5.15 for the cutoff 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
device and $5.00 for the light sensor that allows the warning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
light to have variable levels of brightness. NHTSA has not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimated the annual costs of this proposal, as that figure is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dependent on the number of vehicles voluntarily equipped with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manual cutoff devices.

B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA has also considered the impacts of this notice under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I hereby certify that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial number of small entities. As explained above, NHTSA does not anticipate a significant economic impact
from this

C. Paperwork Reduction Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (P.L. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
96&hyph;511), there are no requirements for information collection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with this proposed rule.

D. National Environmental Policy Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA has also analyzed this proposed rule under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Environmental Policy Act and determined that it would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not have a significant impact on the human environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA has analyzed this proposal in accordance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principles and criteria contained in E.O. 12612, and has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that this proposed rule would not have significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federalism Assessment.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule would not have any retroactive effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under 49 U.S.C. 30103, whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard is in effect, a State may not adopt or maintain a safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard applicable to the same aspect of performance which is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not identical to the Federal standard, except to the extent that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the state requirement imposes a higher level of performance and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applies only to vehicles procured for the State's use. 49 U.S.C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30161 sets forth a procedure for judicial review of final rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishing, amending or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards. That section does not require submission
of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before parties may file suit in court.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons are invited to submit comments on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal. It is requested but not required that 10 copies be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All comments must not exceed 15 pages in length. (49 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
553.21). Necessary attachments may be appended to these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submissions without regard to the 15-page limit. This limitation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is intended to encourage commenters to detail their primary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arguments in a concise fashion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a commenter wishes to submit certain information under a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claim of confidentiality, three copies of the complete 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submission, including purportedly confidential business 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information, should be submitted to the Chief Counsel, NHTSA, at

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corporation, and the Office of Thrift Supervision, (collectively, the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial supervisory agencies or agencies) propose to revise their regulations concerning the Community Reinvestment
Act (CRA). The agencies published a joint notice of proposed rulemaking on this issue on December 21, 1993 (December
proposal). The revised proposal published today reflects comments received on the December proposal and the agencies'
further internal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considerations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the CRA regulations is to implement the continuing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and affirmative obligation of regulated financial institutions to help meet the credit needs of their communities,
including low- and moderate-income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound operations and to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance on how the agencies assess the performance of institutions in meeting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that obligation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised proposal would provide guidance to financial institutions on the nature and extent of their CRA obligation
and the methods by which the obligation will be assessed and enforced. The proposed procedures seek to emphasize performance
rather than process, promote consistency in assessments, permit more effective enforcement against institutions
with poor performance, and reduce unnecessary compliance burden while stimulating improved performance. As compared
to the December proposal, the revised proposal broadens the examination of performance, more explicitly considers
community development activities, and makes other modifications and clarifications.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal financial supervisory agencies are jointly proposing to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revise their regulations implementing the CRA (12 U.S.C. 2901 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The proposed regulations would replace the existing regulations in their entirety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CRA is designed to promote affirmative and ongoing efforts by regulated financial institutions to help meet the
credit needs of their entire communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safe
and sound operations. Despite the CRA's notable successes, bank and thrift industry, community, consumer and other
groups maintain that its full 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential has not been realized, in large part, because compliance efforts have focused on process rather than performance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with a request by the President, the Federal financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supervisory agencies have undertaken a comprehensive effort to reform their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation standards and examination procedures. The proposed regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would implement one part of this reform effort by substituting a new system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that would rate institutions based on their actual performance in helping to meet community credit needs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to this rulemaking, the agencies will work together to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improve examiner training and to increase interagency coordination regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application of standards, performance of examinations, assignment of ratings, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and use of enforcement procedures. These efforts should produce a CRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment process that is less burdensome for many institutions yet yields 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
better results for the local communities the law is intended to benefit.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1977, the Congress enacted the CRA to encourage banks and thrifts to help meet the credit needs of low- and moderate-income
communities, consistent with safe and sound lending practices. In the CRA, the Congress found that regulated financial
institutions are required to demonstrate that their deposit facilities serve the convenience and needs of the communities
in which they are chartered to do business, and that the convenience and needs of communities include the need for credit
as well as deposit services. The CRA has come to play an increasingly important role in improving access to credit among
under-served communities_both rural and urban_across the country. Under the impetus of the CRA, many banks and thrifts
opened new branches, provided expanded services, and made substantial commitments to increase lending to all segments
of society. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Despite these successes, the CRA examination and enforcement system has been criticized. Financial institutions
have complained that policy guidance from the supervisory agencies on the CRA is unclear and that examination standards
are applied inconsistently. Financial institutions have also complained that the CRA examination process encourages
them to generate excessive paperwork at the expense of providing loans, services, and investments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Community, consumer, and other groups have agreed with the industry that there are inconsistencies in CRA evaluations
and current examinations overemphasize process and underemphasize performance. Community and consumer groups
also have criticized the regulatory agencies for failing to aggressively penalize banks and thrifts for poor performance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Believing that the CRA examination and enforcement process can be improved, the President requested in July 1993
that the Federal financial supervisory agencies reform the CRA examination and enforcement system. The President
asked the agencies to consult with the banking and thrift industries, Congressional leaders, and leaders of community-based
organizations across the country to develop new CRA regulations and examination procedures that ``replace paperwork
and uncertainty with greater performance, clarity, and objectivity.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the President asked the agencies to refocus the CRA examination system on more objective, performance-based
assessment standards that minimize compliance burden while stimulating improved performance. He also asked the
agencies to develop a well-trained corps of examiners who would specialize in CRA examinations. In undertaking this
effort, the President requested that the agencies promote consistency and even-handedness, improve CRA performance
evaluations, and institute more effective sanctions against institutions with consistently poor performance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To implement the President's initiative, the four agencies held a series of seven public hearings across the country
in 1993. At those hearings, the agencies heard from over 250 witnesses. Nearly 50 others submitted written statements.
The preamble to the December proposal reviewed the results of those hearings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
The December Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The December proposal (58 FR 67466) would have eliminated the twelve assessment factors in the present CRA regulation
and substituted a performance-based evaluation system. Under the December proposal, a financial institution would
not have been assessed on its efforts to meet community credit needs, nor on its methods for determining the credit
needs of its community. Rather, the agencies would have evaluated institutions based on their actual lending, service,
and investment performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generally, independent institutions with at least $250 million in assets and affiliates of holding companies with
at least $250 million in bank and thrift assets would have been evaluated based on some combination of lending, service,
and investment tests. Institutions would have had to report to the agencies and make available to the public data on
the geographic distribution of their loan applications, denials, originations and purchases. Small banks and thrifts
could have elected to be evaluated under a streamlined method that would not have required them to report this data.
Every institution would have had the option to have its performance evaluated based on a pre-approved strategic plan
that had been subjected to review and comment by community-based organizations and the rest of the public. However,
the strategic plan option would not have relieved an institution of its data reporting obligations.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There would have been five ratings_``outstanding,'' ``high satisfactory,'' ``low satisfactory,'' ``needs to
improve,'' and ``substantial noncompliance''_under each of the lending, investment, and service tests so as to
measure with more refinement the variations in performance among institutions. The agencies proposed to have only
four overall ratings, however, as required by statute_``outstanding,'' ``satisfactory,'' ``needs to improve,''
and ``substantial noncompliance.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The December proposal was originally published with a 60-day comment period. This period was extended for 30 additional
days in view of the magnitude of the proposed changes, the complexity of the issues, the level of interest in the subject,
and delays resulting from the holiday season (59 FR 5138). After considering the thousands of comments received,
the agencies produced the revised regulations proposed today, which respond to suggestions in the comments while
preserving the December proposal's goal of emphasizing performance over process.

The agencies reviewed and considered all of the above-described comments concerning the December proposal. Comments
are discussed in greater detail in the section-by-section analysis of the revised proposal. As a general matter,
the vast majority of commenters expressed support for the agencies' goal of developing more objective, performance-based
assessment standards that minimize burden while stimulating improved performance. Many commenters believed that,
under the existing CRA regulations, the agencies focus too closely on documentation of CRA performance and too little
on actual performance. These commenters felt the present documentation requirements are overly burdensome. Many
commenters also supported the agencies' goal of ensuring consistency and evenhandedness among the agencies in CRA
evaluations. Commenters supported enhanced CRA examiner training to increase consistency. While most commenters
generally supported the agencies' goals in amending their CRA regulations, many expressed concern over some aspects
of the December proposal.

The Revised Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 -->
In General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The revised proposal retains, to a significant extent, the principles and structure underlying the December proposal
but makes significant changes to the details in order to respond to many of the concerns raised in the comments. Like
the December proposal, the revised proposal would eliminate the existing regulation's twelve assessment factors
and substitute a performance-based evaluation system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to take into account community characteristics and needs, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the revised proposal would make explicit the assessment context against which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the tests and standards set out in the proposed regulation would be applied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This assessment context would include consideration of: (1) Demographic data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about the community; (2) information about community characteristics and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needs; (3) information about the institution's capacity and constraints; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) information about the institution's product offerings and business strategy; (5) data on the prior performance
of the institution; and (6) data on the performance of similarly-situated lenders. The agencies, rather than the
institution, would develop the assessment context for each institution. The agencies will neither require nor request
an institution to provide data for this assessment context, although any data offered by an institution would be considered.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As in the December proposal, the agencies would give particular attention to the institution's record of helping
to meet credit needs in low- and moderate-income geographies. However, the revised proposal would further emphasize
the institution's performance with respect to low- and moderate- income individuals, and other individuals and
areas where appropriate, given community characteristics and needs. The agencies also have modified the definitions
of low- and moderate-income geographies in response to concerns that the definitions in the December proposal were
too low for high cost areas. Under the revised proposal, the qualifying income levels would be adjusted to reflect
prevailing housing construction costs or significant anomalies in family income levels. The agencies would make
available annually a list of qualifying income levels by geographic area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The lending, service and investment tests would continue to constitute the primary method by which the agencies would
assess the CRA performance of independent retail institutions with at least $250 million in assets and affiliates
of holding companies with at least $250 million in bank and thrift assets. However, the revised proposal changes how
an institution's ratings on the three tests would be combined to produce the institution's overall composite rating.
The revised proposal would give primacy to lending performance by requiring an institution to receive a ``satisfactory''
or better rating on the lending test in order to receive a ``satisfactory'', or better, overall rating. At the same
time, the rating system would increase the importance of the service and investment tests, because the effect of those
tests on the overall rating would no longer be limited to situations in which an institution had extraordinarily strong
or weak performance on one of the tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies also have made modifications to the details of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lending, service and investment tests in order to broaden their scope. Rather 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than rely presumptively on a few quantitative measures that could then be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjusted or rebutted by other considerations, the tests would be based from the outset on a broader range of quantitative
and qualitative criteria that would include both those criteria that formed the basis for the presumptive ratings
in the December proposal and those additional considerations contained in the adjustment and rebuttal sections
of the December proposal. The revised proposal therefore would not use rebuttable presumptions and adjustments.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These revisions to the lending, investment and service tests would increase, rather than reduce, the number of judgments
that examiners would be required to make in the examination process. The agencies believe that a CRA evaluation system
eliminating all examiner judgment would not be desirable, even if it were achievable. Preservation of examiner judgment
to take into account the characteristics and needs of an institution's community and the capacity and constraints
of the institution is critical.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
At the same time, the agencies believe that consistency in evaluations, reduction in compliance burden, and focus
on performance are fully consistent with the necessary degree of examiner judgment. The agencies believe that the
revised proposal, which entails a series of examiner decisions in reliance on detailed data concerning an institution's
actual lending, service and investment performance, would provide the proper balance between objective analysis
and subjective judgment. In order to minimize unnecessary subjectivity, the agencies have attempted to provide
more guidance in the revised proposal as to the standards that examiners would apply to make the required judgments.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to identifying the data that would form the basis for their performance analysis, the information that
would provide the background assessment context, and the criteria that would guide the assessments, the agencies
have proposed detailed performance rating profiles for each rating level of the lending, service, and investment
tests. An institution's performance need not fit every performance aspect of the typical profile in order to receive
a certain rating. Exceptionally strong performance on some aspects can compensate for weak performance on others.
However, the institution would receive a rating which is generally consistent with the institution's overall performance
on the various aspects of the profile. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The December proposal based its presumptive ratings on comparative terms, for example whether an institution's
qualified investments were significant as compared to its capital, or whether an insignificant percentage of an
institution's branches were located in or readily accessible to low- and moderate-income geographies in the institution's
service area. While many comments stated that these terms should be further defined, few 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters, despite a specific request in the December proposal, actually suggested what these definitions should
be. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ratings profiles in the current proposal continue to use comparative terms, such as excellent, significant,
and poor, without further specification. Many comments agreed that the mechanical application of numerical ratios
would not foster fair and appropriate CRA assessments. The agencies continue to believe, given the wide diversity
of institutions and communities, that it is inadvisable to provide such specific numerical ranges or ratios. The
agencies expect the current proposal to increase the consistency and clarity of the examination process. By identifying
a set of performance-based assessment criteria, and expanding the objective performance data available to examinations,
institutions and the public will be better able to evaluate the basis on which examiner judgments are made. In addition,
by providing more detailed profiles that involve several criteria, assessment under the current proposal will not
turn on the evaluation of a single factor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised proposal also modifies the lending and service tests for retail institutions to emphasize the importance
of community development activities in the assessments of performance under those tests. In addition, the revised
proposal replaces the investment test with a community development test for wholesale or limited purpose institutions.
The proposal incorporates into this community development test both community development lending and community
development services in addition to qualified investments. Therefore, under the revised proposal, wholesale or
limited purpose institutions would be subject only to the community development test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised proposal would reduce data reporting burdens by streamlining reporting requirements to coincide more
closely with existing requirements and eliminating unnecessary reporting. The one significant new data reporting
requirement would be that small business and small farm loan data reported to the agencies would include information
on the race and gender of small business and farm borrowers to respond to concerns that the December proposal did not
give enough weight to the fair lending aspect of an institution's CRA performance. This concern is also reflected
in the revision of the provisions regarding consideration of illegal discrimination to conform them more closely
to existing regulatory language.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Smaller banks and thrifts would continue to be evaluated under a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
streamlined assessment method that would not require reporting of additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lending data. However, the streamlined method would be the presumptive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method for evaluating small institutions and would be applied to every 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualifying institution unless the institution affirmatively requests an alternative assessment method. The agencies
have also altered the description of the streamlined assessment method in order to make clear that this assessment
is not intended to operate as an exemption from the CRA rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The streamlined assessment method would continue to focus on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's loan-to-deposit ratio, degree of local lending, record of lending to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrowers and geographies of different income levels, and record of responding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to complaints. The institution's fair lending record would still be taken into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
account in assigning a final rating. In response to comments, the agencies have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eliminated the provision in the December proposal that made a loan-to-deposit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ratio of 60% or more presumptively satisfactory. The revised proposal would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider an institution's size, financial condition, and credit needs of its service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area in evaluating whether its loan-to-deposit ratio is reasonable. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation would further consider, as appropriate, other lending-related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities, such as originations for sale on the secondary market and community 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development lending and investment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Every institution would continue to have the option to be evaluated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursuant to a pre-approved strategic plan. The strategic plan option would not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relieve an institution from any reporting obligations that it otherwise would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have. The revised proposal clarifies, however, that small institutions would not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject themselves to any data reporting responsibilities by electing the strategic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan option. The agencies also have provided more detail as to how the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed strategic plan option would operate in practice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised proposal has eliminated provisions that some comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interpreted as ``safe harbors'' from examination or enforcement action. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised proposal would not make substantive modifications to the December 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions governing what types of institutions are subject to the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, although the agencies have clarified that bankers banks would not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be covered. The revised proposal continues to provide that uninsured branches 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of foreign banks would not be covered by the proposed regulations. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the agencies are aware that the Interstate Banking Efficiency Act would address 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the CRA coverage of certain uninsured branches of foreign banks. Should this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act be signed into law, the agencies would modify the revised proposal to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflect the new legal requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The December proposal would have made an institution with an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assigned rating of ``substantial noncompliance'' subject to an enforcement action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under 12 U.S.C. 1818. A number of commenters questioned the legal authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the agencies under the CRA to use assigned ratings as the basis for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcement action. Other commenters endorsed taking enforcement action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against institutions with poor CRA ratings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised proposal includes the enforcement provisions from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
December proposal while the agencies continue to analyze the issues raised by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the comments. The agencies invite further comment on these issues before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issuing a final rule.

The Lending Test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The lending test in the December proposal would have evaluated_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the basis of its performance in relation to other lenders subject to CRA and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on an independent basis_the extent to which a retail institution was making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loans in the low- and moderate-income portions of its service area. The test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would have evaluated an institution's lending performance relative to other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lenders by comparing the institution's market share of housing, small business, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small farm, and consumer loans in the low- and moderate-income geographies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of its service area with its share of such loans in the other parts of its service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area. The test would have evaluated performance on an independent basis by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examining the ratio of reported loans made (both number and amount) by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution in the low- and moderate-income geographies of its service area to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the reported loans made throughout its entire service area and the geographic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of its reported loans across the low- and moderate-income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
geographies of its service area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the election of the institution, the agencies would have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered indirect loans under the lending test. Indirect loans were defined to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include loans made by third parties, such as lending consortia, subsidiaries of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution, non-chartered affiliates funded by the institution, and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lenders that lent to low- and moderate-income individuals or geographies and in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the institution had made lawful investments. The agencies would have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attributed indirect loans to an institution in proportion to the size of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's investment in or funding of the third party lender or participation in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the third party's loans, provided the institution reported the indirect loans.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The December proposal would have made a distinction between the ability of an institution to claim credit under the
lending test for indirect loans by its subsidiaries and funded non-chartered affiliates and its ability to claim
credit for indirect loans made by other lenders. An institution would have been able to claim credit for lending by
its subsidiaries or non-chartered affiliates if the institution either invested in the entity or made a loan to it.
For third party lenders, however, the institution would have been required to make an investment in the entity (as
opposed to making a loan to the entity) in order to claim credit under the lending test for the third party loans. The
purpose of this distinction was to recognize the unique relationship between an institution and its subsidiaries
and affiliates, and to give institutions and their parent corporations greater flexibility to structure their lending
as they saw fit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the foregoing factors would have served as the basis for a rating under the lending test, the December proposal
would have allowed the agencies to adjust an institution's assessment upward, and, in exceptional cases, downward.
Upward adjustment might have been warranted if the institution made, for example, a substantial amount of loans requiring
innovative underwriting or loans for which there was special need, such as loans for multifamily housing construction
and rehabilitation, loans for start-up or very small businesses, loans to community development organizations
or facilities, or loans to very low-income individuals and geographies. An institution's assessment also could
have been increased if it operated a ``second look'' program to reevaluate loan applications that, based on an initial
review, the institution had planned to deny. On the other hand, a downward adjustment could have been warranted if,
for example, the quantitative measures inaccurately portrayed the institution's actual lending to low- or moderate-income
geographies or individuals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters from both the banking industry and the public believed the lending test contained in the December proposal
was too narrow in its focus. In particular, some believed the test gave insufficient emphasis to community development
lending and innovative underwriting. Other commenters noted that the proposed lending test placed undue emphasis
on the location of the borrower rather than on the borrower's individual characteristics (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 income). Some commenters believed the December proposal would have given institutions a greater incentive to make
loans to high-income borrowers located in low-income geographies than to make loans to low-income borrowers located
in high-income geographies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to commenters who believed the December proposal underemphasized the importance of community development
lending, the revised proposal would treat such lending as a principal component of an institution's lending performance,
not merely an adjustment factor. The revised proposal also defines community development loans. Such loans are loans
(including lines of credit, commitments and letters of credit) that address affordable housing or other community
economic development needs not being met by the private market, provided such loans (1) Principally benefit low-
or moderate-income individuals, businesses or small farms with annual revenues less than or equal to $1 million,
or businesses or farms that qualify as small businesses under a Small Business Administration program; (2) have not
been reported or collected by the bank or one of its affiliates as home mortgage loans, small business loans, small
farm loans, or consumer loans for CRA purposes, unless the loans are for multifamily dwellings (as defined in the Home
Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) (12 U.S.C. 2801 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) regulations); and (3) except in the case of a wholesale or limited purpose bank, benefit the bank's service area(s)
or a broader statewide or regional area that includes the bank's service area(s). This definition clarifies that
community development loans deserving of favorable consideration are those that fill a void left by the ordinary
operation of the private market. In addition, it is designed to prevent double-counting of all loans except for multifamily
housing loans, which the agencies believe should be considered both in the distribution analyses of an institution's
home mortgage lending and for evaluation of its community development lending in order to properly evaluate the value
of the loans for CRA purposes. Finally, the definition also provides that an institution will get favorable consideration
for a community development loan if it is in the institution's service area or is in a broader region that includes the
institution's service area. This broader geographic scope would recognize the nature of some lending programs and
consortia that produce these loans. An institution would be evaluated based on the number, amount, complexity, and
innovativeness of its community development loans.

Examples of community development loans identified by the agencies include, but are not limited to, loans to: borrowers

of multifamily rental property serving low- and moderate-income persons; not-for-profit organizations serving
primarily low- and moderate-income housing or other community economic development needs; borrowers in support

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies also have revised the lending test in response to comments that the December proposal placed undue emphasis
on the geography of the borrower rather than on the borrower's individual characteristics. Under the revised proposal,
while the agencies would continue to place a heavy emphasis on the geographic distribution of an institution's lending,
they also would consider favorably loans made to low- and moderate-income individuals regardless of where the borrowers
reside. The agencies would evaluate the number and amount of home mortgage loans to low-, moderate-, middle-, and
upper-income individuals; the number and amount of loans to small business and small farms with annual revenues less
than or equal to $1 million; the number and amount of loans to small businesses and small farms by size of loan; and, at
the institution's option, the number and amount of consumer loans to low-, moderate-, middle-, and upper-income
individuals. The revised proposal provides that distribution of borrower characteristics would be examined with
particular reference to the institution's service area, but need not be limited to the institution's service area.
Institutions would receive favorable consideration for lending to low- and moderate-income individuals and small
businesses and farms outside of their service area, so long as they have not neglected these borrowers inside their
service area. The agencies have also created an assessment criterion regarding an institution's use of innovative
and flexible lending practices to recognize those programs and products that might have been cause for upward adjustments
in the December proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies received numerous comments on the market share component of the lending test. Many banks and thrifts
felt the market share test was misleading in that, among other things, it overlooked loans by institutions that do
not have any reporting obligations under HMDA or CRA. Further, institutions could have had service areas that overlapped
partially, but not completely, in ways that would distort the measurement of their lending performance under the
test. Many also were concerned that if one bank increased its market share, another necessarily would lose market
share; hence, the commenters suggested that the market share test could promote a price war among institutions trying
to make loans in low- and moderate-income areas, potentially leading to unsafe and unsound banking practices. Banks
and thrifts frequently stated that the lending test in the December proposal was a form of credit allocation. On the
other hand, many community groups and government officials liked the market share test because it provided an objective
and quantitative standard for measuring an institution's CRA performance. At the same time, a number of community
groups expressed concern that the formula did not take into account qualitative differences among loans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of these comments, the lending test has been modified. The lending test would continue to give significant
weight to the geographic distribution of an institution's lending; and, as part of the assessment context, examiners
would consider, among other considerations described earlier in this preamble, the performance of other similarly-situated
lenders where appropriate. In this regard, examiners would use market share and other analyses to assist in evaluating
the geographic distribution of an institution's lending where such analyses would provide accurate insight. However,
the proposed regulation does not require examiners to use any single type of analysis, and would not link a particular
market share ratio, or any ratio, with a particular lending test rating. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In considering the geographic distribution of an institution's loans, the agencies, under the revised proposal,
would evaluate the number and amount of an institution's loans in the low-, moderate-, middle-, and upper-income
geographies of the institution's service area. They also would assess the dispersion of the institution's lending
throughout its service area. In response to concerns expressed by some commenters that an institution might limit
the size of its service area to obtain a better performance rating, the revised proposal would penalize an institution
if too little of its lending were made inside its service area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While agreeing with the concept of including affiliate and third-party lending at the institution's option, many
industry commenters criticized the December proposal_which would not have considered lending by chartered or non-funded
affiliates_as unduly restrictive and inconsistent with the corporate funding practices of certain institutions.
Also, some community and consumer groups expressed concern that institutions could use third-party lending to avoid
their direct lending obligations and, in effect, ``buy out'' of their CRA obligations.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Like the December proposal, the revised proposal would allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions, at their option, to include affiliate and third-party lending in their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lending record but would make certain changes to the December proposal in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this regard. First, the revised proposal would consider indirect lending by any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of an institution's affiliates_regardless of whether the affiliate is chartered or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
how it is funded. The revised proposal would not impose restrictions on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corporate structures of institutions and their affiliates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the rules regarding the allocation of loans among affiliates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been simplified. The revised proposal would also include several new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions designed to prevent an institution from selectively including (or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excluding) its affiliate lending. Under the revised proposal, the agencies would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluate an institution's affiliate lending when assessing the institution's overall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lending performance, provided the institution (or its affiliate) chooses to collect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and report the data pertaining to such lending. If an institution chooses to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report some of its affiliate loans in a service area for a particular lending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
category, such as home mortgages, or small business loans, it would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to report all of its affiliate loans of that category for that specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service area. An agency would be able to consider the lending of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's affiliate, notwithstanding whether the institution wants the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to consider its affiliate lending, if the agency were to determine that such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lending is integral to the institution's business. An affiliate's lending would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
integral to an institution's business if the institution's operations closely involve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or support the marketing, management, or other operation of the affiliate's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lending. Lending would not be considered integral to an institution's business 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
merely because the institution had a financial interest in the affiliate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, the revised proposal would no longer allow an institution to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include third party loans with its direct and affiliate loans for purposes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessing the geographic distribution of the institution's lending or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of its lending across borrower characteristics. Under the revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal, third party loans could be attributed to an institution only if they meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the definition of community development loans. This change responds to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments from community and consumer groups who expressed concern that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions could use third-party lending to avoid their direct lending obligations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and, in effect, ``buy out'' of their CRA obligations. The revised proposal also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would operate to relieve third party lenders of the burden of reporting the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
geographic location of their loans that could have been placed on them by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
December proposal.

The Investment Test

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the December proposal, retail institutions as well as wholesale or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited purpose institutions would have been evaluated under the investment test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on the amount of assets they had devoted to ``qualified investments'' in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comparison to their risk-based capital. The focus of the investment test would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been on the ultimate impact of an institution's investment rather than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investment per se. Therefore, qualified investments would not have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credited under the test unless they had a demonstrable impact, e.g., in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing loans or community development projects that benefit low- and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moderate-income individuals and geographies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Qualified investments would have included lawful investments that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefit low- and moderate-income geographies or individuals in an institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service area. Examples of such investments would have included those: (1) in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
support of local affordable housing and community, economic, or small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business development; (2) in community development financial institutions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community development corporations, community development projects, small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business investment companies (including specialized small business investment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
companies), and minority- and women-owned financial institutions and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community development financial intermediaries; (3) in consortia or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities serving low- and moderate-income individuals and areas; and (4) in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
state and local government agency housing bonds or state and local government 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revenue bonds specifically aimed at helping low- and moderate-income areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and individuals. Eligible grants and the donation or sale on favorable terms of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
branches to minority- or women-owned financial institutions also would have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
counted as qualifying investments.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies could have adjusted an institution's rating upward 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the investment test to take into account whether the institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investments were particularly innovative or met a special need or whether the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's activities in connection with the investments were particularly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complex or intensive. The agencies also would have been able to adjust an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's rating upward if the institution had made a large amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investments that would have been qualified investments except that they failed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to benefit the institution's service area. Downward adjustments would have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been justified only in exceptional cases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters criticized several aspects of the proposal. Most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notably, many banking industry commenters expressed dissatisfaction with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test's focus on the amount of qualified investments relative to an institution's risk-based capital. They felt reliance
on any such investment-to-capital ratio would unfairly penalize well-capitalized institutions. Community groups
commented on various aspects of how the term ``qualified investments'' was defined and the banking industry criticized
the restriction that qualified investments must benefit the institution's service area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The investment test in the revised proposal has been modified to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
address the principal concerns raised in the comments. The reliance on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ratio of qualified investments to risk-based capital has been eliminated. Rather, under the revised proposal, the
agencies would focus on the dollar amount of the institution's qualified investments (independent of the institution's
capital), the innovativeness and complexity of the qualified investments and their connection to credit needs,
and the institution's responsiveness to credit and community economic development needs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the revised proposal clarifies the definition of ``qualified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investments.''
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 Qualified investments are lawful investments, deposits, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
membership shares in a credit union, and grants that primarily benefit low- or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moderate-income individuals or businesses or farms with under $1 million in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annual revenues or that qualify as small businesses under SBA regulations; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that address affordable housing (including multifamily rental housing) or other community economic development
needs that are not being met in the normal course of business by the private market. The agencies intend the limitation
regarding needs not being met by the private market to exclude untargeted municipal bonds and standard mortgage-backed
securities. The revised proposal also would clarify that grants, membership shares in a credit union, and other non-loan
financial support can qualify as qualified investments. Under the definition, a qualified investment would not
otherwise be disqualified because an institution receives favorable treatment (for example as a tax deduction or
credit) for them under the Internal Revenue Code. In addition, under the revised proposal, qualified investments
no longer would need to benefit an institution's service area, provided the investments benefit a broader statewide
or regional geographic area that includes the institution's service area. This change would conform with the broader
geographic scope permitted for community development loans discussed previously.

Examples of qualified investments identified by the agencies include, but are not limited to, investments and grants:
in or to financial intermediaries (including, but not limited to CDFIs, CDCs, minority- and women-owned financial
institutions, and low-income or community development credit unions) that primarily lend or facilitate lending
in low- and moderate-income areas or to low- and moderate-income individuals in order to promote affordable housing
and/or community economic development; in support of organizations engaged in affordable housing rehabilitation
and construction, including multifamily rental housing; in support of organizations promoting small businesses,
including Small Business Investment Companies (SBICs), and specialized SBICs; in and to not-for-profit organizations
serving low- and moderate-income housing needs and/or other community economic development needs; to support or
develop facilities that promote community economic development in low- and moderate-income areas or for low- and
moderate-income individuals, such as day care facilities, in projects eligible for low-income housing tax credits;
in state and municipal obligations that specifically support affordable housing or other community economic development
to benefit low- and moderate-income individuals or areas; to not-for-profit organizations serving low- and moderate-income
housing and/or other community economic development needs, such as home-ownership counseling, home maintenance
counseling, credit counseling, and other financial services education; and in or to organizations supporting activities
essential to the capacity of low- and moderate-income individuals or geographies to utilize credit or to sustain
economic development.

The revised proposal deletes the definition of small business from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the December proposal that some commenters criticized as too complicated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Instead, the qualified investment and community development loan definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refer to investments and loans that benefit businesses with annual revenues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under $1 million or that would qualify as small businesses under a Small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Business Administration program. The $1 million figure was chosen because it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is used in Regulation B to differentiate among borrowers for requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerning adverse action notices and application retention. The new proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definitions also maintain a treatment of small business that conforms to the SBA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definitions, as required by law for federal agencies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As described more fully later in this preamble, under the revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal, wholesale or limited purpose banks would be subject to evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the new community development test rather than under the investment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service Test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The December proposal would have evaluated an institution's CRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service performance primarily on the basis of the percentage of its branches 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
located in or readily accessible to low- and moderate-income geographies. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage of branches that an institution would have been expected to have in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or readily accessible to low-and moderate-income geographies in each service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area would have depended, in part, on the number of such geographies in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service area. Under the December proposal, institutions would not have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to expand the size of their branching network or to operate branches at a loss. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies would have been able to adjust an institution's service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
record upward or downward to reflect more accurately its branch service to lowor moderate-income geographies or
individuals, but downward adjustments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would have been made only in exceptional cases. In determining the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriateness and degree of any adjustment, the agencies would have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered: (1) the institution's record of opening and closing branches; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) whether branches_wherever located_were actually serving low- and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moderate-income individuals; (3) any significant differences in the quality, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantity or types of services offered to low- or moderate-income individuals or geographies; and (4) similar factors.
The agencies also could have adjusted an institution's rating upward to reflect a strong record of providing or supporting
other services that promote credit availability for low- and moderate-income individuals or geographies. Particular
weight would have been given to credit and home-ownership counseling, small and minority-owned business counseling,
low-cost check-cashing, and low-cost deposit services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The service test contained in the revised proposal would change the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service test contained in the December proposal in response to comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received by the agencies. In crafting the December proposal, the agencies were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guided by a belief that ready access to branches is a critical factor in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
availability of credit and deposit services in a community. However, many 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
banking industry representatives commented that the service test placed too 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
much emphasis on ``brick and mortar'' branches (i.e., permanent staffed banking facilities). The commenters noted
that although branches are still valuable, present technology has made the need for branches less imperative to the
provision of banking services. On the other hand, many consumer groups 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stressed that, despite changes in technology, brick and mortar branches continue to have symbolic and practical
relevance to credit availability. A number of commenters emphasized, however, that evaluations based on the mere
presence of brick and mortar facilities is not sufficient. Rather, the agencies must consider the actual services
that are provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of these comments, the agencies have decided to modify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the service test so that ``brick and mortar'' branches no longer would serve as the overwhelming factor in assessing
an institution's service performance, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
although they still would receive prominent consideration. Under the revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal, equal weight would be given to the actual services provided to low- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and moderate-income geographies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the revised proposal, the agencies would evaluate an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's systems for delivering retail banking services (where the term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``systems'' includes, among other things, branches, automated teller machines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ATMs), loan production offices, banking by telephone or computer, mobile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
branches, and bank-at-work or by-mail programs) by: (1) assessing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of the institution's branches and ATMs among low-, moderate-, middle-, and upper-income geographies;
(2) reviewing the institution's record of opening and closing branches and ATMs; (3) assessing the range of services

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided in low-, moderate-, middle-, and upper-income geographies; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) evaluating the availability of alternative systems for delivering retail banking services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the agencies would evaluate the extent to which an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution provides community development services and the innovativeness and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsiveness of such services, given the needs of the institution's community and the capacity and constraints
of the institution. The revised proposal defines community development services as services that primarily benefit
low- and moderate-income individuals, businesses or farms with annual revenues less than or equal to $1 million,
or businesses or farms that qualify as small businesses under a Small Business Administration program and that address
affordable housing (including multifamily rental housing) or other community economic development needs that
are not being met by the private market.

Examples of community development services would include, among other things: providing technical expertise for
not-for-profit organizations serving low- and moderate-income housing needs and/or economic growth and development,
lending executives to organizations facilitating affordable housing construction and rehabilitation and/or
development of affordable housing; providing credit counseling, home buyers counseling, home maintenance counseling,
and/or financial planning to promote community economic development and affordable housing, school savings programs,
and other financial services education; and offering lifeline deposit services, low-cost or free government check
cashing, or participating in an electronic benefit transfer network.

The Community Development Test for Wholesale or Limited Purpose Institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the December proposal, wholesale or limited purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions were defined as insured depository institutions that are in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business of extending credit to the public but do not make a significant amount of reportable loans (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
home mortgage, consumer, small farm and small business loans). These would have included institutions that make
primarily large commercial loans, as well as credit card banks, and similar institutions. The December proposal
would have required an evaluation of the CRA performance of these institutions primarily under the proposed investment
test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Performance under that test would have been measured based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the amount of an institution's assets devoted to qualified investments as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compared to its risk-based capital. Qualified investments would have consisted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of lawful investments that benefited low- and moderate-income geographies or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals in an institution's service area, including investments that supported local affordable housing and
community, economic, or small business 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development. Eligible grants and loans that would have constituted a qualified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investment also would have been included within the investment test. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assigning the overall rating for wholesale or limited purpose institutions, the institution's investment test
rating could have been increased one level for outstanding performance and decreased one level for a ``substantial

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance'' rating on the service test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the comments received, the revised proposal would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replace the investment test with the community development test as the primary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test for wholesale or limited purpose institutions. A number of commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered the investment test too narrowly focused to use as a tool for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessing the CRA performance of wholesale or limited purpose institutions and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested replacing the test with a test that focused on community development 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities more generally. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The community development test in the revised proposal would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
focus on a wholesale or limited purpose institution's record in helping to meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the credit needs of its service area through qualified investments, community 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development lending, and community development services. In general, these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community development-related activities would be similar to the community 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development aspects of the lending and service tests, and would adopt the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of qualified investments used in the investment test in the revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal. The community development test also would consider small business 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and small farm loans as well as loans to low- and moderate-income individuals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and geographies as community development loans, whether or not reported or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collected under the data collection requirements of the revised proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters believed the December proposal's definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of wholesale or limited purpose institutions did not clearly distinguish between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these types of institutions and retail institutions. Some commenters also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested that these institutions be permitted to conduct a certain amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incidental retail lending without losing their wholesale or limited purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution status. Several comments suggested that an institution should have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the opportunity to confirm its status as a wholesale or limited purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution with the agencies in advance of being examined.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to these comments, the revised proposal would clarify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which institutions would be considered wholesale or limited purpose institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for purposes of CRA. The definition for institutions eligible for wholesale or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited purpose designation would be as follows: (1) wholesale institutions are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions that are not in the business of extending home mortgage, small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business, small farm, or consumer loans to retail customers; and (2) limited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose institutions are institutions that offer only a narrow product line (such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as credit cards or automobile loans) to a national or regional market. An 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution would not be considered in the business of extending loans to retail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
customers if it does not hold itself out to the retail public as providing such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loans and the institution's revenues from extending such loans are insignificant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when compared to its overall lending operations. An institution could conduct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some incidental retail lending if the retail activity would not cause the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution to exceed these limitations. However, a so-called ``niche institution'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(an institution that is in the business of lending to the public but which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specializes in certain types of retail loans or extending credit to a class of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrowers with, for example, certain financial or professional characteristics) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not generally qualify as a wholesale or limited purpose institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised proposal also would require an institution that elects to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be evaluated as a wholesale or limited purpose institution to file a written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request with the appropriate agency and receive confirmation of its status before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the commencement of the examination. The agencies will issue guidelines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding how long in advance of a scheduled examination an institution must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
file its request, and under what circumstances an institution will have to reapply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to retain wholesale or limited purpose status. An institution whose request for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wholesale or limited purpose status has been denied by the appropriate agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be evaluated under the tests applicable to retail institutions, small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions, or an institution with approved strategic plans, as appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS did not include provisions for wholesale or limited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose thrifts in its version of the December proposal. In response to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments, the OTS's revised proposal includes provisions that would allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thrifts the opportunity to request designation as a wholesale or limited purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution.

Small Institution Assessment Option 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The December proposal would have offered small banks and thrifts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the option of choosing to be evaluated under a streamlined assessment method. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations would not have imposed upon small institutions the data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collection requirements imposed on other institutions. The agencies stressed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the preamble to the December proposal that, notwithstanding the different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment methods, examinations of small banks and thrifts would have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meaningful examinations and would not have been implemented as de facto 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exemptions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Small banks and thrifts were defined in the December proposal as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
independent institutions with assets of less than $250 million or members of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
holding companies the total banking and thrift assets of which are less than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$250 million. A small institution's CRA rating under the December proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would have been based primarily on its lending record. An institution would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been presumed to receive a ``satisfactory'' rating if it had a reasonable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loan-to-deposit ratio, made the majority of its loans locally, had a good loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mix (i.e., made a variety of loans to the extent permitted by law and regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and lent across economic levels), had no legitimate, bona-fide complaints from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community members, had not committed an isolated act of illegal discrimination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of which it had knowledge that it had not corrected fully or was not in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process of correcting fully, and had not engaged in a pattern or practice of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
illegal discrimination that it had not corrected fully. If an institution was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to report loans under the HMDA, the institution also would have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to have a reasonable geographic distribution of reported loans.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A small institution that met each of the standards for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``satisfactory'' rating and exceeded some or all of those standards could have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received an overall rating of ``outstanding'' depending on the degree to which it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeded the criteria for a ``satisfactory'' rating and, at its option, its record of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
making qualified investments and its record of providing services. If a small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution failed to meet or exceed all of the standards for a ``satisfactory'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rating, the relevant agency would have conducted a more extensive examination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the institution, including, at the option of the institution, an examination of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its investment and service performance. Also, if a small institution operated in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more than one service area, the relevant agency would have evaluated the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's performance in all of those service areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many community and consumer group commenters asked the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies to eliminate the small institution assessment method because they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believed that it would operate as an exemption for qualifying institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, many banks and thrifts, as well as the weight of Congressional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments, supported the streamlined approach. The agencies have retained the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
streamlined assessment method as modified in the revised proposal. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies also have retained the December proposal's exemption of small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions from the new data collection and reporting requirements for small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business, small farm and community development loans, although the agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have clarified that small institutions would not be subjected to those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements because they request to be evaluated under the strategic plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment option. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies reiterate, however, that they do not intend by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal to exempt small institutions from the CRA or subject them to a less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demanding standard of performance. The revised proposal has been redrafted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
so that the format of the small institution approach is more straightforward. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised proposal first states the criteria that the agencies would use to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assess the performance of a small institution, and then describes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance levels that correspond to satisfactory performance. As under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tests for large retail institutions, the agencies have eliminated the structure of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rebuttable presumptions and have proposed a rating profile. A small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's performance need not fit every aspect of the rating profile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
describing ``satisfactory'' performance for it to receive that rating. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exceptionally strong performance on some aspects can compensate for weak 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance on others provided the institution's overall performance is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the rating profile. Small institutions that do not meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards for a ``satisfactory'' record would be given the appropriate rating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without the necessity of a ``closer review.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters expressed concern that under the December 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal an institution would be required to affirmatively elect to be examined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the streamlined assessment method and suggested that the streamlined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method be the default examination procedure unless a qualifying institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elects another assessment method. The agencies agree and have drafted the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised proposal accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters representing holding companies and small institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are affiliates of holding companies with total banking and thrift assets over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$250 million urged that the $250 million asset limit take into consideration only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the assets of the subject bank or thrift and not the aggregate amount of bank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and thrift assets held by the holding company or, alternatively, that the asset 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit be raised. Many community and governmental groups, on the other hand, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believed that the asset limit should be lowered. After considering all of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments, the agencies have decided to retain the definition of small institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
set forth in the December proposal. No compelling evidence was presented to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
support a change of the asset limit. Further, the revised proposal reflects the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notion that the CRA performance of a small independent institution or small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affiliate institution of a small holding company should be measured against 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different standards than a small institution affiliate of a larger holding company. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The consideration of assessment context added in the revised proposal will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit the agencies to make this differentiation. The larger holding company 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could be expected to provide support and assistance to a degree not available to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a small independent institution or to an affiliate institution of a small holding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
company.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters from small institutions criticized the presumption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the December proposal that a 60% loan-to-deposit ratio was reasonable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These commenters pointed out that economic conditions, institutional capacity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and other constraints may result in loan-to-deposit ratios significantly below this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
figure. Although the agencies did not intend the December proposal to suggest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a loan-to-deposit ratio below 60% would have been presumed less than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable, the agencies have eliminated the use of any fixed percentage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Instead, the revised proposal would require that an institution's loan to deposit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ratio, adjusted for seasonal variation and, as appropriate, other lending related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities, must be reasonable given the institution's size, financial condition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the credit needs of its service area. The adjustment for lending related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities, such as secondary market sales and community development lending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and investment, is new in the revised proposal. This provision responds to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerns that institutions that package and sell their loans would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disadvantaged, compared to portfolio lenders, by a strict loan-to-deposit ratio 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test. The proposed adjustment also addresses concerns raised by commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the small institution assessment method in the December proposal would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have ignored the community development lending performance of small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many industry commenters also criticized the requirement in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
December proposal that, to be presumed to be performing satisfactorily, an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution would have needed a good loan mix, which would have included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offering, to the extent permitted by law, a variety of loans to customers across 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic levels. These commenters were concerned that an institution would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been required to offer all permissible loan products to all customers. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies agree that the focus on the types of products offered was inconsistent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the tenor of the proposed regulation as a whole and have altered the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criterion in the revised proposal to eliminate any requirement concerning the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
types of products that an institution offers. The revised proposal would retain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the aspect of the criterion focussing on lending to customers across economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a related change, the revised proposal would broaden the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criterion in the December proposal concerning the distribution of loans by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions required to report loan data under HMDA. The revised proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would explicitly provide that the agencies would consider the geographic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of loans of all small institutions, not just these subject to HMDA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies believe this consideration was implicit in the December proposal, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which required lending across economic levels. In any event, the agencies do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not intend this change to result in any increased documentation burden on small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions. The geographic analysis would be performed by the agencies' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examiners and would not be required of the institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies also received comments questioning the meaning of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the criterion in the December proposal focussing on the complaint record of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small institutions. Because of concerns by commenters that a ``legitimate, bona- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fide complaint'' was not adequately defined, the agencies have now proposed a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criterion that would focus on the institution's record of taking appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action, as warranted, in response to written complaints about its CRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters expressed concern that the December proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was unclear regarding the circumstances under which a small institution could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have earned an ``outstanding'' or less than ``satisfactory'' rating. The changes in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the revised proposal clarify and conform the treatment of small banks to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement proposed for large retail institutions_that lending performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be ``satisfactory'' for an institution to receive an overall satisfactory rating. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the revised proposal, the agencies would consider a small institution's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investment and service performance in order to determine whether it is eligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for an ``outstanding'' rating. Strong investment or service performance could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
help boost a small institution's rating to the ``outstanding'' level. Poor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investment or service performance would not lower a small institution's rating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
below ``satisfactory'' but could prevent the institution from receiving an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``outstanding'' rating. The agencies would not consider investment and service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance to offset less than ``satisfactory'' performance by a small institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the basic assessment criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised proposal also reflects minor changes to clarify the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment of small institutions. The agencies have eliminated the criterion in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the December proposal relating to discrimination because the issue is addressed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the section on the assignment of overall ratings. In addition, consistent with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the changes in the proposal for large institutions, the discussion of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examination procedures for small institutions with multiple service areas has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been eliminated.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Strategic Plan Assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The December proposal would have provided that, as an alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to being rated under the lending, service, and investment tests, or the small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution assessment standards, an institution could submit to its supervisory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency for approval a strategic plan detailing how the institution proposed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meet its CRA obligation. The December proposal would have required that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan be submitted three months in advance of its effective date, and that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution solicit public comment on the plan at the time the plan is submitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the agency. No plan would have been approved unless it provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurable goals for proposed performance and those goals constituted at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfactory performance under the standards of the regulation. No plan could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have had a term beyond two years, and the institution could have petitioned the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency to amend the plan on the grounds that a material change of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances made the plan no longer appropriate. The agency would have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessed the CRA performance of the institution under the plan. If the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution failed to meet or exceed the preponderance of its goals, its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance would have been evaluated against the lending, service and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investment tests or the small institution assessment method, as applicable. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preamble to the December proposal stated that an institution operating under an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved strategic plan would not be relieved of its obligation to report data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The concerns regarding the strategic plan option most consistently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
raised by the comments were the December proposal's lack of details 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerning important aspects of how the plan option would operate and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nature of public input into the process. The revised proposal would provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantially more detail about the operation of the plan option than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
December proposal, and would modify the December proposal in other respects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as well. In the revised proposal, the agencies have attempted to provide a real 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative to the standard lending, investment, and service tests through the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strategic plan option, while assuring that those operating under a plan are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to a CRA assessment that is no less stringent and performance-based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than the proposed standard tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised proposal would substantially revise the provisions in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the December proposal regarding public participation in the plan process. An 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution would be required to informally seek suggestions from the public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
while developing the plan. Once the institution had developed the plan, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution would be required to formally solicit public comment on the plan for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at least 30 days. The agencies have decided not to extend the minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment period to avoid unduly lengthening the plan process. After the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment period, the institution would submit the plan to its regulator, along 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with any comments received, and, if the plan was revised in light of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments received, the plan in the form released for public comment. Under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the revised proposal, a submitted plan would be approved if the agency fails to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
act on the plan within 60 days after submission, unless the agency extended the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review period for good cause. Until a plan was approved, an institution would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be subject to the standard performance tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These changes would increase the opportunity for productive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community input in the plan process. By requiring an institution to seek 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
informal suggestions in formulating a plan, and then to solicit formal comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before submitting a plan to the agency, this process will encourage consultation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between an institution and its community, including local government, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community leaders, and the public. There would not be a further comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period after the institution submits its proposed plan to the agency because such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a comment period could undermine the direct communication and consultation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between an institution and its community that is most beneficial to the process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised proposal would provide that, in evaluating a plan, the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would consider the public's involvement in formulating the plan and any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
response by the institution to public comment on the plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments appeared to misunderstand why the strategic plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would provide for input from the public. The plan option would provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions an opportunity to tailor their CRA objectives to the needs of their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community and their capacity and expertise. Few comments suggested that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution would be able to determine the needs of its community without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consulting in some fashion with those in the community. Several industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments were concerned that under the strategic plan option, community 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organizations would play an inappropriate role in an institution's operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the purpose of the consultation would be for the institution to develop 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information about the needs of its community and how they might be met so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it can make better judgments when formulating its plan objectives. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision regarding how the institution is to meet those needs would remain with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution. In reviewing the public participation, the agencies would not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider whether community organizations unanimously supported the plan, but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether the institution made an appropriate investigation to determine the needs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of its community, and whether, considering the information about community 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit needs that the institution received in the comments, the plan goals are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate. The agencies would evaluate strategic plans and their proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurable goals in the assessment context against which the tests and standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the proposed regulation would be applied.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The revised proposal also would provide significantly more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance regarding the standards for approval of a plan. Commenters on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
December proposal were divided over the standards for approval. Some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters thought the regulation should state that the standards for approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a plan are the same as the standards on the lending, service, and investment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tests, or that the plan should require no less lending than the lending test. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contrast, some industry commenters thought that the plan would not provide a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
real alternative unless it permitted an institution to depart from the standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tests in responding to local needs. Under the revised proposal, a plan would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have to specify measurable goals for helping to meet the credit needs of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's service area, particularly the needs of low- and moderate-income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
geographies and low- and moderate-income individuals. These goals would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have to reflect the institution's capacity and constraints, product offerings, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business strategy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised proposal would require that the plan specify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurable goals in lending, investment, and the provision of services, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate to the circumstances. The proposal would specify the broad criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in lending, investment, and services that should be the framework for the plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
goals. At the same time, however, the proposal would make clear that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution has great flexibility to fashion its program within those parameters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An institution would not be required to set levels of performance in all three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categories. In order to maintain the focus on lending for retail institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operating under a plan, a retail institution's goals would have to emphasize 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lending and lending-related activities, unless a different emphasis were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate given the credit needs of the service area, public comment, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's capacity and constraints. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies intend through these provisions to provide guidance to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the industry and the community regarding the standards for plan approval, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
while preserving substantial flexibility for institutions to tailor their CRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. The purpose of the plan is not to provide institutions operating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under a plan with a different or lesser obligation to help meet the needs of their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community; it is to provide more certainty and flexibility for those institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that wish to meet their obligation in a fashion that they believe may not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriately assessed by the standard performance tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised proposal would require that each plan specify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurable goals, the satisfaction of which, the institution believes, would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warrant a ``satisfactory'' rating. An institution also would have the option of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identifying a separate set of goals that, if met, would warrant an ``outstanding'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rating. An institution would not be considered for a rating of outstanding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unless its plan contained outstanding goals that had been approved by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relevant agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised proposal also would clarify how performance would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessed under the plan. The agencies believe that the standard of performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the December proposal should be strengthened, and the revised proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would require an institution to substantially achieve its plan goals to receive that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rating. This would apply to the satisfactory rating and, if the plan contained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such approved goals, to the outstanding rating. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters believed that the possibility of being considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the standard tests, as contemplated by the December proposal, made the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan a less attractive alternative to the standard tests. The revised proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would, unless the institution chose otherwise, rate an institution's performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under an approved plan solely in relation to its plan goals. An institution would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have the option, however, to elect in its plan to be subject to the standard tests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should its performance under the plan goals be less than satisfactory. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies intend that an institution operating under an approved plan would, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the period of the plan, never be subject to assessment under the standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tests, unless the institution so chose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to industry comments that said the two year plan term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the December proposal was too short to warrant the expense of preparing a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan and to permit institutions to initiate activities with a longer view, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies have lengthened the possible plan term to 5 years, but would require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the plan to have annual interim measurable goals. The agencies agree that it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beneficial to provide institutions the opportunity for long-range planning, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the interim goals should enable effective examinations during the plan period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal also would permit an institution to develop a single plan for one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or more or all of its service areas and allow affiliated institutions to prepare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
joint plans.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of industry commenters indicated that the possibility of public disclosure of confidential information
presented a major disincentive to their use of the strategic plan alternative. The revised proposal would allow institutions
to submit additional information to the relevant agency on a confidential basis. However, the publicly available
information would have to be sufficiently specific to enable the public and the agency to judge fairly the merits of
the plan's goals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised proposal also would provide more detail regarding plan amendment. An institution would be able to petition
for an amendment on the grounds that a material change in circumstances had made the plan no longer appropriate. In
order to preserve the integrity of the public participation in the plan process, any proposed amendment would have
to go through the public consultation and comment process described earlier in this preamble. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Despite industry comments to the contrary, the revised proposal continues to provide that approval of a plan would
not affect an institution's data collection responsibilities. The data are useful to the agencies in assessing overall
lending in communities, and would also be of value to the public. Since the institution's plan would be in its public
file, the public would have the appropriate context in which to evaluate the lending data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised proposal also clarifies that evidence of discrimination would affect an institution's rating based
on plan performance in the same manner as such evidence would affect an institution's rating calculated pursuant
to the standard tests.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the December proposal, institutions would have been assigned one of four overall, or composite, ratings, as
required by the statute: ``outstanding'', ``satisfactory'', ``needs to improve'', and ``substantial noncompliance''.
In the December proposal, ratings on the lending, investment, and service test were combined into a composite rating.
For a retail institution, the institution's rating under the lending test would have served as the base rating. This
base rating would then have been increased by two levels in the case of outstanding investment performance or by one
level in the case of high satisfactory investment performance. For a wholesale or limited-purpose institution,
the institution's rating under the investment test would have served as the basis for the overall rating. For any institution,
the rating would have been increased by one level in the case of an ``outstanding'' rating for service and decreased
by one level in the case of a ``substantial non-compliance'' rating for service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the lending, service and investment tests had five rating levels rather than four, the rating would then have
been converted to the statutorily-required four level rating system, with ``high satisfactory'' and ``low satisfactory''
both scored as ``satisfactory''. An institution that would otherwise have received a ``needs to improve'' rating
would have been rated in ``substantial noncompliance'' if the institution received no better than a ``needs to improve''
rating on each of its two previous examinations. Finally, the rating would have been adjusted to take into account
any illegal lending discrimination by the institution to arrive at a final composite rating. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters, particularly community and consumer groups, were concerned that the rating system proposed in
December permitted a retail institution with poor lending performance to achieve a satisfactory or outstanding
overall rating through outstanding performance on the investment and service tests. These commenters asked that
no retail institution be permitted to achieve a satisfactory overall rating unless it received a satisfactory rating
on the lending test. The revised proposal would ensure that lending performance receives sufficient weight by weighing
a retail institution's rating on the lending test so as to count for at least 50 percent of its overall rating. Furthermore,
a retail institution would be required to achieve a rating of satisfactory on the lending test in order to receive an
overall rating of satisfactory. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters were concerned that investment and service performance only affected an institution's overall
rating at the margins_if investment or service performance was extraordinarily strong or weak. The revised proposal
would allow investment and service performance to boost an institution's rating provided the institution had achieved
a rating of satisfactory on the lending test. Poor performance on either the investment or service test could negatively
affect an institution's overall performance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These principles would be implemented through the process described in paragraph (b) of Appendix A for assigning
a rating for retail institutions assessed under the lending, service and investment tests. Points would be assigned
to an institution's performance on each of the underlying tests. The total number of points would determine the composite
rating, unless the total exceeds twice the number of points attributable to the institution's performance under
the lending test. In that case, the composite rating would be determined using twice the number of points attributable
to the institution's lending performance to ensure that lending performance accounts for at least 50 percent of the
overall rating. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Small institutions, wholesale or limited purpose institutions, or institutions with an approved strategic plan
would be rated as described in paragraphs (c) through (e) of Appendix A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As in the December proposal, the revised proposal would require the agencies to adjust ratings for all institutions,
regardless of the method of CRA evaluation, to take evidence of discrimination or other illegal credit practices
into consideration. In addition, the revised proposal, as in December's proposal, provides that an institution
that otherwise would receive a needs to improve rating would be rated in substantial noncompliance if it received
no better than a needs to improve rating on each of its two previous examinations.

Lending Discrimination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the December proposal, an institution would presumptively have received a final CRA rating of less than satisfactory
if the institution (1) committed an isolated act of illegal discrimination of which it had knowledge that it had not
corrected fully or was not in the process of correcting fully or (2) engaged in a pattern or practice of illegal discrimination
that it had not corrected fully. The presumption could have been rebutted in the case of technical or de minimis violations,
for example, if an institution violated the Equal Credit Opportunity Act by offering a preferential credit program
for individuals over age 55 (rather than limiting the program to individuals over age 62 as the law requires). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many community and consumer groups criticized this proposal as a retreat from current practice. They pointed out
that the existing regulation provides that the agencies will consider any evidence of discriminatory or other illegal
credit practices. Although the agencies did not intend in the December proposal to reduce the weight given evidence
of illegal discrimination in the CRA evaluation process, they believe that the commenters' concerns should be addressed.
The revised proposal conforms with the language of the existing regulation. Also, the discrimination provisions
in the revised proposal would avoid the use of a rebuttable presumption consistent with the elimination of presumptions
throughout the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the revised proposal, any evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices would adversely affect
the agencies' evaluation of an institution's CRA rating. In determining the effect on an institution's rating, the
agencies would consider the nature and extent of the evidence, the policies and procedures that the institution has
in place to prevent discriminatory or other illegal credit practices, any corrective action that the institution
has taken or has committed to take, particularly voluntary corrective action resulting from self-assessment, and
other relevant information, such as the institution's past fair lending performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There was also some confusion regarding whether the December proposal intended that illegal discrimination would
have the same effect for all institutions regardless of the assessment method that they chose. The revised proposal
makes clear that evidence of discrimination would be considered in assigning a rating to all banks and thrifts, regardless
of whether they were evaluated under the lending, service, and investment tests, the community development test
for wholesale or limited purpose banks, the small institution assessment method, or the strategic plan option.

Multiple Service Areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The preamble to the December proposal stated that an institution's CRA rating should reflect its performance in all
the local communities in which it does business. However, the proposed regulatory language provided that the agencies
would conduct full lending, service, and investment tests (or the other appropriate assessments) in a sample of the
service areas in which the institution operated. The agencies would then assign separate composite ratings for each
area. The institution's overall rating would reflect the performance of the institution in all service areas studied.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters urged the agencies to conduct assessments in every one of an institution's service areas, because
every institution has an obligation to help meet the credit needs of all of its service areas. These commenters and
others also expressed concern that the regulation did not provide clear rules as to how performance in each of the service
areas assessed would be combined to arrive at an overall rating for the institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An institution is obligated to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including all of the institution's
service areas. However, ensuring that institutions fulfill this responsibility does not necessarily require that
an institution's performance in each of its service areas must be examined. Questions of how many service areas should
be examined during an examination and how performance in different service areas should be weighed are more appropriately
handled through examination procedures than through regulatory language. The agencies have therefore omitted
from the revised proposal all discussion of examination treatment of multiple service areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies note that the Interstate Banking Efficiency Act would establish requirements for the examination of
multi-state and other institutions. This proposal and examination procedures will be modified as necessary to comply
with that Act if it becomes law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Effect of Ratings on Applications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CRA requires the agencies to consider an institution's CRA performance record when considering an application
by the institution to establish a deposit facility (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, branch). The December proposal specified how CRA ratings would be considered in applications. For example, an application
from an institution with a ``substantial noncompliance'' CRA rating would have generally been denied, whereas an
application from an institution with an ``outstanding'' rating would have been given extra weight. A ``satisfactory''
rating generally would have been consistent with approval of an application and a ``needs to improve'' rating, absent
other evidence, generally would have resulted in a denial or conditional approval of an application. The agencies
emphasized, however, that the CRA examination rating is not conclusive and recognized that other information related
to CRA performance and the convenience and needs of communities, including information collected through public
comment and reports, is also relevant and would be considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although not intended as such, a number of the commenters believed these provisions would have provided institutions
with a ``safe harbor'' from challenges to their performance record in the applications process if they achieved an
``outstanding'' CRA examination rating. Those commenters were concerned that they could be prevented from effectively
commenting on the CRA performance aspects relevant to applications and urged that those provisions be dropped. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The discussion of the effect of particular ratings on applications in the December proposal was not intended to alter
the agencies' policy of considering examination ratings and public comment during the applications process and
has been deleted. As stated in the December proposal, the agencies have consistently recognized that materials relating
to CRA performance received during the applications process from public comments and other sources, can and do provide
relevant and valuable information. The revised proposal explicitly states that interested parties would have the
opportunity to comment on applications and that the agencies would take their views into account in considering the
CRA performance of an institution in the applications process. The agencies continue to believe, as provided in the
Interagency Policy Statement Regarding the Community Reinvestment Act, that information from an examination is
a particularly important consideration in the applications process because it represents the on-site evaluation
of an institution's CRA performance by its primary federal regulator. The revised proposal also would specify that
an institution's record of CRA performance would be considered in an institution's expansion proposals (as defined
in the CRA) and may be the basis for approving, denying, or conditioning approval of an application.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Definition of Service Area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The December proposal would have replaced the concept of ``delineated community'' in the existing regulation with
the concept of service area. The December proposal would have defined service area as the area around each institution's
office or group of offices where the preponderance of direct reportable loans made through those offices are located.
A service area would have been presumed acceptable if it was broad enough to include low- and moderate-income geographies
and did not arbitrarily exclude such geographies. An institution had the opportunity to show there were no low- and
moderate-income geographies within a reasonable distance given its size and financial condition, and the supervisory
agency could reject an otherwise acceptable service area if the service area did not account for the true effective
lending territory of the institution or if it reflected past redlining or illegal discrimination. The proposal would
have required an institution to delineate multiple service areas if the geographies it served extended substantially
across state boundaries or the boundaries of a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). An institution serving military
customers would have been permitted to delineate a ``military community'' consisting of those customers. Each institution
would also have been required to compile and maintain a list of all the geographies within its service area or areas
and a map of each service area. The December proposal would not have required wholesale or limited purpose institutions
to delineate a service area, but would have treated all low- and moderate-income geographies in the country as the
service area for wholesale or limited purpose institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of numerous comments received on this issue, the revised proposal makes several changes to the definition.
Several commenters suggested that the proposed regulation adopt concepts from the existing regulation, including
the equidistance provision that requires an institution to include those areas around its offices where it makes
a substantial portion of its loans and all other areas equidistant from its offices as those areas. The revised proposal
would adopt the equidistance principle from the current regulation in slightly modified form. The equidistance
requirement is an effective tool to assure that the delineation of a service area is consistent with the purposes of
the statute and that institutions do not draw their service areas too narrowly. This modification clarifies the service
area requirement and builds on concepts with which the industry and community already have experience. This change
does not significantly modify the substance of the December proposal, since the December proposal preamble stated
that a service area conforming to the equidistance concept would generally have been acceptable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised proposal also incorporates the concept of ``local area'' from the current regulation. This responds
to comments expressing concern that loans made a substantial distance from a branch might inappropriately expand
the scope of a service area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised proposal would delete the requirement that a service area be broad enough to include low- and moderate-income
areas. The necessity for this requirement was unclear, given the provision preventing institutions from arbitrarily
excluding low- and moderate-income geographies. The proposal would clarify that the requirement that low- or moderate-income
geographies not be arbitrarily excluded would take into account the institution's size, financial condition, and
the extent of its branching network. An institution's performance evaluation would include an account of how many
low- and moderate-income geographies are included in the institution's service area(s). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised proposal would clarify that an institution's service area is derived from its direct lending in relation
to its branches and proprietary deposit-taking ATMs, rather than its other non-deposit-taking offices. This appropriately
links an institution's CRA obligations to where it takes deposits, while enabling the agencies to review whether
the institution is serving the needs of its entire community in the manner in which it extends credit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industry commenters were particularly concerned that the December proposal meant that lending conducted by non-branch
offices, such as loan production offices, would expand an institution's service area. The revised proposal would
not require an institution to include geographies where an institution has made loans through a loan production office,
unless those geographies are in the local area around a deposit-taking branch or ATM. However, an institution would
be free to include such geographies if it wishes, and the regulation would provide some incentive to do so. Under the
revised proposal, if an agency determined that lending by an institution's affiliate(s) was integral to the business
of the institution, then it would include the lending by that affiliate in its assessment of the institution's lending
performance, even if the institution had not requested the agency to do so. In addition, by limiting the size of its
service area, an institution would increase the likelihood that it would perform poorly on the criterion of the lending
test that considers the proportion of the institution's total lending in its service area(s).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Rather than requiring the service area to include those geographies accounting for a ``preponderance'' of the institution's
loans, as in the December proposal, or the areas accounting for a ``substantial portion'' of the institution's loans,
as in the existing regulation, the revised proposal would require the service area to include those geographies in
which the institution has made ``a significant number and amount of loans.'' The agencies intend the meaning of ``significant''
to be broad, and to include all geographies around its branches and proprietary deposit-taking ATMs where an institution
has made more than a handful of loans. Because of this change in the proposal, the criterion in the small institution
assessment method that requires a majority of an institution's loans to be in its service area(s) for a satisfactory
rating would not be redundant as it might have been in the December proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the revised proposal, as in the December proposal, the agencies would consider whether the delineation reflects
illegal discrimination, and thus would, as some commenters suggested, consider the racial composition of geographies
in reviewing an institution's delineation. The agencies have eliminated the term ``redlining'' because the agencies
believe that term is included in the term ``illegal discrimination.'' In this regard, illegal discrimination includes
the practice of refusing to lend to an area or neighborhood on the basis of race or other prohibited bases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters thought that the agencies should require institutions to justify the methodology for delineations,
and that the regulation expressly provide for community input into the delineation. Under the revised proposal,
examiners would review whether the service area meets the requirements of the regulation, but the agencies would
not prescribe or review the method by which an institution defines its service area. Rather than having the agencies
determine whether a delineation is ``reasonable,'' it is simpler and more effective in meeting the purposes of the
statute to focus on the lending patterns of the institution, whether low- and moderate income areas are excluded,
and whether the service area reflects illegal discrimination. Furthermore, the revised proposal would not expressly
provide for community input into the delineation. As part of the assessment context, agency staff would review comments
from the community with regard to the performance of an institution, including its delineation of its service area(s).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised proposal would retain the requirement from the December proposal that institutions delineate multiple
service areas, with clarifying modifications. The revised proposal would not require institutions to delineate
an MSA or other political boundary. The requirements that would govern under the revised proposal should prevent
institutions from inappropriately limiting their service area(s) in order to exclude certain geographies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters suggested requiring the service area to include full census tracts and block numbering areas to facilitate
data collection and reporting. The agencies agree, and the revised proposal would contain such a requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While comments generally supported the separate treatment of wholesale or limited purpose institutions, many commenters
questioned whether wholesale or limited purpose institutions should have nationwide service areas and suggested
that more consideration should be given to qualified investments in the institution's local area. Some commenters
claimed that permitting wholesale banks to define a ``national community'' violated the ``local community'' orientation
of the statute. The revised proposal would eliminate a mandatory nationwide service area for wholesale or limited
purpose institutions. Such institutions have chosen to locate in particular communities, and it is appropriate
that their CRA performance reflect their location. The revised proposal would therefore require that a wholesale
or limited purpose institution designate as its service area the area or areas around its offices, or a broader statewide
or regional area that includes such areas. The institution would have a broad scope in preparing this designation,
so long as the area meets the purposes of the CRA and does not arbitrarily exclude low and moderate income geographies.
Performance under the community development test would focus on qualified investments, community development
loans outstanding and community development services that benefit the areas within the institution's service area.
Qualifying activities that benefit areas outside the institution's service area would be considered up to an amount
equal to the amount of qualifying activities within the institution's service area. However, if the institution
could demonstrate only a limited need or opportunity to provide qualifying activities within its service area, the
appropriate agency could modify or eliminate this limitation.

Data Collection and Reporting
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The December proposal would have required institutions that were not eligible for the small institution streamlined
assessment method to collect and report to the agencies data showing the geographic distribution of written applications,
application denials, originations and purchases for home mortgage, small business and small farm, and consumer
loans. Home mortgage loans would have included all mortgage loans reportable under HMDA and its implementing regulations.
The proposal would have required institutions to report separately information covering loans for home purchase,
home improvement, multifamily dwellings, and refinancings. Small business loans would have included all loans
to private, for-profit organizations that in the fiscal year preceding the making of the loan had gross receipts of
less than $10 million (for a firm providing services), or up to 500 employees (for a manufacturing firm). As proposed,
institutions would have had to separate such loans into in four categories based on the sales volume of the business.
Small farm loans would have been defined to include all loans to private organizations engaged in farming operations
with gross receipts of less than $500,000 in the fiscal year preceding the making of the loan. Consumer loans would
have been defined to include all closed-end loans, secured and unsecured, extended to a natural person primarily
for personal, family, or household purposes, except for credit card loans and motorized vehicle loans and those loans
included in the definition of home mortgage loans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The December proposal would also have required institutions to report data in summary form by geography for each of
the three major loan categories_mortgages, small businesses and small farms, and consumer_by January 31 of each
calendar year. The data would have covered the related lending activity that took place in the preceding calendar
year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters raised general concerns regarding the data collection requirements in the December proposal. As
discussed later in this preamble, the agencies have streamlined requirements to reduce burden. In addition, the
agencies plan to make software available to institutions to facilitate compliance with the proposed requirements.
The agencies have proposed the data collection and reporting requirements in this revised proposal as a means for
permitting the agencies to fulfill their responsibilities under the CRA of assessing each institution's record
of helping to meet the credit needs of the community. This proposal has also been made to permit the agencies to discuss
the facts supporting the agencies' conclusions regarding the institution's record of lending.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments on the proposed data collection raised five principal concerns, all of which have been addressed in the
revised proposal. First, many commenters indicated that the proposed rules would be overly burdensome and, in the
case of home mortgage loans, would have required duplicative tracking of data. Under the revised proposal, the agencies
would base their analysis of mortgage lending on the data already reported pursuant to HMDA. To acquire more geographic
detail on home mortgage lending, the agencies propose to amend the HMDA regulation to require that institutions other
than small banks and thrifts report the geography of applications, approvals, and denials for loans secured by properties
outside the institution's MSA, data that is already reported on a voluntary basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, some commenters questioned whether the need for consumer loan data justified the burden of mandatory reporting.
However, many of the same commenters suggested that if consumer loan data were to be required, the data should include
all consumer loans, including credit card loans and motor vehicle loans, which were not included in the collection
and reporting requirements of the December proposal. Some institutions indicated that consumer lending was an important
aspect of their CRA performance that should be considered by the agencies. The revised proposal would offer institutions
the option of collecting data on the amount outstanding, the location of the borrower, and the income of the borrower
for each open-end and closed-end consumer loan outstanding as of the end of the calendar year. Such data is typically
required by all institutions as an integral part of their loan underwriting procedures. If an institution selected
this option, the foregoing data would be reviewed during the institution's CRA examination but would not be reported
to the agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, many lenders criticized the December proposal's inclusion of information on small business applications
and application denials. Those commenters indicated that reporting should be limited to loan outstandings or loan
originations. The revised proposal would simplify the definition of small business and small farm loans, by adopting
the definition of those terms now used by institutions for purposes of completing, in the case of banks, their Reports
of Condition and Income (Call Reports), and in the case of thrifts, the Thrift Financial Report (TFR). Under the revised
proposal, institutions would collect and report data on a loan-by-loan basis for all loans included in the aggregate
small business and small farm loan figures on the institution's Call Report or TFR, which includes business loans
with original amounts under $1 million and farm loans with original amounts under $500,000. These data would include
the outstanding balance as of December 31 of each year, the location of the business or farm or the location where the
loan proceeds would be applied (as indicated by the borrower), an indication of whether the borrower has annual revenues
of less than or equal to $1 million, and an indication of whether the borrower (if not publicly traded) is more than 50
percent owned by one or more minority individuals or by one or more women. The loan register information would be required
to be submitted at the same time and in accordance with the provisions for submitting HMDA data as provided in 12 CFR
Part 203 (Regulation C). In addition, the revised proposal would change the date on which Call Report or TFR data on
small business and small farms loans would be required to be submitted from June 30 to December 31 of each year to coincide
with the calendar year reporting requirements of HMDA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Fourth, many commenters criticized the failure of the December proposal to require the collection of data on the race
and gender of borrowers except to the extent such data was required by current law. These commenters were particularly
interested in the reporting of race and gender data for small business loans in order to support the fair lending component
of the CRA assessment. In response to these comments, the revised proposal would require institutions to collect
certain race and gender data in connection with their small business and small farm lending. Each institution would
be required to request, either in connection with a written application or, if the institution did not use written
applications, at an appropriate point in the lending process, that an applicant or borrower indicate the percentage
of the business or farm owned by men and by women as well as the percentages owned by members of different racial and ethnic
categories. If the institution neither takes a written application nor originates the loan, the institution would
not be required to request the information. To protect the privacy of individual borrowers, this detailed information
would not be included on loan registers, which, as noted earlier in this preamble, would only indicate whether an individual
loan was to a business or farm that was more than 50 percent women-owned or more than 50 percent minority-owned. The
institution would also retain but not report or disclose the information on applicants who did not receive a loan.
To further safeguard privacy, the loan registers would not be disclosed to the public but the institutions would include
aggregate information about the loans in their public CRA files.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, some commenters were concerned that because community development loans were not required to be reported,
examiners would not give them sufficient weight in evaluating an institution's lending performance. The revised
proposal would require institutions to report on their Call Reports and TFRs the aggregate number and dollar amount
of community development loans outstanding as of December 31 of each year.

The December proposal would have required institutions to make available for public inspection: (1) a file containing
all the signed, written comments that it had received from the public for the past two years; (2) its performance data
for that period; (3) maps of its service areas (with lists of the census tracts or block numbering areas that make up
each service area); and (4) a copy of the public section of its most recent CRA Performance Evaluation. If an institution
elected to be assessed under the strategic plan option, it would have been required to include a copy of its plan in the
public file. The December proposal would have required the institution to maintain the public file at its main office
and to make available copies of the file at cost to members of the public. Materials relating to a given service area
would have been maintained at each branch in that service area, and every institution would have been required to post
in the public lobby of each branch a notice of its CRA obligation and the public's opportunity to comment on and review
data concerning that performance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters generally favored the public disclosure of an institution's CRA-related activities, and the revised
proposal retains all the relevant public disclosure provisions of the December proposal. The revised proposal modifies
the required contents of the public file to reflect proposed changes in the various assessment tests and the proposed
data collection requirements for small business and small farm loans. For example, consistent with the proposed
service test, the revised proposal would require an institution to maintain a list of its branches and ATMs along with
their locations and the services generally available at such facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To protect the privacy of borrowers and the competitive information of institutions, the revised proposal would
not require an institution to include the small business or small farm loan registers containing information on individual
applicants in its public file. Instead, the revised proposal would require the public disclosure of aggregated information
on small business and small farm loans for the past two calendar years by every institution (other than a small institution).
Loan registers would be available to agency examiners to confirm the accuracy of the aggregated data but the agencies
do not intend to make unaggregated information publicly available.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the revised proposal, the following aggregated loan data for small business and small farm loans would be placed
in the public file: (1) the number and amount of loans in low-,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
moderate-, middle-, and upper-income geographies; (2) a list of the geographies in which an institution made at least
one loan; (3) the number and amount of loans inside and outside the institution's service area; (4) the number and amount
of loans to minority- and women-owned businesses; and (5) the number and amount of loans to businesses and farms with
annual revenues equal to or less than $1 million. Institutions would also be required to disclose the number and amount
of community development loans outstanding. Institutions may elect to disclose publicly the number and amount of
consumer loans to individuals and geographies by various income levels, and the number and amount of these loans made
within and outside its service area(s). However, to protect the privacy interests of borrowers, an institution may
not place in its public file any loan information described above for a particular year if special circumstances,
such as a small number of loans or a limited number of geographies in the designated categories, could reasonably be
expected to disclose the borrower's identity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A small institution would be required to include its loan-to-deposit ratio computed at the end of the most recent calendar
year. The institution could include other data on its loan-to-deposit ratio if it believed the data would give a more
accurate picture of its lending and lending-related activities. If a small institution elects to be rated under the
lending, investment, and service tests applicable to larger institutions, it would be required to include in its
public file all of the lending information described earlier in this preamble. An institution electing to be assessed
under an approved plan would continue to provide a copy of its plan in the public file but would not have to disclose information
submitted to the agencies on a confidential basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to comments, the agencies have modified the provisions regarding the location of the public file. The
complete public file would be required to be maintained at the institution's main office. In addition, at least one
branch in each service area would be required to have copies of the bank's HMDA Disclosure Statements and all materials
in the public file relating to the service area in which the branch is located. If a member of the public requested to
review a bank's public file at a branch that did not have a copy, the bank would have to make a complete copy of the file
for that service area available for review at the branch within 5 business days at no cost.

Public Notice

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The December proposal would have required that institutions provide the Community Reinvestment Act Notice ``in
the public lobby of its head office and each branch,'' and it would have set forth the Notice. The revised proposal makes
minor changes to the Notice requirements. The term ``head office'' is changed to ``main office'' for clarity. Within
the Notice, the statement of what is included in the CRA performance file would be expanded to describe more accurately
the contents of the file. In addition, the revised proposal would require that the file include a map identifying the
institution's service area, a list of its branches and ATMs in its service area, and a list of services the institution
provides at each of the foregoing locations.

The December proposal would have required that each agency publish a list of the banks scheduled for CRA exams in each
calendar quarter at least 30 days before the beginning of the quarter, and permitted members of the public to submit
comments about a bank's CRA performance. The revised proposal would leave intact the provision concerning timing
of publication, but delete as redundant the provision concerning public comment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Transition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The December proposal would have established a transition period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from July 1, 1994, to April 1, 1996. Institutions subject to data collection and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting requirements would have been required to begin collecting home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mortgage, small business, and consumer loan data on July 1, 1994. The data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would have been reported to the agencies no later than January 31, 1995, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annually thereafter. Evaluations under the proposed standards would have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
begun April 1, 1995. However, any institution could have elected to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluated under the existing twelve assessment factors rather than the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards until July 1, 1995, and any institution showing cause could have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested evaluation under the existing standards up to April 1, 1996. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies would have accepted strategic plans for approval at any time after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
publication of the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The December proposal, in addition, would have insulated some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions from supervisory sanctions until they had been subject to at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two examinations under the proposed standards. Specifically, the agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not have disapproved corporate applications or taken any enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action against an institution whose initial CRA rating under the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards dropped by more than one level, if the agencies determined that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drop in ratings occurred despite a good faith effort to achieve at least a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfactory level of performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many of the commenters criticized the transition period in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
December proposal for being too short. Those commenters were particularly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical of the proposal to begin collection of data on July 1, 1994. Several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters suggested that the proposed data collection be delayed as much as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12 months after the publication of a final rule. Some also criticized the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal to begin conducting examinations in 1995 using a partial year's data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the second half of 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters criticized the proposal to insulate certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions from supervisory actions until they had gained more experience with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed standards. Those commenters were generally concerned that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal would have protected institutions whose performance ratings would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have suffered as a result of more objective, performance-based assessments.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In developing the revised proposal, the agencies sought to address 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these concerns in two principal ways. First, despite substantial simplification in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data collection compared to the December proposal, the revised proposal would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide institutions additional time before the data collection would begin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the revised proposal, collection of new data elements would not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required until July 1, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, compared to the December proposal, the revised proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eliminates the grace period and instead would provide institutions with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional time before assessments under the proposed standards would become 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandatory. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised proposal would also provide institutions with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment options prior to full implementation of the rule. Even though 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessments under the proposed standards would not be mandatory until 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
July 1, 1996, small institutions would have the opportunity to be examined, at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their option, under the small bank assessment method anytime after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
July 1, 1995. Anytime on or after July 1, 1995, an institution could also elect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to submit for approval a strategic plan to achieve satisfactory or better CRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance. Examinations under approved strategic plans could begin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
July 1, 1996. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed transition schedule, the current regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be repealed in its entirety on July 1, 1996. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies recognize that the revised proposal, like the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
December proposal, represents a significant change in existing practices and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that cautious administration is therefore required. Consultation by financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions with the agencies on compliance with the new standards and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures will be encouraged, as will liberal use of agency appeals processes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The supervisory agencies will engage in an internal review of the effectiveness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the new regulations. The agencies contemplate reconsideration of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations to improve their effectiveness within the next several years. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies intend for the proposed regulations to require demonstrated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance but to impose as little unnecessary compliance burden as possible, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the agencies will review the regulations to determine whether they are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advancing these goals.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to this rulemaking, the agencies will work together to

improve examiner training and to increase interagency coordination regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application of standards, performance of examinations, assignment of ratings, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and use of enforcement tools. The agencies will work together to make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examinations as short in duration as possible, to minimize unnecessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance burden, and to ensure consistency and reliability in the rating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process.

With respect to the reporting, disclosure, and other administrative

compliance requirements in the proposal, the agencies invite comment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) any administrative burdens that these requirements in the revised proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would place on depository institutions, including small depository institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and customers of depository institutions; and (2) the benefits of these

 For all the reasons discussed in the joint preamble, it is hereby certified that this proposed rule, if adopted as a
final rule, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small banks. This proposal would
enable most small banks to avoid the data collection requirements in 12 CFR Part 228 and will encourage greater small
business lending by financial institutions of all sizes. Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not
required. The Board invites comment on this matter.

 It is hereby certified that this proposed rule, if adopted as a final rule, will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small savings associations. This proposal provides an alternative means of evaluating
a small savings association's CRA requirements that would enable most such savings associations to avoid the data
collection requirements in 12 CFR Part 563e and will encourage greater small business lending by savings associations
of all sizes.

activities, as measured by home mortgage originations and purchases, small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business and small farm loans outstanding, and community development loans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outstanding. At the bank's option, the lending test will also evaluate the bank's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer loans outstanding and any other loan distribution data the bank may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
choose to provide, such as data on extensions of lines of credit, commitments, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and letters of credit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weigh its assessments of the bank's home mortgage lending, small business and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small farm lending, and (at the bank's option) consumer lending to reflect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relative importance of each category of lending to the bank's overall business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The OCC shall weigh the bank's community development lending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
according to the characteristics and needs of the bank's service area(s), the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capacity and constraints of the bank, and the opportunities available to the bank for this lending.

 (i) A bank shall specify in its plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurable goals for helping to meet the credit needs of each of its service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area(s) covered by the plan, particularly the needs of low- and moderate-income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
geographies and low- and moderate-income individuals, through lending, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investment, and the provision of services, as appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A bank shall address all three performance categories and, unless the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bank has been designated as a wholesale or limited purpose bank, shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emphasize lending and lending-related activities. Nevertheless, a different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emphasis, including a focus on one or more performance categories, may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate if responsive to the characteristics and credit needs of its service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area, considering public comment and the bank's capacity and constraints, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product offerings, and business strategy.

Confidential information.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The bank may submit additional information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the OCC on a confidential basis, but the goals stated in the plan shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficiently specific to enable the public and the OCC to judge fairly the merits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Satisfactory and outstanding goals.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A bank shall specify in its plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurable goals that constitute ``satisfactory'' performance. A plan may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specify measurable goals that constitute ``outstanding'' performance. In order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be considered for an ``outstanding'' performance rating, the bank shall submit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both ``satisfactory'' and ``outstanding'' performance goals.

Timing.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The OCC shall act upon a plan within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
60 days after the complete plan and required accompanying material are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted. If the OCC fails to act within this time period, the plan shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deemed approved unless the OCC extends the review period for good cause. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Public participation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In evaluating the plan's goals, the OCC shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider the public's involvement in formulating the plan, public comment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the plan, and any response by the bank to public comment on the plan.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Criteria for evaluating plan.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The OCC shall evaluate a plan's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurable goals using the following criteria, as appropriate: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The extent and breadth of lending or lending-related activities, including, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as appropriate, the distribution of loans among different geographies, businesses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and farms of different sizes, and individuals of different income levels, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extent of community development lending, and the use of innovative or flexible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lending practices to address credit needs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The amount and innovativeness, complexity, and responsiveness of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bank's qualified investments, as defined in &sect;25.23 of this part; and

Plan amendment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 During the term of a plan, the bank may petition the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OCC to approve an amendment to the plan on grounds that a material change in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances has made the plan no longer appropriate. Any amendment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed shall be developed in accordance with the public participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.

Ratings in general
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Subject to paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, the OCC shall assign to a bank a rating of ``outstanding,''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``satisfactory,'' ``needs to improve,'' or ``substantial noncompliance'' based on the bank's performance under
the lending, investment and service tests, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lending, investment, and service tests
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The OCC shall assign a rating for a bank assessed under the lending, investment, and service tests in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with the procedures provided in Appendix A of this part and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following principles: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A bank's rating on the lending test shall be weighed so as to count for at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least 50 percent of its assigned rating; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A bank that receives an ``outstanding'' rating on the lending test shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receive an assigned rating of at least ``satisfactory''; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A bank that receives an ``outstanding'' rating on the lending test and an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``outstanding'' rating on either the service test or the investment test shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receive an assigned rating of ``outstanding''; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A bank that receives an ``outstanding'' rating on both the service test and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the investment test and a rating of at least ``high satisfactory'' on the lending test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall receive an assigned rating of ``outstanding''; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) No bank may receive an assigned rating of ``satisfactory'' unless it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receives a rating of at least ``low satisfactory'' on the lending test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Effect of evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices shall adversely affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the OCC's evaluation of a bank's performance. In determining the effect on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the bank's assigned rating, the OCC shall consider the nature and extent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence, the policies and procedures that the bank has in place to prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discriminatory or other illegal credit practices, any corrective action that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bank has taken or has committed to take, particularly voluntary corrective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action resulting from self-assessment, and other relevant information, such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the bank's past fair lending performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Effect of successive ``needs to improve'' ratings.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A bank that would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
otherwise receive an assigned rating of ``needs to improve'' shall receive an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assigned rating of ``substantial noncompliance'' if the bank received no better 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than a ``needs to improve'' rating on each of its two previous examinations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Shall include those geographies in the local areas around a bank's

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to its July 1978 proposed regulation, 12 CFR Part 25, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement the CRA, the OCC received several inquiries from institutions that, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
although they are chartered as national banks, do not perform commercial or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retail banking services. These institutions serve solely as correspondent banks, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or as trust companies, or as clearing agents, and they do not extend credit to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the public for their own account. The OCC concludes that the CRA is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended to cover these institutions. It is the purpose of the CRA to require the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OCC to encourage banks to meet the credit needs of their local communities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To this end, the OCC must assess banks' records of performance and take those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records into account in acting on certain applications affecting the banks. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OCC believes that these provisions were intended to cover all banks that are in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the business of extending credit to the public, including both wholesale and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retail banks. The lending activities of these banks affect the economic health of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the communities in which they are chartered. However, the OCC believes it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be pointless to encourage or to assess the credit granting record of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions that are not organized to grant credit to the public in the ordinary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
course of business, other than as an incident to their specialized operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the term national bank as used in this part does not include banks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that engage solely in correspondent banking business, trust company business,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Ratings in general. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) In assigning a rating, the OCC shall evaluate a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bank's performance under the applicable assessment criteria in this part, subject 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to &sect;25.28 of this part, which provides for adjustments on the basis of evidence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices and prior ``needs to improve'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ratings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A bank's performance need not fit each aspect of a particular rating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
profile in order to receive that rating, and exceptionally strong performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with respect to some aspects may compensate for weak performance in others. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The bank's overall performance, however, should generally be consistent with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the appropriate profile stated below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

bank's performance as described below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Eligibility for a satisfactory rating.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The OCC shall rate a bank's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance ``satisfactory'' if, in general, the bank demonstrates: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A reasonable loan-to-deposit ratio (considering seasonal variations) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
given the bank's size, financial condition, the credit needs of its service area(s), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and taking into account, as appropriate, lending-related activities such as loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
originations for sale to the secondary markets and community development 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lending and investment; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A majority of its loans and, as appropriate, other lending-related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities are in its service area(s); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A distribution of loans to and, as appropriate, other lending related-activities for individuals of different
income levels (including low- and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moderate-income individuals) and businesses and farms of different sizes that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable given the demographics of the bank's service area(s); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) A record of taking appropriate action, as warranted, in response to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
written complaints, if any, about the bank's performance in meeting the credit

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Eligibility for an outstanding rating.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 A small bank that meets each of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the standards for a ``satisfactory'' rating under this paragraph and exceeds some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or all of those standards may warrant consideration for an overall rating of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``outstanding''. In assessing whether a small bank's performance is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``outstanding'', the OCC shall consider the extent to which the bank exceeds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each of the assessment standards for a ``satisfactory'' rating and its performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in making qualified investments (as defined in &sect;25.23 of this part) and its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance in providing branches, ATMs or other services and delivery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems that enhance credit availability in its service area(s).

Needs to improve or substantial noncompliance ratings.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 A small bank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also may receive a rating of ``needs to improve'' or ``substantial noncompliance'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
depending on the degree to which its performance has failed to meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards for a ``satisfactory'' rating.

Strategic plan assessment and rating.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Satisfactory goals.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The OCC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall approve as ``satisfactory'' measurable goals that adequately help meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit needs of each of a bank's service area(s). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Outstanding goals.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the plan identifies a separate group of measurable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
goals that substantially exceed the levels approved as ``satisfactory,'' the OCC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall approve those goals as ``outstanding.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Rating.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The OCC shall assess the performance of a bank operating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under an approved plan to determine if the bank has met its plan goals: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If the bank substantially achieves its plan goals for a satisfactory rating, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the OCC shall rate the bank's performance under the plan as ``satisfactory.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the bank exceeds its plan goals for a satisfactory rating and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantially achieves its plan goals for an outstanding rating, the OCC shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate the bank's performance under the plan as ``outstanding''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If the bank fails to substantially meet its plan goals for a satisfactory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rating, it shall be rated as either ``needs to improve'' or ``substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance,'' depending on the extent to which it falls short of its plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
goals, or if the bank so elected at the time it first submitted its plan, it shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rated under the lending, investment and service tests (as described in &sect;&sect;25.22 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through 25.24 of this part), the community development test (as described in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;25.25 of this part), or the small bank assessment standards (as described in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;25.26 of this part), as appropriate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This form contains the instructions for completion of the Loan Register for Small Business and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Small Farm Loans. This register is used in conjunction with the reporting of this information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as part of the CRA data collection process. The register and these instructions are to be used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to provide the format in which the data should be reported. The actual data are to be submitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in machine-readable form in accordance with the instructions for submission of data pursuant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to 12 CFR Part 203 (Regulation C). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

I. Who Must File a Register 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
All independent insured banks and thrifts with $250 million or more in total assets and all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insured banks and thrifts that are members of holding companies with $250 million or more in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bank and thrift assets must report this information for small business and small farm loans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outstanding beginning December 31, 1995. Banks and thrifts with fewer assets that wish to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluated under 12 CFR &sect;&sect;25.22 through 25.24 must also report this information. Only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide information on business or farm location and borrower information for loans for which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications were submitted after July 1, 1995. For loans for which applications were submitted before that date,
enter ``N/A'' for all information relating to location 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or borrower. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Types of Loans to be Reported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The loan register should contain individual loan data on each small business or small farm loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as defined on schedule RC-C of the December 31 Report of Condition and Income. Include data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on individual small business loans with original loan amounts of $1 million or less and individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small farm loans with original loan amounts of $500,000 or less that had an outstanding balance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as of December 31. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Submission of Data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The data must be submitted in machine-readable form consistent with requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submission of data pursuant to 12 CFR Part 203 (Regulation C). The format must conform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exactly to the form, including the order of columns, column headings, etc. Contact your federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supervisory agency for information regarding procedures and technical specifications for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
automated data submission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Your institution should decide on the procedure it wants to follow for collection of the data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the Supplemental Instructions For Collection Of Data In Connection with Small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Business and Small Farm Loans. Keep in mind that data reported on the register are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outstandings as of December 31 and not originations as are reported for some other regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes. Your institution may collect the data on separate registers at different branches or on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate registers for different loan types (small business or small farm), but make sure each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loan number is unique. Entries need not be grouped on your registers by MSA, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chronologically, or by census tract, or in any other particular order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
Loan Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Loan Number_Enter an identifying number that can be used to retrieve the loan file. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It can be any number (not exceeding 25 characters). Use letters, numerals, or a combination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of both. Make sure that all numbers are unique within the institution. If registers contains data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for branch offices, for example, use a letter or a numerical code to identify the loans of different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
branches or assign a certain series of numbers to particular branches to avoid duplicate numbers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of the borrower's tax-payer identification number or social security number is strongly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discouraged for privacy reasons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Outstanding Loan Amount_Enter the outstanding loan amount (balance) as of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
December 31. Show the amount in thousands rounding to the nearest thousand. Do not report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loans with balances below $500. For example, a loan with a balance of $500 would be rounded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to $1,000; a loan balance of $50,300 would be rounded to $50,000; and a balance of $15,700 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be rounded to $16,000.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 will be applied (as indicated by borrower) are located; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Small farm loans are located in the census tract or block numbering area where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 the farm or other property to which the loan proceeds will be applied (as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 indicated by borrower) is located. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. MSA_For each loan in a MSA, indicate the location of the loan by the four digit MSA

effect on January 1 of the calendar year for which you are reporting. A listing of MSAs is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available from your regional supervisory agency. (In these instructions, the term MSA refers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MSAs, enter ``N/A''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. State &amp; County_Use the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) two-digit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numerical code for the state and the three-digit numerical code for the county. These codes are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available from your regional supervisory agency. Do not use the letter abbreviations used by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the United States Postal Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Census Tract/Block Numbering Area_Enter the census tract number or block 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Supplemental Instructions for Collection of Data in Connection With Small

Business and Small Farm Loans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Format 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Beginning July 1, 1995, financial institutions required to report small business and small farm 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loan registers are to collect information on the racial, ethnic, and gender make-up of applicants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or borrowers in connection with small business and small farm loans. If you take a written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application, you should list questions regarding the percent of minority and gender ownership 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on your loan application form or on a separate form completed by the applicant in conjunction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with an application. If you do not take a written application, you should request the information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at an appropriate time during the application or origination process; you must request the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information for each loan you originate even if you did not take a written application. If you 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neither take a written application nor originate the loan, you do not have to request the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information. See the sample form for recommended format and language. This information is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be maintained in the institution's in-house loan files. This information is not to be reported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the agency, but is to be used to complete the small business and small farm loan register. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. You must ask for this information, but cannot require the applicant or borrower to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide it. You may not consider whether or not an applicant or borrower has provided this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information in making your decision whether to extend credit or in setting the terms of credit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. If the applicant or borrower chooses not to provide the information, note this fact on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Inform the applicant or borrower that the Federal government is requesting this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information in order to monitor compliance with Federal statutes that prohibit lenders from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discriminating on these bases.

Instructions for Completion of the Open- and Closed-End Consumer Loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Registers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This form contains the instructions for completion of the Loan Registers for Open-End 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consumer Loans and Closed-End Consumer Loans. These registers are used in conjunction with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the collection of this information as part of the CRA data collection process. The registers and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these instructions are to be used to provide the format in which the data should be maintained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data must be maintained in machine-readable form. If you wish to maintain the data in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative format, you must obtain approval from your primary supervisory agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Who May Maintain a Register 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Any insured bank or thrift may, at the institution's option, collect and maintain this information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for loans outstanding beginning December 31, 1995. You need only provide information on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower location and gross annual income for loans for which applications were submitted after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
July 1, 1995. For loans for which applications were submitted before that date, you may enter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``N/A'' for borrower location and gross annual income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Types of Loans To Be Recorded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
If you collect and maintain information on your consumer loans for consideration in your CRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation, you must provide data on all consumer loans outstanding included in the aggregate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer loan figure on your December 31 Report of Condition and Income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Your institution should decide on the procedure it wants to follow for collection of the data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Keep in mind that data recorded on the registers are outstandings as of December 31 and not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
originations as are reported for some other regulatory purposes. Your institution may collect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the data on separate registers at different branches, but is required to maintain the data on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate registers for each of the different consumer loan types (open-end and closed-end). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Make sure the loan numbers are unique. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Instructions for Completion of Register 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
Loan Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. LOAN NUMBER_Enter an identifying number that can be used to retrieve the loan file. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It can be any number (not exceeding 25 characters). Use letters, numerals, or a combination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of both. Make sure that all numbers are unique within the institution. If registers contains data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for branch offices, for example, use a letter or a numerical code to identify the loans of different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
branches or assign a certain series of numbers to particular branches to avoid duplicate numbers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of the borrower's tax-payer identification number or social security number is strongly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discouraged for privacy reasons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. OUTSTANDING LOAN AMOUNT_Enter the outstanding loan amount (balance) as of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
December 31. Show the amount in thousands rounding to the nearest thousand. Do not report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loans with balances below $500. For example, a loan with a balance of $500 would be rounded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to $1,000; a loan balance of $50,300 would be rounded to $50,000; and a balance of $15,700 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be rounded to $16,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Borrower Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

1. MSA_For each loan in a MSA, indicate the location of the loan by the four digit MSA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number. Enter only the MSA number, not the MSA name. Use MSA boundaries that were in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available from your regional supervisory agency. (In these instructions, the term MSA refers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to metropolitan statistical area or primary metropolitan statistical area.) For loans outside 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MSAs, enter ``N/A''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numerical code for the state and the three-digit numerical code for the county. These codes are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available from your regional supervisory agency. Do not use the letter abbreviations used by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numbering area from the U.S. Census Bureau's Census Tract/Street Index for the most recent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
census reporting period. For addresses not listed in the index, consult the Census Bureau's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
census tract outline maps. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. GROSS ANNUAL INCOME_Enter the gross annual income upon which your institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

wholesale or limited purpose bank (as defined in &sect;228.12 of this part) is helping to meet the credit needs of its
service area(s) under the community development test only if the bank's written request to be designated as a wholesale
or limited purpose bank has been approved by the Board before the commencement of its CRA examination, and the designation
has not been revoked either at the request of the bank or at the Board's own initiative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

or community development services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (3) For purposes of the community development test only, community development loans include small business and

Alternative election. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A bank may request to be rated under a strategic plan rather than under the lending, service, and investment tests (&sect;&sect;228.22
through 228.24 of this part), the community development test (&sect;228.25 of this part), or the small bank assessment
standards (&sect;228.26 of this part), by submitting to the Board a strategic plan as provided for in this section.
A bank's request to be rated under a strategic plan is not approved until the Board approves the plan. The Board's approval
of a strategic plan does not affect the bank's obligation, if any, to report data as required by &sect;228.42 of this
part.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) A plan may have a term of no more than five years, and any multi-year plan shall include annual interim measurable
goals according to which the Board shall evaluate the bank's performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A bank with more than one service area may prepare a single plan for all of its service areas or a plan for one or more
but not all of its service areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Affiliated institutions may prepare joint plans if the plans provide measurable goals for each institution.

Before submitting a plan to the Board for approval, the bank shall: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Informally seek suggestions from the public in its service area(s) while developing the plan; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Once the bank has developed a plan, formally solicit public comment on the plan for at least 30 days by publishing
notice in a newspaper of general circulation in each of its service areas; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) During the period of formal public comment, make copies of the plan available for review at all offices of the bank

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) A bank shall specify in its plan measurable goals for helping to meet the credit needs of each of its service area(s)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A bank shall address all three performance categories and, unless 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the bank has been designated as a wholesale or limited purpose bank, shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emphasize lending and lending-related activities. Nevertheless, a different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emphasis, including a focus on one or more performance categories, may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate if responsive to the characteristics and credit needs of its service area, considering public comment
and the bank's capacity and constraints, product offerings, and business strategy.

A bank shall specify in its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan measurable goals that constitute ``satisfactory'' performance. A plan may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specify measurable goals that constitute ``outstanding'' performance. In order to be considered for an ``outstanding''
performance rating, the bank shall submit both ``satisfactory'' and ``outstanding'' performance goals.

Ratings in general. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subject to paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section, the Board shall assign to a bank a rating of ``outstanding,'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``satisfactory,'' ``needs to improve,'' or ``substantial noncompliance'' based on the bank's performance under
the lending, investment and service tests, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community development test, the small bank assessment standards, or an approved strategic plan, as applicable.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lending, investment, and service tests. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board shall assign a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rating for a bank assessed under the lending, investment, and service tests in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with the procedures provided in Appendix A of this part and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following principles: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A bank's rating on the lending test shall be weighed so as to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
count for at least 50 percent of its assigned rating; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A bank that receives an ``outstanding'' rating on the lending test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall receive an assigned rating of at least ``satisfactory''; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A bank that receives an ``outstanding'' rating on the lending test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and an ``outstanding'' rating on either the service test or the investment test shall receive an assigned rating of
``outstanding''; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A bank that receives an ``outstanding'' rating on both the service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test and the investment test and a rating of at least ``high satisfactory'' on the lending test shall receive an assigned
rating of ``outstanding''; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) No bank may receive an assigned rating of ``satisfactory'' unless 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it receives a rating of at least ``low satisfactory'' on the lending test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Effect of evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practices. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices shall adversely affect the Board's evaluation of a
bank's performance. In determining the effect on the bank's assigned rating, the Board shall consider the nature
and extent of the evidence, the policies and procedures that the bank has in place to prevent discriminatory or other
illegal credit practices, any corrective action that the bank has taken or has committed to take, particularly voluntary
corrective action resulting from self-assessment, and other relevant information, such as the bank's past fair
lending performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Effect of successive ``needs to improve'' ratings. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A bank that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would otherwise receive an assigned rating of ``needs to improve'' shall receive an assigned rating of ``substantial
noncompliance'' if the bank received no better than a ``needs to improve'' rating on each of its two previous examinations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to its July 1978 proposed regulation, 12 CFR Part 228, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to implement the CRA, the Board received several inquiries from institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that, although they are chartered as banks, do not perform commercial or retail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
banking services. These institutions serve solely as correspondent banks, or as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trust companies, or as clearing agents, and they do not extend credit to the public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for their own account. The Board concludes that the CRA is not intended to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cover these institutions. It is the purpose of the CRA to require the Board to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
encourage banks to meet the credit needs of their local communities. To this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
end, the Board must assess banks' records of performance and take those records 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into account in acting on certain applications affecting the banks. The Board 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that these provisions were intended to cover all banks that are in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business of extending credit to the public, including both wholesale and retail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
banks. The lending activities of these banks affect the economic health of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
communities in which they are chartered. However, the Board believes it would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be pointless to encourage or to assess the credit-granting record of institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are not organized to grant credit to the public in the ordinary course of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business, other than as an incident to their specialized operations. Accordingly, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
State member bank 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
as used in this part does not include banks that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engage solely in correspondent banking business, trust company business, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acting as a clearing agent.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Ratings in general.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) In assigning a rating, the Board shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluate a bank's performance under the applicable assessment criteria in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part, subject to &sect;228.28 of this part, which provides for adjustments on the basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices and prior ``needs to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improve'' ratings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A bank's performance need not fit each aspect of a particular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rating profile in order to receive that rating, and exceptionally strong 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance with respect to some aspects may compensate for weak performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in others. The bank's overall performance, however, should generally be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the appropriate profile stated below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->

(A) Excellent responsiveness to credit needs in its service area(s); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) An excellent geographic distribution of loans throughout its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) An excellent distribution, particularly in its service area(s), of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loans among individuals of different income levels and businesses (including

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) An excellent record of serving the credit needs of the most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economically disadvantaged areas of its service area(s), low-income individuals, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(F) Extensive use of innovative or flexible lending practices to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
address the credit needs of low- or moderate-income individuals or geographies; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(G) It is a leader in making community development loans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
High satisfactory. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board shall rate a bank's lending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance ``high satisfactory'' if, in general, it demonstrates: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Good responsiveness to credit needs in its service area(s);

Low satisfactory
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A reasonable loan-to-deposit ratio (considering seasonal

Eligibility for an outstanding rating.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 A small bank that meets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each of the standards for a ``satisfactory'' rating under this paragraph and exceeds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some or all of those standards may warrant consideration for an overall rating of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``outstanding''. In assessing whether a small bank's performance is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``outstanding'', the Board shall consider the extent to which the bank exceeds each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the assessment standards for a ``satisfactory'' rating and its performance in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
making qualified investments (as defined in &sect;228.23 of this part) and its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance in providing branches, ATMs or other services and delivery systems

 A small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bank also may receive a rating of ``needs to improve'' or ``substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance'' depending on the degree to which its performance has failed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meet the standards for a ``satisfactory'' rating.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Board shall approve as ``satisfactory''

measurable goals that adequately help meet the credit needs of each of a bank's service area(s). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Outstanding goals.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the plan identifies a separate group of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurable goals that substantially exceed the levels approved as ``satisfactory,'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Board shall approve those goals as ``outstanding.''

Rating.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Board shall assess the performance of a bank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operating under an approved plan to determine if the bank has met its plan goals: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If the bank substantially achieves its plan goals for a satisfactory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rating, the Board shall rate the bank's performance under the plan as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``satisfactory.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the bank exceeds its plan goals for a satisfactory rating and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantially achieves its plan goals for an outstanding rating, the Board shall rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the bank's performance under the plan as ``outstanding''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If the bank fails to substantially meet its plan goals for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfactory rating, it shall be rated as either ``needs to improve'' or ``substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance,'' depending on the extent to which it falls short of its plan goals, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or if the bank so elected at the time it first submitted its plan, it shall be rated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the lending, investment and service tests (as described in &sect;&sect;228.22 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through 228.24 of this part), the community development test (as described in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;228.25 of this part), or the small bank assessment standards (as described in

Instructions for the Small Business and Small Farm Loan Register 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This form contains the instructions for completion of the Loan Register for Small Business and Small Farm Loans. This
register is used in conjunction with the reporting of this information as part of the CRA data collection process.
The register and these instructions are to be used to provide the format in which the data should be reported. The actual
data are to be submitted in machine-readable form in accordance with the instructions for submission of data pursuant
to 12 CFR Part 203 (Regulation C). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Who Must File a Register 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
All independent insured banks and thrifts with $250 million or more in total assets and all insured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
banks and thrifts that are members of holding companies with $250 million or more in bank and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thrift assets must report this information for small business and small farm loans outstanding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beginning December 31, 1995. Banks and thrifts with fewer assets that wish to be evaluated under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12 CFR 228.22 through 228.24 must also report this information. Only provide information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on business or farm location and borrower information for loans for which applications were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted after July 1, 1995. For loans for which applications were submitted before that date, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enter ``N/A'' for all information relating to location or borrower. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Types of Loans To Be Reported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The loan register should contain individual loan data on each small business or small farm loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as defined on schedule RC-C of the December 31 Report of Condition and Income. Include data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on individual small business loans with original loan amounts of $1 million or less and individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small farm loans with original loan amounts of $500,000 or less that had an outstanding balance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as of December 31. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Submission of Data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The data must be submitted in machine-readable form consistent with requirements for submission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of data pursuant to 12 CFR Part 203 (Regulation C). The format must conform exactly to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
form, including the order of columns, column headings, etc. Contact your federal supervisory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency for information regarding procedures and technical specifications for automated data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Your institution should decide on the procedure it wants to follow for collection of the data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the Supplemental Instructions For Collection Of Data In Connection with Small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Business and Small Farm Loans. Keep in mind that data reported on the register are outstanding as of December 31 and
not originations as are reported for some other regulatory purposes. Your 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution may collect the data on separate registers at different branches or on separate registers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for different loan types (small business or small farm), but make sure each loan number is unique. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Entries need not be grouped on your registers by MSA, or chronologically, or by census tract, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in any other particular order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
LOAN NUMBER_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Enter an identifying number that can be used to retrieve the loan file. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It can be any number (not exceeding 25 characters). Use letters, numerals, or a combination of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both. Make sure that all numbers are unique within the institution. If registers contain data for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
branch offices, for example, use a letter or a numerical code to identify the loans of different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
branches or assign a certain series of numbers to particular branches to avoid duplicate numbers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of the borrower's tax-payer identification number or social security number is strongly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discouraged for privacy reasons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
December 31. Show the amount in thousands rounding to the nearest thousand. Do not report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loans with balances below $500. For example, a loan with a balance of $500 would be rounded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to $1,000; a loan balance of $50,300 would be rounded to $50,000; and a balance of $15,700 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be rounded to $16,000.

Supplemental instructions for collection of data in connection with small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business and small farm loans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Format 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Beginning July 1, 1995, financial institutions required to report small business and small farm loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registers are to collect information on the racial, ethnic, and gender make-up of applicants or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrowers in connection with small business and small farm loans. If you take a written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application, you should list questions regarding the percent of minority and gender ownership on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
your loan application form or on a separate form completed by the applicant in conjunction with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an application. If you do not take a written application, you should request the information at an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate time during the application or origination process; you must request the information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for each loan you originate even if you did not take a written application. If you neither take a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
written application nor originate the loan, you do not have to request the information. See the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sample form for recommended format and language. This information is to be maintained in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution's in-house loan files. This information is not to be reported to the agency, but is to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to complete the small business and small farm loan register. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. You must ask for this information, but cannot require the applicant or borrower to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it. You may not consider whether or not an applicant or borrower has provided this information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in making your decision whether to extend credit or in setting the terms of credit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. If the applicant or borrower chooses not to provide the information, note this fact on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Inform the applicant or borrower that the Federal government is requesting this information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in order to monitor compliance with Federal statutes that prohibit lenders from discriminating on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these bases.

Instructions for completion of the open- and closed-end consumer loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This form contains the instructions for completion of the Loan Registers for Open-End 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consumer Loans and Closed-End Consumer Loans. These registers are used in conjunction with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the collection of this information as part of the CRA data collection process. The registers and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these instructions are to be used to provide the format in which the data should be maintained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data must be maintained in machine-readable form. If you wish to maintain the data in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative format, you must obtain approval from your primary supervisory agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Who May Maintain a Register 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Any insured bank or thrift may, at the institution's option, collect and maintain this information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for loans outstanding beginning December 31, 1995. You need only provide information on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower location and gross annual income for loans for which applications were submitted after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
July 1, 1995. For loans for which applications were submitted before that date, you may enter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``N/A'' for borrower location and gross annual income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Types of Loans to be Recorded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
If you collect and maintain information on your consumer loans for consideration in your CRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation, you must provide data on all consumer loans outstanding included in the aggregate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer loan figure on your December 31 Report of Condition and Income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Your institution should decide on the procedure it wants to follow for collection of the data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Keep in mind that data recorded on the registers are outstandings as of December 31 and not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
originations as are reported for some other regulatory purposes. Your institution may collect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the data on separate registers at different branches, but is required to maintain the data on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate registers for each of the different consumer loan types (open-end and closed-end). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Make sure the loan numbers are unique. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Instructions for Completion of Register 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
Loan Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
LOAN NUMBER_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Enter an identifying number that can be used to retrieve the loan file. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It can be any number (not exceeding 25 characters). Use letters, numerals, or a combination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of both. Make sure that all numbers are unique within the institution. If registers contains data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for branch offices, for example, use a letter or a numerical code to identify the loans of different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
branches or assign a certain series of numbers to particular branches to avoid duplicate numbers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of the borrower's tax-payer identification number or social security number is strongly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discouraged for privacy reasons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
OUTSTANDING LOAN AMOUNT_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Enter the outstanding loan amount (balance) as of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
December 31. Show the amount in thousands rounding to the nearest thousand. Do not report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loans with balances below $500. For example, a loan with a balance of $500 would be rounded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to $1,000; a loan balance of $50,300 would be rounded to $50,000; and a balance of $15,700 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be rounded to $16,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
Borrower Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
For each loan, identify the location of the borrower. Consumer loans are located in the census 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tract or block numbering area where the borrower resides. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
MSA_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
For each loan in a MSA, indicate the location of the loan by the four digit MSA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number. Enter only the MSA number, not the MSA name. Use MSA boundaries that were in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect on January 1 of the calendar year for which you are reporting. A listing of MSAs is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available from your regional supervisory agency. (In these instructions, the term MSA refers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to metropolitan statistical area or primary metropolitan statistical area.) For loans outside 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MSAs, enter ``N/A''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Use the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) two-digit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numerical code for the state and the three-digit numerical code for the county. These codes are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available from your regional supervisory agency. Do not use the letter abbreviations used by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the United States Postal Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Enter the census tract number or block 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numbering area from the U.S. Census Bureau's Census Tract/Street Index for the most recent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
census reporting period. For addresses not listed in the index, consult the Census Bureau's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
census tract outline maps. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
GROSS ANNUAL INCOME_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

 (1) The lending test evaluates a bank's performance in helping to meet the credit needs of its service area(s) through
its lending activities, as measured by home mortgage originations and purchases, small business and small farm loans
outstanding, and community development loans outstanding. At the bank's option, the lending test will also evaluate
the bank's consumer loans outstanding and any other loan distribution data the bank may choose to provide, such as
data on extensions of lines of credit, commitments, and letters of credit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When evaluating a bank's overall lending performance, the FDIC shall weigh its assessments of the bank's home
mortgage lending, small business and small farm lending, and (at the bank's option) consumer lending to reflect the
relative importance of each category of lending to the bank's overall business.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The FDIC shall weigh the bank's community development lending according to the characteristics and needs of the

individuals, through lending, investment, and the provision of services, as appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A bank shall address all three performance categories and, unless the bank has been designated as a wholesale
or limited purpose bank, shall emphasize lending and lending-related activities. Nevertheless, a different emphasis,
including a focus on one or more performance categories, may be appropriate if responsive to the characteristics
and credit needs of its service area, considering public comment and the bank's capacity and constraints, product
offerings, and business strategy.

The FDIC shall assign a rating for a bank assessed under the lending, investment, and service tests in accordance with
the procedures provided in Appendix A of this part and the following principles:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A bank's rating on the lending test shall be weighed so as to count for at least 50 percent of its assigned rating;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A bank that receives an ``outstanding'' rating on the lending test shall receive an assigned rating of at least
``satisfactory'';
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A bank that receives an ``outstanding'' rating on the lending test and an ``outstanding'' rating on either the
service test or the investment test shall receive an assigned rating of ``outstanding'';
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A bank that receives an ``outstanding'' rating on both the service test and the investment test and a rating of at
least ``high satisfactory'' on the lending test shall receive an assigned rating of ``outstanding''; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices shall adversely affect the FDIC's evaluation of a bank's
performance. In determining the effect on the bank's assigned rating, the FDIC shall consider the nature and extent
of the evidence, the policies and procedures that the bank has in place to prevent discriminatory or other illegal
credit practices, any corrective action that the bank has taken or has committed to take, particularly voluntary
corrective action resulting from self-assessment, and other relevant information, such as the bank's past fair

provided that the service area(s): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Do(es) not reflect illegal discrimination; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Do(es) not arbitrarily exclude low- and moderate-income geographies, taking into account the bank's size and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Shall include those geographies in the local areas around a bank's branches and deposit-taking RSFs in which the
bank has originated or had outstanding, during the previous calendar year, a significant number and amount of home
mortgage, small business and small farm, and (if the bank chooses to have them considered in its CRA evaluation) consumer
loans and any other geographies equidistant from its branches and deposit-taking RSFs, taking into account political
boundaries or significant geographic barriers; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Shall not extend substantially across MSA boundaries or state boundaries unless the service area is located in
a multistate MSA. If the bank serves areas that extend substantially across state boundaries or extend substantially
across boundaries of an MSA, the bank shall delineate separate service areas for the areas in each state and for the
areas inside and outside the MSA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to its July 1978 proposed regulation, 12 CFR Part 345, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement the CRA, the FDIC received several inquiries from institutions that, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
although they were chartered as banks, did not perform commercial or retail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
banking services. These institutions served solely as correspondent banks, or as trust companies, or as clearing
agents, and they did not extend credit to the public for their own account. The FDIC concludes that the CRA is not intended
to cover these institutions. It is the purpose of the CRA to require the FDIC to encourage banks to meet the credit needs
of their local communities. To this end the FDIC must assess banks' records of performance and take those records into
account in acting on certain applications affecting the banks. The FDIC believes that these provisions were intended
to cover all banks that are in the business of extending credit to the public including both 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
wholesale
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
retail
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 banks. The lending activities of these banks affect the economic health of the communities in which they are chartered.
However, the FDIC believes it would be pointless to encourage or to assess the credit granting record of institutions
that are not organized to grant credit to the public in the ordinary course of business, other than as an incident to
their specialized operations. Accordingly the term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
bank
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

part, subject to &sect;345.28 of this part, which provides for adjustments on the

Eligibility for a satisfactory rating.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The FDIC shall rate a bank's performance ``satisfactory'' if, in general, the bank demonstrates: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A reasonable loan-to-deposit ratio (considering seasonal variations) given the bank's size, financial condition,
the credit needs of its service area(s), and taking into account, as appropriate, lending-related activities such
as loan originations for sale to the secondary markets and community development lending and investment; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A majority of its loans and, as appropriate, other lending- related activities are in its service area(s); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A distribution of loans to and, as appropriate, other lending related-activities for individuals of different
income levels (including low- and moderate-income individuals) and businesses and farms of different sizes that
is reasonable given the demographics of the bank's service area(s); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) A record of taking appropriate action, as warranted, in response to written complaints, if any, about the bank's
performance in meeting the credit needs of its service area(s); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) A reasonable geographic distribution of loans given its service area(s).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Eligibility for an outstanding rating.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 A small bank that meets each of the standards for a ``satisfactory'' rating under this paragraph and exceeds some or
all of those standards may warrant consideration for an overall rating of ``outstanding''. In assessing whether
a small bank's performance is ``outstanding'', the FDIC shall consider the extent to which the bank exceeds each of
the assessment standards for a ``satisfactory'' rating and its performance in making qualified investments (as
defined in &sect;345.23 of this part) and its performance in providing branches, RSFs or other services and delivery
systems that enhance credit availability in its service area(s).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Needs to improve or substantial noncompliance ratings.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 A small bank also may receive a rating of ``needs to improve'' or ``substantial noncompliance'' depending on the degree
to which its performance has failed to meet the standards for a ``satisfactory'' rating.

Satisfactory goals.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The FDIC shall approve as ``satisfactory'' measurable goals that adequately help meet the credit needs of each of
a bank's service area(s). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Outstanding goals.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the plan identifies a separate group of measurable goals that substantially exceed the levels approved as ``satisfactory,''
the FDIC shall approve those goals as ``outstanding.''

(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Rating.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The FDIC shall assess the performance of a bank operating under an approved plan to determine if the bank has met its
plan goals: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If the bank substantially achieves its plan goals for a satisfactory rating, the FDIC shall rate the bank's performance
under the plan as ``satisfactory.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the bank exceeds its plan goals for a satisfactory rating and substantially achieves its plan goals for an outstanding
rating, the FDIC shall rate the bank's performance under the plan as ``outstanding''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If the bank fails to substantially meet its plan goals for a satisfactory rating, it shall be rated as either ``needs
to improve'' or ``substantial noncompliance,'' depending on the extent to which it falls short of its plan goals,
or if the bank so elected at the time it first submitted its plan, it shall be rated under the lending, investment and
service tests (as described in &sect;&sect;345.22 through 345.24 of this part), the community development test
(as described in &sect;345.25 of this part), or the small bank assessment standards (as described in &sect;345.26
of this part), as appropriate.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This form contains the instructions for completion of the Loan Register for Small Business and Small Farm Loans. This
register is used in conjunction with the reporting of this information as part of the CRA data collection process.
The register and these instructions are to be used to provide the format in which the data should be reported. The actual
data are to be submitted in machine-readable form in accordance with the instructions for submission of data pursuant
to 12 CFR Part 203 (Regulation C).

I. Who Must File a Register
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
All independent insured banks and thrifts with $250 million or more in total assets and all insured banks and thrifts
that are members of holding companies with $250 million or more in bank and thrift assets must report this information
for small business and small farm loans outstanding beginning December 31, 1995. Banks and thrifts with fewer assets
that wish to be evaluated under 12 CFR &sect;&sect;345.22 through 345.24 must also report this information. Only
provide information on business or farm location and borrower information for loans for which applications were
submitted after July 1, 1995. For loans for which applications were submitted before that date, enter ``N/A'' for
all information relating to location or borrower.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Types of Loans to be Reported
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The loan register should contain individual loan data on each small business or small farm loan as defined on schedule
RC-C of the December 31 Report of Condition and Income. Include data on individual small business loans with original
loan amounts of $1 million or less and individual small farm loans with original loan amounts of $500,000 or less that
had an outstanding balance as of December 31.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Submission of Data
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The data must be submitted in machine-readable form consistent with requirements for submission of data pursuant
to 12 CFR Part 203 (Regulation C). The format must conform exactly to the form, including the order of columns, column
headings, etc. Contact your federal supervisory agency for information regarding procedures and technical specifications
for automated data submission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Your institution should decide on the procedure it wants to follow for collection of the data consistent with the Supplemental
Instructions For Collection Of Data In Connection with Small Business and Small Farm Loans. Keep in mind that data
reported on the register are outstandings as of December 31 and not originations as are reported for some other regulatory
purposes. Your institution may collect the data on separate registers at different branches or on separate registers
for different loan types (small business or small farm), but make sure each loan number is unique. Entries need not
be grouped on your registers by MSA, or chronologically, or by census tract, or in any other particular order.

1. Loan Number_Enter an identifying number that can be used to retrieve the loan file. It can be any number (not exceeding
25 characters). Use letters, numerals, or a combination of both. Make sure that all numbers are unique within the institution.
If registers contains data for branch offices, for example, use a letter or a numerical code to identify the loans of
different branches or assign a certain series of numbers to particular branches to avoid duplicate numbers. The use
of the borrower's tax-payer identification number or social security number is strongly discouraged for privacy
reasons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

2. Outstanding Loan Amount_Enter the outstanding loan amount (balance) as of December 31. Show the amount in thousands
rounding to the nearest thousand. Do not report loans with balances below $500. For example, a loan with a balance of
$500 would be rounded to $1,000; a loan balance of $50,300 would be rounded to $50,000; and a balance of $15,700 would
be rounded to $16,000.

Business and Small Farm Loans

A. Format 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Beginning July 1, 1995, financial institutions required to report small business and small farm 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loan registers are to collect information on the racial, ethnic, and gender make-up of applicants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or borrowers in connection with small business and small farm loans. If you take a written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application, you should list questions regarding the percent of minority and gender ownership 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on your loan application form or on a separate form completed by the applicant in conjunction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with an application. If you do not take a written application, you should request the information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at an appropriate time during the application or origination process; you must request the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information for each loan you originate even if you did not take a written application. If you 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neither take a written application nor originate the loan, you do not have to request the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information. See the sample form for recommended format and language. This information is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be maintained in the institution's in-house loan files. This information is not to be reported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the agency, but is to be used to complete the small business and small farm loan register. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. You must ask for this information, but cannot require the applicant or borrower to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide it. You may not consider whether or not an applicant or borrower has provided this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information in making your decision whether to extend credit or in setting the terms of credit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. If the applicant or borrower chooses not to provide the information, note this fact on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Inform the applicant or borrower that the Federal government is requesting this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information in order to monitor compliance with Federal statutes that prohibit lenders from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discriminating on these bases.

Instructions for Completion of the Open- and Closed-end Consumer Loan Registers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This form contains the instructions for completion of the Loan Registers for Open-End Consumer Loans and Closed-End
Consumer Loans. These registers are used in conjunction with the collection of this information as part of the CRA
data collection process. The registers and these instructions are to be used to provide the format in which the data
should be maintained. The data must be maintained in machine-readable form. If you wish to maintain the data in an alternative
format, you must obtain approval from your primary supervisory agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Who May Maintain a Register
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Any insured bank or thrift may, at the institution's option, collect and maintain this information for loans outstanding
beginning December 31, 1995. You need only provide information on borrower location and gross annual income for loans
for which applications were submitted after July 1, 1995. For loans for which applications were submitted before
that date, you may enter ``N/A'' for borrower location and gross annual income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Types of Loans to be Recorded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
If you collect and maintain information on your consumer loans for consideration in your CRA evaluation, you must
provide data on all consumer loans outstanding included in the aggregate consumer loan figure on your December 31
Report of Condition and Income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Your institution should decide on the procedure it wants to follow for collection of the data. Keep in mind that data
recorded on the registers are outstandings as of December 31 and not originations as are reported for some other regulatory
purposes. Your institution may collect the data on separate registers at different branches, but is required to maintain
the data on separate registers for each of the different consumer loan types (open-end and closed-end). Make sure
the loan numbers are unique. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Loan Number_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Enter an identifying number that can be used to retrieve the loan file. It can be any number (not exceeding 25 characters).
Use letters, numerals, or a combination of both. Make sure that all numbers are unique within the institution. If registers
contains data for branch offices, for example, use a letter or a numerical code to identify the loans of different branches
or assign a certain series of numbers to particular branches to avoid duplicate numbers. The use of the borrower's
tax-payer identification number or social security number is strongly discouraged for privacy reasons.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Outstanding Loan Amount
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
_Enter the outstanding loan amount (balance) as of December 31. Show the amount in thousands rounding to the nearest
thousand. Do not report loans with balances below $500. For example, a loan with a balance of $500 would be rounded to
$1,000; a loan balance of $50,300 would be rounded to $50,000; and a balance of $15,700 would be rounded to $16,000.

MSA
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
_For each loan in a MSA, indicate the location of the loan by the four digit MSA number. Enter only the MSA number, not
the MSA name. Use MSA boundaries that were in effect on January 1 of the calendar year for which you are reporting. A listing
of MSAs is available from your regional supervisory agency. (In these instructions, the term MSA refers to metropolitan
statistical area or primary metropolitan statistical area.) For loans outside MSAs, enter ``N/A''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->

originations for sale to the secondary markets or community development 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lending or investment; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (2) The percentage of loans and, as appropriate, other lending-related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

engaging in other lending-related activities for, borrowers of different income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels and businesses and farms of different sizes; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (4) The geographic distribution of the savings association's loans given its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Alternative election. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A savings association may request to be rated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under a strategic plan rather than under the lending, service, and investment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tests (&sect;&sect;563e.22 through 563e.24 of this part), the community development test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(&sect;563e.25 of this part), or the small savings association assessment standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(&sect;563e.26 of this part), by submitting to the OTS a strategic plan as provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for in this section. A savings association's request to be rated under a strategic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan is not approved until the OTS approves the plan. The OTS's approval of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strategic plan does not affect the savings association's obligation, if any, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report data as required by &sect;Part 563e.42 of this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Strategic plans in general. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) A plan may have a term of no more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than five years, and any multi-year plan shall include annual interim measurable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
goals according to which the OTS shall evaluate the savings association's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (2) A savings association with more than one service area may prepare a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
single plan for all of its service areas or a plan for one or more but not all of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its service areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (3) Affiliated institutions may prepare joint plans if the plans provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurable goals for each institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Public participation in strategic plan development. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before submitting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a plan to the OTS for approval, the savings association shall: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (1) Informally seek suggestions from the public in its service area(s) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
while developing the plan; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (2) Once the savings association has developed a plan, formally solicit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public comment on the plan for at least 30 days by publishing notice in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
newspaper of general circulation in each of its service areas; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (3) During the period of formal public comment, make copies of the plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available for review at all offices of the savings association in any service area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
covered by the plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Submission of plan. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The savings association shall submit its plan to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the OTS at least three months prior to the proposed effective date of the plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The savings association shall also submit with its plan any public comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received, and, if the plan was revised in light of the comments received, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial plan as released for public comment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Measurable goals. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) A savings association shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specify in its plan measurable goals for helping to meet the credit needs of each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of its service area(s) covered by the plan, particularly the needs of low- and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moderate-income geographies and low- and moderate-income individuals, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through lending, investment, and the provision of services, as appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (ii) A savings association shall address all three performance categories 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and, unless the savings association has been designated as a wholesale or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited purpose savings association, shall emphasize lending and lending-related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities. Nevertheless, a different emphasis, including a focus on one or more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance categories, may be appropriate if responsive to the characteristics 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and credit needs of its service area, considering public comment and the savings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
association's capacity and constraints, product offerings, and business strategy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Confidential information. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The savings association may submit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional information to the OTS on a confidential basis, but the goals stated in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the plan shall be sufficiently specific to enable the public and the OTS to judge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fairly the merits of the plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Satisfactory and outstanding goals. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A savings association shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specify in its plan measurable goals that constitute ``satisfactory'' performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A plan may specify measurable goals that constitute ``outstanding'' performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to be considered for an ``outstanding'' performance rating, the savings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
association shall submit both ``satisfactory'' and ``outstanding'' performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
goals.

Timing. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OTS shall act upon a plan within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
60 days after the complete plan and required accompanying material are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted. If the OTS fails to act within this time period, the plan shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deemed approved unless the OTS extends the review period for good cause. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Public participation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In evaluating the plan's goals, the OTS shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider the public's involvement in formulating the plan, public comment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the plan, and any response by the savings association to public comment on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan.

Criteria for evaluating plan. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OTS shall evaluate a plan's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurable goals using the following criteria, as appropriate: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (i) The extent and breadth of lending or lending-related activities, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including, as appropriate, the distribution of loans among different geographies, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
businesses and farms of different sizes, and individuals of different income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels, the extent of community development lending, and the use of innovative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or flexible lending practices to address credit needs;

Ratings in general.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Subject to paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, the OTS shall assign to a savings association a rating of ``outstanding,''
``satisfactory,'' ``needs to improve,'' or ``substantial noncompliance'' based on the savings association's
performance under the lending, investment and service tests, the community development test, the small savings
association assessment standards, or an approved strategic plan, as applicable.

rating for a savings association assessed under the lending, investment, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service tests in accordance with the procedures provided in Appendix A of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part and the following principles: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A savings association's rating on the lending test shall be weighed so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as to count for at least 50 percent of its assigned rating; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A savings association that receives an ``outstanding'' rating on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lending test shall receive an assigned rating of at least ``satisfactory''; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A savings association that receives an ``outstanding'' rating on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lending test and an ``outstanding'' rating on either the service test or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investment test shall receive an assigned rating of ``outstanding'';

and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) No savings association may receive an assigned rating of

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices shall adversely affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the OTS's evaluation of a savings association's performance. In determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the effect on the savings association's assigned rating, the OTS shall consider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the nature and extent of the evidence, the policies and procedures that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
savings association has in place to prevent discriminatory or other illegal credit practices, any corrective action
that the savings association has taken or has committed to take, particularly voluntary corrective action resulting
from self-assessment, and other relevant information, such as the savings association's past fair lending performance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subject to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
savings association may delineate its service area(s) using any method it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chooses provided that the service area(s): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Do(es) not reflect illegal discrimination; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Do(es) not arbitrarily exclude low- and moderate-income geographies, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taking into account the savings association's size and financial condition and the extent of its branching network,
as appropriate; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(1) Shall include those geographies in the local areas around a savings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
association's branches and deposit-taking ATMs in which the savings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
association has originated or had outstanding, during the previous calendar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year, a significant number and amount of home mortgage, small business and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small farm, and (if the savings association chooses to have them considered in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its CRA evaluation) consumer loans and any other geographies equidistant from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its branches and deposit-taking ATMs, taking into account political boundaries

(2) A savings association's performance need not fit each aspect of a particular rating profile in order to receive
that rating, and exceptionally strong performance with respect to some aspects may compensate for weak performance
in others. The savings association's overall performance, however, should generally be consistent with the appropriate
profile stated below.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Eligibility for an outstanding rating. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A small savings association that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meets each of the standards for a ``satisfactory'' rating under this paragraph and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeds some or all of those standards may warrant consideration for an overall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rating of ``outstanding''. In assessing whether a small savings association's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance is ``outstanding'', the OTS shall consider the extent to which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
savings association exceeds each of the assessment standards for a ``satisfactory'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rating and its performance in making qualified investments (as defined in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;563e.23 of this part) and its performance in providing branches, ATMs or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other services and delivery systems that enhance credit availability in its service

area(s).

Needs to improve or substantial noncompliance ratings.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 A small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
savings association also may receive a rating of ``needs to improve'' or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``substantial noncompliance'' depending on the degree to which its performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has failed to meet the standards for a ``satisfactory'' rating.

 Satisfactory goals.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OTS shall approve as ``satisfactory'' measurable goals that adequately help meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the credit needs of each of a savings association's service area(s). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Outstanding goals.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the plan identifies a separate group of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurable goals that substantially exceed the levels approved as ``satisfactory,'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the OTS shall approve those goals as ``outstanding.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Rating. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The OTS shall assess the performance of a savings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
association operating under an approved plan to determine if the savings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
association has met its plan goals: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If the savings association substantially achieves its plan goals for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfactory rating, the OTS shall rate the savings association's performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the plan as ``satisfactory.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the savings association exceeds its plan goals for a satisfactory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rating and substantially achieves its plan goals for an outstanding rating, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OTS shall rate the savings association's performance under the plan as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``outstanding''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If the savings association fails to substantially meet its plan goals for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a satisfactory rating, it shall be rated as either ``needs to improve'' or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``substantial noncompliance,'' depending on the extent to which it falls short of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its plan goals, or if the savings association so elected at the time it first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted its plan, it shall be rated under the lending, investment and service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tests (as described in &sect;&sect;563e.22 through 563e.24 of this part), the community 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development test (as described in &sect;563e.25 of this part), or the small savings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
association assessment standards (as described in &sect;563e.26 of this part), as

Instructions For Collection Of Data In Connection with Small Business and Small Farm Loans. Keep in mind that data
reported on the register are outstandings as of December 31 and not originations as are reported for some other regulatory
purposes. Your institution may collect the data on separate registers at different branches or on separate registers
for different loan types (small business or small farm), but make sure each loan number is unique. Entries need not
be grouped on your registers by MSA, or chronologically, or by census tract, or in any other particular order.

1. Loan Number_Enter an identifying number that can be used to retrieve the loan file. It can be any number (not exceeding
25 characters). Use letters, numerals, or a combination of both. Make sure that all numbers are unique within the institution.
If registers contains data for branch offices, for example, use a letter or a numerical code to identify the loans of
different branches or assign a certain series of numbers to particular branches to avoid duplicate numbers. The use
of the borrower's tax-payer identification number or social security number is strongly discouraged for privacy
reasons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Outstanding Loan Amount_Enter the outstanding loan amount (balance) as of December 31. Show the amount in thousands
rounding to the nearest thousand. Do not report loans with balances below $500. For example, a loan with a balance of
$500 would be rounded to $1,000; a loan balance of $50,300 would be rounded to $50,000; and a balance of $15,700 would
be rounded to $16,000.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Beginning July 1, 1995, financial institutions required to report small business and small farm 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loan registers are to collect information on the racial, ethnic, and gender make-up of applicants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or borrowers in connection with small business and small farm loans. If you take a written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application, you should list questions regarding the percent of minority and gender ownership 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on your loan application form or on a separate form completed by the applicant in conjunction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with an application. If you do not take a written application, you should request the information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at an appropriate time during the application or origination process; you must request the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information for each loan you originate even if you did not take a written application. If you 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neither take a written application nor originate the loan, you do not have to request the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information. See the sample form for recommended format and language. This information is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be maintained in the institution's in-house loan files. This information is not to be reported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the agency, but is to be used to complete the small business and small farm loan register.

B. Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. You must ask for this information, but cannot require the applicant or borrower to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide it. You may not consider whether or not an applicant or borrower has provided this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information in making your decision whether to extend credit or in setting the terms of credit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. If the applicant or borrower chooses not to provide the information, note this fact on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Inform the applicant or borrower that the Federal government is requesting this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information in order to monitor compliance with Federal statutes that prohibit lenders from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discriminating on these bases.

 The Board is publishing for public comment proposed changes to Regulation C (Home Mortgage Disclosure) and to the
instructions that financial institutions must use to comply with the annual reporting requirements under the regulation.
The amendments reflect revisions proposed by the Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of Thrift Supervision to their regulations implementing the Community
Reinvestment Act (CRA). Under the joint CRA proposal, banks or savings associations that report data about their
home mortgage lending pursuant to HMDA_and that have assets of $250 million or more, or that are subsidiaries of a holding
company with total banking and thrift assets of $250 million or more_would collect and report geographic information
on loans and loan applications relating to property located outside the MSAs in which the institution has a home or
branch office. Currently, geographic identification is required only within MSAs where these lenders have an office.
Data would be collected and reported in accordance with the instructions in Regulation C. The agencies believe that
these data would provide more geographic detail on home mortgage lending that would facilitate complete CRA assessments
for institutions that do not qualify as small banks or thrifts.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Board's Regulation C (12 CFR Part 203) implements the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975 (HMDA) (12 U.S.C. 2801

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). HMDA requires most mortgage lenders located in metropolitan areas to collect data about their housing-related
lending activity. Annually, lenders must report that data to their federal supervisory agencies and disclose the
data to the public. The reports and disclosures cover loan originations, applications that do not result in originations
(for example, applications that are denied or withdrawn), and loan purchases. Information reported includes the
location of the property to which the loan or application relates; the race or national origin, gender, and gross annual
income of the borrower or applicant; and the type of purchaser for loans sold in the secondary market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The federal financial regulatory agencies have proposed amendments to the CRA. The CRA proposal would require banks
or savings associations that report data about their home mortgage lending pursuant to HMDA_and that have assets
of $250 million or more, or that are subsidiaries of a holding company with total banking and thrift assets of $250 million
or more_to collect and report geographic information on loans and applications relating to property located in metropolitan
areas whether or not the institution has a home or branch office there. They will also report geographic information
for property located outside any MSA. (This proposal does not affect the current exemption in &sect;203.3 of Regulation
C for banks and savings associations; for example, institutions whose assets are $10 million or less remain exempt.)
Currently, lenders have the option of collecting this information but are not required to do so. The agencies believe
that these data would provide more geographic detail on home mortgage lending that would facilitate complete CRA
assessments for institutions that do not qualify as small banks or thrifts. The revised final rules would apply to
loan and application data beginning July 1, 1995.

II. Summary of Proposed Amendments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Set forth below is a section-by-section discussion of the proposed amendments to the regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 203.4_Compilation of Loan Data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (e)_Data Reporting Under CRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal would add a new paragraph to implement proposed revisions to the agencies' CRA regulations. Under the
joint CRA proposal, banks or savings associations that report data about their home mortgage lending pursuant to
HMDA_and that have assets of $250 million or more, or that are subsidiaries of a holding company with total banking
and thrift assets of $250 million or more_would collect and report geographic information for all loans and applications,
not just for property in MSAs where the institution has a home or branch office. The requirement also would apply to
property located outside any MSA. The agencies believe that incorporating these reporting requirements in Regulation
C would facilitate compliance for lenders.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to the reporting, disclosure, and other administrative compliance requirements in the proposal, the
Board invites comment on (1) Any administrative burdens that these requirements in the proposal would place on depository
institutions, including small depository institutions and customers of depository institutions; and (2) the benefits
of these requirements in the proposal for depository institutions, their customers, and their communities.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary is proposing to amend 34 CFR Part 682 of the Department's regulations to reflect certain policy decisions
made during development of regulations for the Direct Loan Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by section 492(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, (HEA) the Secretary convened a negotiated
rulemaking committee to develop proposed rules for the second and subsequent years of the Direct Loan Program. During
the negotiated rulemaking process, the Department, at the request of the negotiators, agreed to make changes in the
FFEL Program to conform to policies and procedures adopted in the Direct Loan Program, wherever possible, to provide
a consistent approach in both programs. In addition, some of these changes are necessary to ensure that the terms,
conditions and benefits of FFEL Program loans and Direct Loans are the same, in accordance with Section 455(a)(1)
of the HEA. These proposed regulations reflect those changes that would affect the FFEL Program. In addition, the
Secretary invites comments on other provisions of the FFEL Program regulations that should be revised to conform
with the Direct Loan Program provisions. The proposed Direct Loan Program regulations were published as a separate
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on August 18, 1994, 59 FR 42646. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This NPRM also proposes to delete certain regulatory provisions in 34 CFR Part 682 which duplicate or conflict with
other regulations. Specifically, the Secretary proposes to delete regulations governing the determination of

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These regulations will improve the efficiency of the Federal student aid programs and, by so doing, improve their
capacity to enhance opportunities for postsecondary education. Encouraging students to graduate from high school
and to pursue high quality postsecondary education are important elements of the National Education Goals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The student aid programs also enable both current and future workers to have the opportunity to acquire both basic
and technologically advanced skills needed for today's and tomorrow's workplace. They provide the financial means
for an increasing number of Americans to receive an education that will prepare them to think critically, communicate
effectively, and solve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problems efficiently, as called for in the National Education Goals.

Proposed Regulatory Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposes to amend the following sections of the regulations to reflect changes needed to conform the
FFEL Program to the proposed regulations for the Direct Loan Program. Those changes not related to the Direct Loan
Program are otherwise noted.

_Language that was inadvertently deleted from the FFEL Program final regulations published on June 28, 1994 (59 FR
33334) has been restored and slightly revised. This change would make the regulations consistent with the current
definition in the Direct Loan Program NPRM and the definition previously included in the December 18, 1992 FFEL regulations,
with a minor revision to reflect the 1993 statutory change that includes the amount of the origination fee and the insurance
premium in calculating the student's cost of attendance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 682.201(a)(4)(i)_The Secretary proposes to remove the requirement that, to receive a new loan, a borrower
must reaffirm any FFEL loan amount that previously was canceled due to the borrower's total and permanent disability.

Section 682.205(a)(2)(ix)_The Secretary proposes to amend the regulations to require a lender to answer questions
from borrowers regarding the loan application process and provide information about the terms and conditions for
consolidating FFEL Program loans and the types of loans that may be consolidated. The Secretary believes that borrower
access to this information is critical in light of the expanded repayment options available to consolidation loan
borrowers. This proposed change is also consistent with the obligation assumed by the Direct Loan servicer in the
Direct Loan Program that, although not specified in Direct Loan Program regulations, is assumed by the servicer as
part of its contract with the Department.

Section 682.207(d)(2)(iii)_With regard to late disbursements, the Secretary proposes to permit a lender in certain
circumstances to make a late disbursement more than 60 days after the student ceases to be enrolled at the school on
at least a half-time basis, or after the end of the period of enrollment, as applicable. However, a lender may make a
late disbursement within 30 days after the standard 60-day period provided for in &sect;682.207 only in documented
exceptional circumstances, such as a student's serious, unexpected illness, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the prior approval of the guaranty agency. The Secretary has proposed a comparable provision in the Direct Loan
Program.

Section 682.604(d)(1)(ii)(B)_The Secretary proposes to modify the requirement that the school, as a fiduciary
for the benefit of the student, must retain loan proceeds held at the student's request to assist the student in budgeting,
in a designated trust account. Instead, the regulations propose to allow the school to maintain these funds in a separately-designated
subsidiary account under its general bank account. The Secretary has proposed a comparable provision for the Direct
Loan Program.

Section 682.605_The Secretary proposes to revise this section to clarify that a school must determine the date of
a student's withdrawal by following the procedures in 34 CFR 668.22(i). The Secretary proposes to delete the provisions
regarding leaves of absence. The Secretary's regulations now provide in &sect;668.22 that a student on a leave of
absence is considered to have withdrawn for purposes of the refund calculation. Therefore, the Secretary believes
that, for consistency, such a student should be considered withdrawn for all purposes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Assessment of Costs and Benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order
the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential costs associated with the proposed regulations are those resulting from statutory requirements and
those determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering this program effectively and efficiently. Burdens
specifically associated with information collection requirements, if any, are identified and explained elsewhere
in this preamble under the heading 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of these proposed regulations,
the Secretary has determined that the benefits of the regulations justify the costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary has also determined that this regulatory action does not unduly interfere with State, local, and tribal
governments in the exercises of their governmental functions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist the Department in complying with the specific requirements of Executive Order 12866, the Secretary invites
comment on whether there may be further opportunities to reduce any potential costs or increase potential benefits
resulting from these proposed regulations without impeding the effective and efficient administration of the program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
2. Clarity of the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Executive Order 12866 requires each agency to write regulations that are easy to understand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary invites comments on how to make these proposed regulations easier to understand, including answers
to questions such as the following: (1) Are the requirements in the proposed regulations clearly stated? (2) Do the
regulations contain technical terms or other wording that interferes with their clarity? (3) Does the format of the
regulations (grouping and order of sections, use of headings, paragraphing, etc.) aid or reduce their clarity? Would
the regulations be easier to understand if they were divided into more (but shorter) sections? (A ``section'' is preceded
by the symbol ``&sect;'' and a numbered heading; for example, &sect;682.200 Definitions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (4) Is the description of the regulations in the ``Supplementary Information'' section of this preamble helpful
in understanding the regulations? How could this description be more helpful in making the regulations easier to
understand? (5) What else 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could the Department do to make the regulations easier to understand? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A copy of any comments that concern how the Department could make these proposed regulations easier to understand
should be sent to Stanley M. Cohen, Regulations Quality Officer, U.S. Department of Education, 600 Independence
Avenue, S.W. (Room 5100, FB&hyph;10), Washington, DC 20202&hyph;2241.

Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the statute requires that the Secretary regulate certain actions that must be taken by various program participants,
these requirements would not have a significant impact because they would not impose excessive regulatory burdens
or require unnecessary Federal supervision. The regulations would impose minimal additional requirements to protect
the Federal fiscal interest, as well as the interests of the borrowers under the programs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 682.205, 682.602, 682.604, and 682.605 contain information collection requirements. As required by the
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, the Department will submit a copy of these proposed regulations to the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) for its review. (44 U.S.C. 3504(h))
