I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule proposes to implement section 904 of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Amendments Act of 1988
(42 U.S.C. 3544; hereafter referred to as the ``McKinney Act''), as amended by section 903 of the Housing and Community
Development Act of 1992, Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992 (1992 HCD Act) and section 3003 of the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Pub. L. 103&hyph;66, approved August 10, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 904 of the McKinney Act authorizes HUD to require applicants and participants and adult members of their families
in any HUD program involving initial and periodic review of an applicant's or participant's income to sign a consent
form authorizing: (1) HUD, the PHA, or the owner to verify employee income information from current or previous employers;
and (2) HUD or the PHA to request wage and claim information from the State agency responsible for the administration
of the State unemployment laws. On February 22, 1991, the Department published a final rule implementing section
904 of the McKinney Act (56 FR 7518). In accordance with section 904(b) of the McKinney Act, HUD regulations make signing
the consent form an explicit condition of initial or continuing eligibility for participation in the covered programs.
This requirement is designed to ensure that correct determinations of eligibility for assistance and level of assistance
are made under these programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 903 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (1992 Act) amends section 904 of the McKinney Act by
adding a subsection (e) to section 904. Section 904(e) prohibits the Department from requiring the release of information
by third parties as a condition of receiving housing assistance unless the requested consent for information is in
compliance with the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) and is appropriately limited as to time, relevance and necessity.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department notes that &sect;&sect;200.1220(a) and 760.20(a) of HUD's current regulations (24 CFR 200.1220(a),
24 CFR 760.20(a)) already require that the collection of employee income, wage and claim information be conducted,
to the extent applicable, in accordance with the Privacy Act. Accordingly, this rule does not propose to make any changes
to implement this statutory requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 904(e) also requires that the consent to release such information be limited with respect to time, and only
cover information relevant and necessary to meet the requirements of section 904. In compliance with this statutory
mandate, the Department is preposing to remove the regulatory provisions which authorize the collection of information,
``including information which can be obtained under other laws, regulations and handbooks.'' The rule also proposes
to make the consent to release effective for 15 months from the time of execution, which is responsive to the recommendation
in the House conference report. (H.R. Rep. No. 760, 102 Cong., 2d Sess. at 158 (1992).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Last, section 903 of 1992 Act requires that the Department develop a new consent form. This consent form has been issued
by the Department; therefore, this proposed rule does not cover this release form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3003 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 requires that applicants and participants sign a consent
form authorizing the Secretary of HUD to request that the Commissioner of Social Security and the Secretary of the
Treasury release information pursuant to section 6103(l)(7)(D)(ix) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Information
released under this authority would be provided to HUD for the sole purpose of verifying income information pertinent
to the applicant's or participant's eligibility or level of assisted housing benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, Section 3003 amends section 904 of the McKinney Act to allow HUD to use income return data, pursuant to the Internal
Revenue Code. This information will include: wages, net earnings from self-employment, payments of retirement
income, and unearned income as referenced in sections 6103(l)(7)(A) and 6103(l)7)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code.
HUD may match this information to information provided by applicants or participants when applying for initial or
continued eligibility for assisted housing programs.

A. Environmental Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with 40 CFR 1508.4 of the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality and 24 CFR 50.20(k) of the
HUD regulations, the policies and procedures contained in this proposed rule relate to internal administrative
procedures whose content does not constitute a development decision nor affect the physical condition of project
areas or building sites and, therefore are categorically excluded from the requirements of the National Environmental
Policy Act.

B. Executive Order 12612, Federalism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this proposed rule will not have substantial direct effects on states or their political
subdivisions, or the relationship between the federal government and the states, or on the distribution of power
and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Specifically, the requirements of this proposed rule
are directed toward applicants and participants in federally assisted housing programs. It effects no significant
changes in the current relationships between the federal government, the states and their political subdivisions
in connection with these programs.

C. Executive Order 12606, the Family 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this
proposed rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being,
and, thus, is not subject to review under the order. Under the proposed rule, applicants and participants, and adult
members of their families, are required to sign and submit consent forms authorizing the verification or collection
of certain information necessary for determining eligibility for or level of assistance under the covered programs.
Consent forms to permit verification of information provided by the family are already required. This proposed rule
would prohibit the collection of information which is not necessary to verify the income of an applicant or participant,
and makes the consent form valid for 15 months. No significant change in existing HUD policies or programs will result
from promulgation of this proposed rule, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns.

D. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)) has reviewed and approved this
proposed rule, and in so doing certifies that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. This proposed rule relates to applicants and participants in federally assisted housing
projects but should not have a meaningful economic impact on these entities.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA proposes to approve the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Washington for
the purpose of bringing about the attainment of the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate
matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM&hyph;10). The implementation
plan was submitted by the State to satisfy certain Federal requirements of an approvable moderate nonattainment
area PM&hyph;10 SIP for Tacoma, Washington.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the EPA is approving the State's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views
this as a noncontroversial revision amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the
approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to this proposed rule,
no further activity is contemplated in relation to this rule. If the EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final
rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed
rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this document.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 29, 1994 EPA proposed two drinking water regulations: the Disinfectant/Disinfection Byproducts (D/DBP)
and Enhanced Surface Water Treatment (ESWTR) rules. These proposals were the product of a negotiated rulemaking.
The negotiators included State and local health and regulatory agency staff and elected officials, consumer groups,
environmental groups, and representatives of public water systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The group agreed to propose a disinfectant/disinfection byproduct rule to extend coverage to all community and non
transient, non-community water systems that use disinfectants, reduce the current total trihalomethane (TTHM)
maximum contaminant level (MCL), regulate additional disinfection byproducts, set limits for the use of disinfectants,
and reduce the level of compounds that may react with disinfectants to form byproducts. The group further agreed that
revisions to the current Surface Water Treatment Rule might be required at the same time to ensure that microbial risk
is not increased as byproduct rules go into effect, and to provide explicit control of Cryptosporidium. As a result,
the Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule was proposed with a number of options for microbial control, including
the option to simply retain the requirements of the current Surface Water Treatment Rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the hearings is to provide the public an opportunity to hear a description of the regulations and to obtain
comment from the public on the rules. This notice corrects the hearing dates which were listed in the July 29, 1994 proposals.
The comment period for submission of formal written comments in response to the D/DBPR rule closes December 29, 1994.
The comment period for formal written comments in response to the ESWTR rule closes May 30, 1996 to allow time for the
public to consider data being collected prior to that date. The Agency may hold additional hearings on the ESWTR to
consider those additional data.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposes to amend the financial assurance regulations under the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act in two program areas. First, the Agency proposes to add two financial assurance mechanisms
to those currently available to assure closure, post-closure, or corrective action costs associated with municipal
solid waste landfills under subtitle D: (1) a financial test for use by corporate owners and operators, and (2) a guarantee
for use by firms that wish to guarantee the costs for an owner or operator. Second, the Agency proposes to modify the
domestic asset component of the corporate financial test for hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities
under subtitle C.

These amendments to part 258 are proposed under the authority of sections 1008, 4004, and 4010 of the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6907, 6944, and 6949a. The amendments to parts 264 and 265 are proposed
under RCRA sections 3004 and 3005.

II. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 9, 1991, the Agency promulgated revised criteria for municipal solid waste landfills (MSWLFs), which
established minimum Federal standards to assure that MSWLFs are designed and managed in a manner that is protective
of human health and the environment, taking into account the practical capability of the MSWLFs (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 56 FR 50978). The minimum Federal standards include location restrictions, facility design and operating criteria,
groundwater monitoring, corrective action, financial assurance, closure, and post-closure care requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency proposed the MSWLF criteria, including financial assurance requirements, on August 30, 1988 (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 53 FR 33314). The purpose of the financial assurance requirements of the MSWLF criteria was to assure that adequate
funds will be readily available to cover the costs of closure, post-closure care, and corrective action associated
with MSWLFs. The Agency believes that these financial assurance provisions are an important part of the MSWLF criteria
for two reasons. First, when an owner or operator does not have funds readily available to address the environmental
needs at a facility, delays in addressing those needs can result. Second, if the owner or operator does not have funds
to address environmental needs at its facilities, those needs are typically addressed under federal or state cleanup
authorities, rather than by the party responsible for the facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the August 30, 1988 proposal, rather than propose specific financial assurance mechanisms, the Agency proposed
a financial assurance performance standard. The Agency solicited public comment on this performance standard approach
and, at the same time, requested comment on whether the Agency should develop financial test mechanisms for use by
local governments and corporations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters on the proposed rule argued that the proposed performance standard lacked sufficient detail to guide
States in the development and implementation of requirements with any consistency among States, and that the Agency
should develop specific mechanisms that could be used to demonstrate financial assurance. Commenters also supported
the development of a local government financial test and a corporate financial test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to comment, the Agency promulgated several specific financial mechanisms in the October 9, 1991, final
rule. Those mechanisms include trust funds, surety bonds, letters of credit, insurance, and State assumptions of
responsibility (&sect;258.74). In addition, to retain States' flexibility in implementing the subtitle D program,
the Agency promulgated the financial assurance performance standard of &sect;258.74, which allows approved States
to use any State-approved mechanism that meets that performance standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters on the August 30, 1988, proposal also supported the development of financial tests for local governments
and for corporations. The Agency agreed with commenters but, at the time the final MSWLF criteria were promulgated,
the Agency had not completed the analyses necessary to propose those financial tests. Thus, in the October 9, 1991,
preamble, the Agency announced its intention to develop both a local government and corporate financial test in advance
of the effective date of the financial assurance provisions. The Agency then proceeded to conduct the necessary analysis,
and develop a local government and corporate financial test for MSWLF owners and operators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To allow time to develop financial tests, the Agency promulgated an effective date of April 9, 1994, for the financial
assurance provisions in the July 1, 1991 notice. In doing so, the Agency believed it had allowed adequate time to promulgate
the local government and corporate financial tests in advance of the effective date. However, those financial tests
are taking longer to develop than the Agency originally anticipated. As the April 1994, deadline approached, the
Agency recognized that it would be unable to promulgate final financial tests by that time. Thus, on October 11, 1993,
the Agency extended the effective date of the financial assurance provisions until April 9, 1995 (

The Agency proposed a local government financial test on December 27, 1993 (see 58 FR 68353); this document proposes
the corporate financial test for MSWLFs.

III. Summary of Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule would add a corporate financial test to the financial assurance mechanisms currently available
to owners and operators of subtitle D MSWLFs. It also would allow corporations to use that financial test to guarantee
the costs of an owner or operator. It would allow owners and operators to use a combination of financial assurance mechanisms,
including this financial test, to assure the costs associated with their facilities. Finally, this rule proposes
revisions to one portion of the subtitle C corporate financial test, specifically, to the domestic asset requirement
of that test. Discussion of the proposed revisions to the subtitle D provisions can be found in sections IV&hyph;V
of this preamble. A discussion of the proposed revisions to the subtitle C corporate financial test can be found in
section IX.

IV. Section-by-Section Analysis of Proposed Subtitle D Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Corporate Financial Test (Section 258.74(e)) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed corporate financial test includes a financial component and a domestic asset component. Owners and
operators that meet the requirements of the financial test also must comply with certain recordkeeping and reporting
requirements. Each requirement is described below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Financial Component (Section 258.74(e)(1)) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The financial component is designed to measure viability of the owner or operator, based on its current financial
condition. To satisfy the financial component, a firm must have a minimum tangible net worth of $10 million plus the
costs it seeks to assure (e.g., closure, post-closure, corrective action), either satisfy a bond rating requirement,
or pass one of two financial ratios, and satisfy a domestic asset requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Minimum Size Requirement. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;258.74(e)(1)(ii), the Agency is proposing to require firms using the financial test to have a tangible net
worth at least equal to the sum of the costs they seek to assure through a financial test plus $10 million. Under proposed
&sect;258.74 (e)(3), the costs an owner or operator seeks to assure are equal to the current cost estimates for closure,
post-closure care, and corrective action or the sum of such costs to be covered, and any other environmental obligations
assured by a financial test. The owner or operator must include cost estimates required for municipal solid waste
management facilities under this part, as well as cost estimates required for the following environmental obligations,
if it assures them through a financial test: obligations associated with UIC facilities under 40 CFR 144.62, petroleum
underground storage tank facilities under 40 CFR part 280, PCB storage facilities under 40 CFR part 761, and hazardous
waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities under 40 CFR parts 264 and 265. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is proposing this minimum tangible net worth requirement to ensure that the costs of closure, post-closure
care, or corrective action do not force a firm into bankruptcy. Further, an analysis of a sample of bankrupt firms conducted
by the Agency demonstrated that firms with less than $10 million in net worth failed four times more frequently than
firms with greater than $10 million in tangible net worth. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result, the Agency believes that this minimum net worth should be required as an initial screen for corporations
in demonstrating financial responsibility for the very large costs of closure, post-closure care, and corrective
action. The Agency then combined this requirement with other financial criteria to develop the financial test described
in this proposed rule. A more detailed discussion of this analysis can be found in Section V. of this preamble and the
Background Document developed in support of this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Bond Rating/Financial Ratio Alternatives. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency is proposing to allow firms that meet the minimum size requirement to satisfy the remaining requirements
of the financial test in one of two ways.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
First, under the proposed &sect;258.74(e)(1)(i)(A), a firm could satisfy the financial component if its most recent
bond rating is investment grade, that is, Aaa, Aa, A or Baa, as issued by Moody's, or AAA, AA, A, or BBB, as issued by Standard
and Poor's. The Agency is proposing this option because it believes that a firm's bond rating incorporates an evaluation
of a firm's financial management practices. Bond ratings reflect the expert opinion of bond rating services, which
are organizations that have established credibility in the financial community for their assessments of firm financial
conditions. An analysis of bond ratings showed that bond ratings have been a good indicator of firm defaults, and that
few firms with investment grade ratings have in fact gone bankrupt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal to include a bond rating option in this financial test is consistent with other Agency programs. For example,
the regulations governing TSDFs under 40 CFR parts 264 and 265, petroleum underground storage tanks under 40 CFR part
280, UIC facilities under 40 CFR part 144, and PCB commercial storage facilities under 40 CFR part 761 all consider
bond ratings as part of their financial tests. The local government financial test for owners and operators of MSWLFs
under 40 CFR part 258, which was proposed on December 27, 1993 (58 FR 68353) also would allow a bond rating option. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, to provide the regulated community with flexibility in meeting the financial test, the Agency is also proposing
a ratio alternative to the bond rating. In order to satisfy the ratio requirement, a firm would have to have either:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;a leverage ratio of less than 1.5 based on the ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth. This ratio attempts
to show the degree to which a firm is leveraged. This particular measure shows the relationship between total liabilities
to tangible net worth. Firms with higher values for this ratio are more likely to suffer net losses than those with lower
values; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;a profitability ratio of greater than 0.10 based on the ratio of the sum of net income plus depreciation, depletion,
and amortization, minus $10 million, to total liabilities. This ratio attempts to show cash-flow from operations
relative to the firm's total liabilities. Firms with higher values for this measure are more likely to meet their obligations
than those firms with lower values. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency selected these two specific financial ratios with their associated thresholds based on their ability
to differentiate between viable and bankrupt firms. The Agency's analysis demonstrated that leverage ratios (i.e.,
total liabilities/net worth) and profitability ratios (i.e., cash flow/total liabilities) are particularly good
discriminators of financial health. The Agency selected as thresholds for these ratios values that, together with
the other financial test criteria, minimized the costs associated with demonstrating financial responsibility.
A more detailed discussion of this analysis can be found in Section V. of this preamble and the Background Document
developed in support of this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Domestic Assets Requirement. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;258.74(e)(1)(iii), the Agency is proposing that all firms using the financial test have assets in the United
States at least equal to the costs they seek to assure through a financial test. (see paragraph a. of this section, ``Minimum
Size Requirement,'' for more discussion on assured costs) The domestic asset requirement is intended to ensure that
the Agency has access to funds in the event of bankruptcy. Without this requirement, the Agency could experience substantial
difficulty in accessing funds of bankrupt firms that have their assets outside of the United States. The Agency recognizes
that this minimum assets requirement may be too low and solicits comment on an assets requirement that provides the
Agency with adequate assurance that funds will be available in the event that an owner or operator enters bankruptcy,
but does not overly burden the regulated community.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency is proposing that after a firm has determined that it is eligible to use this corporate financial test, it
would be required to document its use of the test by placing three items (discussed below) in the facility operating
record. These requirements would help ensure that the self-implementing aspect of the proposed test requirements
have been met. In the case of closure and post-closure care, these items would have to be placed in the operating record
prior to the initial receipt of waste or the effective date of the final rule, whichever is later, or in the case of corrective
action, no later than 120 days following selection of a corrective action remedy. This proposed requirement, in the
case of corrective action remedy, is consistent with the subtitle C provision in the subpart S proposed rulemaking
(55 FR at 30855 July 27, 1990), as well as the Financial Assurance for Corrective Action (FACA) proposed rulemaking
(51 FR at 37854 October 24, 1986). Please refer to these proposals for more discussion on this requirement. In addition,
owners and operators would be required to update these items annually, and to notify the State Director and obtain
alternative financial assurance if the firm is no longer able to pass the financial test. These proposed criteria
are described below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Chief financial officer (CFO) letter. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under &sect;258.74(e)(2)(i), the owner or operator would be required to submit a letter from the firm's CFO. The letter
would demonstrate that the firm has complied with the criteria of the test. Specifically, the letter would list all
cost estimates covered by a financial test and provide evidence that the firm satisfies the financial criteria of
the test (i.e., the financial component, including the minimum size component and domestic assets requirement).
The Agency expects that this evidence will include a worksheet or similar demonstration showing that the firm's annual
financial data meet the specific measures required by the test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Accountant's opinion. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under &sect;258.74(e)(2)(ii), the Agency is also proposing to require the owner or operator to place in the operating
record the opinion from the independent certified public accountant of the firm's financial statements for the latest
completed fiscal year. Further requirements of the CFO's letter are described in &sect;258.74(e)(2)(iii). An unqualified
opinion (i.e., a ``clean opinion'') from the accountant demonstrates that the firm has prepared its financial statements
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for corporations. However, an adverse opinion, disclaimer
of opinion, or any qualification in the opinion would automatically disqualify the owner or operator from using the
corporate financial test. The State Director of an approved State may evaluate qualified opinions on a case by case
basis, however, and accept such opinions if the matters which form the basis for the qualified opinion are insufficient
to warrant disallowance of the test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Special report from the independent certified public accountant. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The third item to be placed in the operating record would be a special report of the independent certified public accountant
upon examination of the chief financial officer's letter. In this report, the accountant would confirm that the data
used in the CFO letter to pass the test were appropriately derived from, the audited, year-end financial statements.
The purpose of this special report is to ensure that the accountant has confirmed that the financial data used in the
CFO letter is appropriately presented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This report would not be required if the CFO uses financial test figures directly from the annual financial statements
provided to the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). However, this report is required if the CFO letter uses data
that is derived from and is not identical to the data in the annual financial statements provided to the SEC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, in computing financial assurance under one alternative owners and operators are required to recognize
total liabilities, including those associated with ``post-retirement benefits other than pensions (OPEB).''
(Please see the discussion of FASB 106 in section VI of this preamble.) The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
allows the use of two different methods when accounting for these liabilities in annual financial statements. FASB
106 allows employers the option of accounting for OPEB obligations in one year (immediate recognition) or over a consecutive
number of years (delayed recognition). Since both the immediate and delayed recognition methods are allowed by FASB
106, EPA does not require owners and operators that are demonstrating they meet the requirements of the financial
test to use the same accounting method for OPEB obligations that is used for annual SEC submission purposes. For example,
the owner or operator may use the immediate recognition method in the financial statement prepared for the SEC, but
the delayed recognition method in computing liabilities for the purpose of demonstrating RCRA financial assurance.

EPA is proposing this approach in today's rule because it does not believe a separate CPA statement is needed where
the CFO simply takes figures directly from an audited financial statement. This is a straight forward process. On
the other hand, where the CFO ``derives'' the figures_for example, by using different accounting procedures to determine
OPEB liabilities_the process may require a high level of financial expertise. In these cases, EPA believes review
by an independent auditor is appropriate. The Agency solicits comment on this approach and whether this approach
would be appropriate for the financial test under subtitle C.

Annual updates and placement of financial test documentation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The financial test proposed in this action would require firms to place the items specified in &sect;258.74(e)(2)
in the operating record and notify the State Director that these items have been placed in the facilities operating
record. Because the financial condition of firms can change over time, under &sect;258.74(e)(2), firms will be required
to update annually all financial test documentation, including each of the items described above, within 90 days
of the close of the firm's fiscal year. Under &sect;258.74 (e)(2)(iv), the owner or operator is not required to submit
the items specified in &sect;258.74(e)(2) when he substitutes alternate financial assurance as specified in this
section; or is released from the requirements of this section in accordance with &sect;258.71(b), &sect;258.72(b),
or &sect;258.73(b).

Alternate financial assurance. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under &sect;258.74(e)(2)(v), if a firm can no longer meet the terms of the financial test, the owner or operator would
have to notify the State Director and obtain alternative financial assurance within 120 days of the close of the firm's
fiscal year. The alternative financial assurance selected by the owner or operator would have to meet the terms of
this section and the required submissions for that assurance would have to be placed in the facility's operating record.
The owner or operator would have to notify the State Director that he no longer meets the criteria of the financial test
and that alternate financial assurance has been obtained.

Current financial test documentation.

Under proposed &sect;258.74(e)(2)(vi), the Director of an approved State may, based on a reasonable belief that
the owner or operator no longer meets the requirements of paragraph (e)(1) of this section, require the owner or operator
to provide current financial test documentation as specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. Although the Agency
anticipates this provision will not be used often, it can be important in situations where the financial condition
of the owner or operator comes into question. The State Director should have the flexibility to require the owner or
operator to provide current financial test documents if information arises that raises serious questions about
the financial conditions of the owner or operator. For example, an owner or operator may be forced into bankruptcy
by a large, well-publicized liability judgment. In such cases, the State Director should be able to investigate the
owner's or operator's change in financial condition, and require them to demonstrate that they still meet the financial
test. The Agency requests comments from the public on this proposed requirement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Corporate Guarantee (Section 258.74(g)) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule proposes to allow owners and operators to comply with financial responsibility requirements for MSWLFs
using a guarantee provided by another private firm (the guarantor). Under such a guarantee, the guarantor promises
to pay for or carry out closure, post-closure care or corrective action activities on behalf of the owner or operator
of a MSWLF if the owner or operator fails to do so. Guarantees, like other third-party mechanisms, such as letters of
credit or surety bonds, ensure that a third party is obligated to cover the costs of closure, post-closure care, or
corrective action in the event that the owner or operator goes bankrupt or fails to conduct the required activities.
At the same time, a guarantee is an attractive compliance option for owners and operators, especially those affiliated
with larger corporations because guarantees are generally much less expensive than other third-party mechanisms.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would allow three types of qualified guarantors: (1) The parent corporation or principal shareholder
of the owner or operator (e.g., a corporate parent or grandparent), (2) a firm whose parent company is also the parent
company of the owner or operator (a corporate sibling), and (3) other related and non-related firms with a ``substantial
business relationship'' with the owner or operator (including subsidiaries of the owner or operator). Guarantors
also would be required to meet the conditions of the corporate financial test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To comply with the requirements of the corporate guarantee, the owner or operator would be required to place in the
facility operating record a copy of the guarantee contract and copies of all of the financial test documentation that
is required of the guarantor as specified in the corporate financial test requirements. The terms of the guarantee
contract must specify that, if the owner or operator fails to perform closure, post-closure care, or corrective action
in accordance with the requirements of part 258, the guarantor will either: (1) carry out those activities or pay the
costs of having them conducted by a third party (performance guarantee), or (2) fund a trust to pay the costs of the activities
(payment guarantee). The required documentation must be placed in the operating record, in the case of closure and
post-closure care, prior to the initial receipt of waste or the effective date of the final rule, whichever is later,
or in the case of corrective action, no later than 120 days following selection of a corrective action remedy. The financial
test documentation from the guarantor must be updated annually, in accordance with the requirements of the corporate
financial test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The financial test documentation required of the guarantor is the same as that required of a corporate financial test
user except that, in cases where the guarantor is not a corporate parent, grandparent, or sibling, the letter from
the chief financial officer must address the ``substantial business relationship'' (as defined in &sect;264.141(h))
that exists between the owner or operator and the guarantor. In particular, the letter must describe the relationship
and the consideration received from the owner or operator in exchange for the guarantee, which is necessary to ensure
that the contract is valid and enforceable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal would require that guarantors agree to remain bound under this guarantee for so long as the owner or operator
must comply with the applicable financial assurance requirements of subpart G of part 258, except that guarantors
may cancel this guarantee by sending notice to the State Director and to the owner or operator. The proposal would provide
that such cancellation cannot become effective earlier than 120 days after receipt of such notice by both the State
Director and the owner or operator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a guarantee is cancelled, the proposal would require the owner or operator to, within 90 days following receipt
of the cancellation notice by the owner or operator and the State Director, obtain alternate financial assurance,
place evidence of that alternate financial assurance in the facility operating record, and notify the State Director.
If the owner or operator fails to provide alternate financial assurance within the 90-day period, the guarantor must
provide that alternate assurance within 120 days, place evidence of the alternate assurance in the facility operating
record, and notify the State Director. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the corporate guarantor no longer meets the requirements of the financial test, the owner or operator would have
to, within 90 days following the close of the guarantor's fiscal year, obtain alternative assurance, place evidence
of the alternate assurance in the facility operating record, and notify the State Director. If the owner or operator
fails to provide alternate financial assurance within the 90-day period, the guarantor would be required to provide
that alternate assurance within 120 days following the close of the guarantor's most recent fiscal year, place evidence
of the alternate assurance in the facility operating record, and notify the State Director.

Calculation of Obligations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
EPA currently allows financial tests as mechanisms to demonstrate financial assurance for environmental obligations
under several programs. These include hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities under 40 CFR
parts 264 and 265, petroleum underground storage tanks under 40 CFR part 280, UIC facilities under 40 CFR part 144,
and PCB commercial storage facilities under 40 CFR part 761. Under each of these programs, the Agency requires that
the owner or operator include all of the costs it is assuring through a financial test when it calculates its obligations.
This policy prevents an owner or operator from using the same assets to assure different obligations under different
programs. The Agency believes this is vital to assure the effectiveness of the financial test and assure that assets
are available to assure all of the environmental obligations covered by the test. Thus, consistent with Agency policy,
today's proposal requires a firm using a financial test for its subtitle D obligations also to include those costs
covered under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other Agency programs when it calculates assured costs.

V. Domestic Asset Requirement for the Subtitle C Corporate Financial Test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Agency is proposing to modify the domestic asset requirement of the current subtitle C financial test. The current
regulations at &sect;&sect;264.143(f)(1)(i)(D) and (ii)(D); 265.143(e)(1) (i)(D) and (ii)(D); 264.145(f)(1)
(i)(D) and (ii)(D); 265.145(e)(1) (i)(D) and (ii)(D); 264.147(f)(1) (i)(D) and (ii)(D); and 265.147(f)(1) (i)(D)
and (ii)(D) require that corporations using the financial test have assets located in the U.S. amounting to at least
90% of total assets or at least six times the sum of costs assured through the financial test. The purpose of this requirement
is to assure access to funds in the event of bankruptcy. The Agency is concerned that without a domestic asset requirement,
it could experience difficulty in accessing funds of bankrupt firms whose assets are located outside of the United
States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the Agency proposed revisions to the subtitle C corporate financial test in the July 1, 1991, notice, at 56 FR 30201,
the Agency did not propose revisions to the domestic asset requirement portion of that financial test. However, commenters
on that proposal argued that the domestic asset requirement should be revised, as it unnecessarily limits the use
of the test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to comment received on the July 1 notice, the Agency is proposing a revised domestic asset requirement
for subtitle C. The Agency is proposing that corporations using the financial test be required to have assets in the
U.S. at least equal to the sum of all environmental obligations assured by a financial test. This approach is consistent
with the domestic asset requirement proposed in today's corporate financial test for subtitle D. The Agency solicits
comment on its proposal to modify the subtitle C domestic asset requirement.

VI. Analysis Supporting This Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The discussion below describes the analysis conducted by the Agency to develop the ratio alternative, minimum net
worth requirement, and domestic asset requirement of this proposed corporate financial test. These provisions,
which are proposed in this notice for use under the subtitle D program, also were proposed by the Agency on July 1, 1991,
for use under the subtitle C program (56 FR 30201). In conducting analysis to support today's proposal, the Agency
relied in large part on analysis conducted in support of the July 1, 1991, subtitle C rulemaking. This section of the
preamble discusses the subtitle C analysis, and additional analysis conducted to support development of this proposal.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For a more detailed description of the subtitle C analysis, the reader can refer to the preamble of the July 1, 1991,
proposal (56 FR 30201), and to the Background Document supporting the July 1 proposal, which can be found in the docket
for that rulemaking (Docket No. F&hyph;91&hyph;RCFP&hyph;FFFFF). For a more detailed description of the analysis
to support this subtitle D corporate financial test proposal, the reader can refer to the Background Document for
today's rule, which can be found in the docket for this proposal.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
First, the Agency examined whether the test should include a minimum net worth requirement. Second, the Agency developed
various financial tests and analyzed their performance in discriminating between bankrupt and viable firms. Finally,
the Agency evaluated those tests that best discriminated between viable and bankrupt firms according to a ``least
cost'' criterion, and selected a financial test. Each of these analytical steps is described below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 -->
1. Minimum Net Worth Requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In developing the subtitle C corporate financial test, the Agency determined that a minimum net worth requirement
was an important element of the test. First, the Agency was concerned that, because of their magnitude, the costs of
closure and post-closure care could themselves cause smaller firms to go bankrupt. In addition, the need for a minimum
net worth requirement was supported by analysis. The Agency found significantly higher bankruptcy rates for firms
with a net worth less than $10 million. For example, firms with less than $10 million in net worth failed four times more
frequently than firms with greater than $10 million in net worth. Based on the above, the Agency decided to propose
a minimum net worth requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To determine the threshold for this minimum net worth requirement, the Agency analyzed public and private costs associated
with different thresholds. The Agency chose $10 million as the threshold because the analysis demonstrated that
although a higher threshold would result in savings in public costs, those savings would not offset the additional
costs to the regulated community of obtaining alternative financial assurance mechanisms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 -->
2. Develop and Analyze Alternative Financial Tests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Agency first conducted a search of financial literature and identified possible financial ratios typically
used for bankruptcy prediction. In addition to financial ratios, the Agency selected a variety of other financial
measures, such as multiples requirements for net worth and net working capital (i.e., one through six times the size
of the financial obligation) and ``additive'' requirements, which required firms to have a certain level of net worth
(in addition to the minimum net worth requirement of $10 million) based on the amount of costs they wished to cover with
the test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency then evaluated the performance of these individual financial measures in discriminating between viable
and bankrupt firms. Using samples of bankrupt and non-bankrupt firms, the Agency evaluated their ability to ``pass''
non-bankrupt firms capable of meeting their financial assurance obligations, and, at the same time, ``fail'' bankrupt
firms that would enter bankruptcy without the means to meet those obligations. Each financial measure was evaluated
using two performance measures:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Availability
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 (A): Measured as the percentage of total financial assurance obligations facing non-bankrupt firms with over $10
million in net worth that can be covered using a particular financial measure or financial test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Misprediction
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 (M): Measured as the percentage of total financial assurance obligations facing bankrupt firms that can be covered
by bankrupt firms using the financial test.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Those individual financial measures that performed relatively well at differentiating between the two samples
had a high differential between the availability (A) and misprediction (M) measures; i.e., they allow viable firms
to cover a relatively large percentage of obligations and, at the same time, screen out a large share of obligations
of bankrupt firms. Those measures that performed relatively poorly had about the same availability to viable firms
and bankrupt firms; i.e., they allowed bankrupt and non-bankrupt firms to cover a similar percentage of obligations.
In some cases, poorly-performing measures had a negative differential_they allowed bankrupt firms to cover a higher
percentage of obligations than non-bankrupt firms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency's analysis of ratio measures found that profitability ratios, which measure a firm's net income or cash
flow in relation to firm size (e.g., cash flow/total liabilities) and leverage ratios, which measure a firm's debt
in relation to firm size (i.e., total liabilities/net worth) were particularly good at discriminating between bankrupt
and non-bankrupt firms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency then combined various profitability and leverage ratios, which had performed well at distinguishing
between bankrupt and non-bankrupt firms, to form alternative financial tests. A variety of possible multiple and
additive requirements for net worth were then added to each combination of financial ratios. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The process described above led to the development of over 500 ``candidate'' alternative financial tests. These
candidate financial tests were then evaluated in a similar manner against the samples of bankrupt and non-bankrupt
firms to determine their ability to pass non-bankrupt firms capable of meeting their financial assurance obligations
(availability or ``A'') and their ability to screen out bankrupt firms that would enter bankruptcy without the means
to meet those obligations (misprediction or ``M''). From these candidates, ``dominant'' tests were selected, i.e.,
tests with the highest ability to pass non-bankrupt firms for given levels of bankruptcy misprediction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency then calculated the public and private cost of each ``dominant'' test. The Agency defined public costs
as the costs to the public sector of paying for financial assurance obligations for firms that pass the test but later
go bankrupt without funding their obligations, and private costs as the cost to viable firms of obtaining alternative
financial assurance mechanisms when they cannot pass the test. The amount of public and private costs associated
with a particular test depends on the test's performance in terms of its availability to viable firms and its ability
to screen out bankrupt firms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Select a Financial Test for Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency then identified a set of low-cost tests, and selected a test from that group for proposal. The Agency based
its selection on policy considerations as well as the total costs of the financial tests. The Agency took this approach,
rather than select the lowest cost test, because several tests had very similar total costs but different balances
between public and private costs. Using this modified cost-effectiveness approach, the Agency was able to consider
the balance of public and private costs among tests of approximately equal total costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exhibit 1 presents total public and private costs of the top two tests identified. Test 94 was the lowest-cost test
analyzed, but the Agency proposed Test 902 in the July 1, 1991, rule for several reasons. First, Test 94 included a tax
rate adjustment (FR) in the cash flow ratio which may change over time, thus making it a more difficult test to implement
and verify. (The estimate shown in Exhibit 1 is that all firms are subject to a 34 percent corporate tax rate). In contrast,
Test 902 required a cash flow ratio adjusted by a set value of $10 million,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 rather than by a tax adjusted cost estimate. Second, Test 902 required a net worth of $10 million plus the amount of the
cost to be assured (an additive requirement), whereas Test 94 required that the net worth be at least $10 million and
that it be at least the amount of the cost to be assured. The Agency believed that the net worth additive requirement
of Test 902 would ensure that a firm has net worth sufficient to cover its financial assurance obligations and has an
additional $10 million in net worth to cover other debts and obligations as necessary. Finally, Test 902 had a different
balance of public and private costs than Test 94. Because it is less available to firms, it had higher private costs
than Test 94. However, the substantial improvement in bankruptcy screening (lower misprediction, or ``M'') led
to far lower public costs than Test 94, so that the total costs were close to the total costs of Test 94.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency analyzed many cash-flow ratios, some of which subtracted a constant amount (e.g., $5 million, $10 million,
$15 million), others of which, like the ratio in Test 94, subtracted variable amounts. Of the ratios that subtracted
a constant amount, this ratio, which subtracted $10 million, was the most effective in reducing public and private
costs.

B. The Subtitle D Corporate Financial Test Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
As was discussed above, the approach used by the Agency to evaluate alternative subtitle D financial tests was consistent
with the 1991 subtitle C analysis. However, because candidate measures for the 1991 subtitle C analysis were assembled
from a thorough review of available research on bankruptcy predictors, the Agency decided that additional research
was not likely to identify any new candidate measures. Therefore, the Agency did not consider it necessary to repeat
the process of assembling and testing candidate financial measures, and combining the most promising candidate
measures into alternative financial test configurations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Instead, the Agency used the alternative financial tests identified in the subtitle C analysis as the starting point
for the subtitle D analysis. The Agency then developed firm samples and cost estimates for the subtitle D program,
and proceeded to evaluate those candidate financial tests using basically the same procedure used for subtitle C,
with minor modifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

1. Firm Samples
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The Agency identified 16 non-bankrupt firms (12 public and 4 private) that own or operate MSWLFs. One of the private
firms, which appeared to be quite small, was dropped from the sample for lack of financial data. Two of the remaining
private firms were deleted because they had tangible net worth less than $10 million. The final non-bankrupt firm
sample, then, consisted of 13 firms_12 public and one private.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency believes that the same policy considerations discussed above for subtitle C compel use of a $10 million
net worth requirement for subtitle D. In addition, the Agency conducted analysis to determine whether a lower net
worth requirement would significantly increase the amount of financial assurance that could be covered by the subtitle
D financial test. The Agency found that the 3 small firms excluded by the minimum net worth requirement owned only 12
MSWLFs, which were less than half the size of the landfills owned and operated by larger firms. Therefore, the Agency
concluded that a lower minimum net worth requirement would not significantly increase the availability of the subtitle
D corporate financial test.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The bankrupt firm sample used in the subtitle C corporate financial test analysis was also used for the subtitle D financial
test analysis. That sample consisted of 31 firms, which were either known to operate hazardous waste facilities or
were likely to do so. The Agency believed that this was the best sample of bankrupt firms available for the subtitle
D analysis for several reasons. First, owning and operating MSWLFs entails a capital-intensive, long-term investment
in engineering and construction for industrial activity, similar to the industrial activities of many firms in the
subtitle C universe. Second, firms in the MSWLF industry, like firms in the subtitle C universe, are subject to environmental
regulations and associated compliance costs. Third, the Agency could not identify bankruptcies of MSWLF firms,
as they have not been subject to Federal regulatory requirements and, therefore, have not been identified like subtitle
C facilities, which were required to notify EPA of their existence in 1980, thus providing the Agency with historical
data.

Closure and Post-Closure Care.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Agency's derived estimates of closure and post-closure care costs from data provided by the Regulatory Impacts
Analysis (RIA) of the proposed subtitle D MSWLF criteria (56 FR 50978).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the analysis predated the effective date of the landfill criteria, the Agency did not have site-specific
cost estimates for firms that own or operate MSWLFs. Therefore, the Agency estimated the financial assurance obligations
for each firm in the non-bankrupt firm sample, based on the number and size of landfills owned or operated by each firm,
and the Agency's estimate of closure and post-closure care costs per landfill.

Corrective Action. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency took a different approach to analyzing the impact of corrective action costs on the performance of alternative
financial tests. As in the case of closure and post-closure care, the Agency did not have site-specific data on the
cost of corrective action. However, unlike the costs of closure and post-closure, corrective action costs are not
certain to occur. In addition to not having site-specific cost data, the Agency also did not have data on the probability
of corrective action being necessary. Therefore, the Agency did not attempt to estimate site-specific costs to analyze
the impact of corrective action costs on the performance of alternative financial tests; rather, the Agency conducted
a sensitivity analysis, which is described later in this preamble.

Note that in the 1991 subtitle C analysis, the alternative financial tests were evaluated against the firm samples
to establish a set of dominant tests, and the sum of public and private costs was then calculated for each dominant test.
However, in the subtitle D analysis, the sample size of non-bankrupt firm sample was so small (13 firms) that directly
calculating the sum of the public and private costs for each of the alternative test configurations was more analytically
efficient.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Though Test 58 was the lowest cost test, the Agency did not select it for proposal because that test did not include a
minimum net worth requirement beyond the $10 million. The Agency believes that an additional net worth requirement
that is related to the costs to be assured is important to assure that the firm's environmental costs will not increase
the probability of firm failure. For example, if a firm had a net worth of $10 million, but closure and post-closure
costs of $100 million, those costs would, in all likelihood, cause the firm to enter bankruptcy. Thus, the Agency eliminated
Test 58 from consideration and considered for proposal only those financial tests that had a minimum net worth requirement
that considered the size of the obligation to be assured. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tests 562 and 130 are identical except for the minimum net worth requirement. Test 130 requires that the firm's minimum
net worth be at least $10 million and that it be at least the amount of the closure and post-closure care cost estimate.
Test 562 requires a minimum net worth be equal to $10 million plus the closure and post-closure care cost estimate.
The Agency selected Test 562 for proposal for several reasons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, the Agency believes that requiring a $10 million minimum net worth requirement in addition to net worth equal
to the firm's assured costs protects against environmental obligations themselves causing bankruptcy. Second,
there was no difference in the availability of Test 130 and Test 562, so there was no compelling reason to select Test
130. Finally, selection of Test 562, which is identical to the corporate financial test proposed for subtitle C follows
the Agency's policy of maintaining consistency among programs wherever possible.

As was mentioned above, the Agency conducted a sensitivity analysis to determine whether the costs of corrective
action would affect the performance of the candidate financial tests. This analysis evaluated the alternative tests
for closure, post-closure care, and corrective action costs under three scenarios_corrective action costs equal
to 50%, 100%, and 200% of the costs of closure and post-closure. Under each scenario, Test 130 and Test 562 were the lowest
cost tests with a minimum net worth requirement related to the size of obligation to be assured.

Concerns have been raised by some members of the regulated community that the December 1990 Statement issued by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board, entitled ``Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions (OPEB)'' (FASB 106), adversely impacts their ability to pass the Agency's corporate financial test for
their environmental obligations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) is ultimately responsible for specifying Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles (GAAP) for publicly-owned firms, the SEC has informally followed policies developed by the FASB, an independent
private organization that is funded by various professional accounting associations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this case, according to FASB 106, employers who do not already account for these benefits as required by the Statement
must do so for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1992 (This requirement is delayed for certain small, non-public
employers to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1994). FASB 106 allows employers the option of accounting
for these benefits in one year (immediate recognition of OPEB) or over a consecutive number of years (delayed recognition
of OPEB). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These members of the regulated community that are concerned about FASB 106 have requested that for Security and Exchange
Commission purposes, they be allowed to continue to use the immediate recognition method, but for purposes of the
Agency's financial test, they be allowed to use the delayed recognition method. Since both the immediate and delayed
recognition of these obligations are allowed by the FASB 106 rule, the Agency believes there is enough flexibility
in the regulations to allow recognition of OPEB benefits in the manner described above. A more detailed description
of EPA's interpretation of the federal regulations governing the corporate financial test within the context of
FASB 106 can be found in the docket in support of this proposal. (

6. Domestic Asset Requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency is proposing that all firms using the financial test have assets in the United States at least equal to the
sum of the costs they seek to assure through the financial test. This domestic asset requirement is intended to ensure
that the Agency has access to funds in the event of bankruptcy. Without this requirement, the Agency could experience
substantial difficulty in accessing funds of bankrupt firms that have their assets outside of the United States.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The domestic asset requirement proposed for the subtitle D corporate owners and operators of MSWLFs is consistent
with revisions to the domestic asset requirement of the subtitle C corporate financial test proposed today (see section
V. of this preamble for further discussion).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 16, 1990, NSWMA submitted a rulemaking petition to the Agency. The Agency has addressed many of the concerns
raised in the petition in a July 1, 1991 proposed rule (56 FR 30201) and a September 16, 1992 final rule (57 FR 42832).
While today's proposed rule addresses two more issues raised in this petition, it does not represent the full Agency
response to NSWMA's petition. The Agency continues to examine the concerns raised in NSWMA's petition.

B. The Meridian Test

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As part of its analysis, the Agency evaluated the test developed by the Meridian Corporation, which was submitted
to EPA on February 16, 1990, along with a rulemaking petition, by the National Solid Wastes Management Association
(NSWMA). Using the methodology described above, the Agency found that the test was not as effective at minimizing
public and private costs as the test proposed on July 1, 1991. As a result, the Agency has not proposed the test developed
by Meridian Corporation for further analysis. The NSWMA petition, the test developed by the Meridian Corporation,
and the Agency's analysis of that test can be found in the docket in support of this proposal. The Agency will consider
and respond to any comments it receives on the Meridian financial test in evaluating the revisions to the corporate
financial test for subtitle C.

C. Request for Comment on Allowing Owners and Operators to Discount Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The financial assurance requirements in many EPA program areas (e.g., RCRA subtitles C and D, TSCA PCBs) require owners
and operators to calculate cost estimates in current dollars, and aggregate these estimates (even though these costs
may be incurred many years in the future). Owners must obtain a financial responsibility instrument for at least the
amount of this aggregated cost estimate. The RCRA regulations currently do not allow owners and operators to adjust
this aggregated cost estimate to reflect the fact that these activities are scheduled to occur in future years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has received many requests to allow owners and operators to meet the financial assurance requirements
based on the present value of these future obligations. In a rulemaking petition submitted on February 16, 1990, the
National Solid Wastes Management Association (NSWMA) recommended that the Agency allow firms to use a present value
based on a discount rate to estimate their costs for post-closure care and for the extended care portion of corrective
action. (The NSWMA petition can be found in the docket of today's rulemaking.) In addition, the Agency has received
public comment making similar requests during the development of other financial-responsibility-related rules.
In the preamble to the proposed local government financial test, the Agency solicited comment on the whether to allow
owners and operators to discount costs associated with MSWLFs (see 58 FR 68353 at 68361, December 27, 1993). The Agency
recognizes that this is an issue of interest to many parties, and has reviewed and considered all comments received
to date.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, the argument presented to the Agency has been, because these expenditures are scheduled to occur in the
future (often many years in the future), a financial instrument for less than the aggregate costs (i.e. the ``present
value'' of the aggregated costs) would pay off these expenditures in the future.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This is the case because there is a time dimension to the value of a monetary or financial instrument_$100 in hand today
is worth more than a (guaranteed) promise to pay $100 in ten years. One hundred dollars invested today, for example,
in a ten-year Treasury bond paying at an interest rate of 7 percent will pay back $197 ten years from now, assuming that
interest is compounded continually.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to make comparisons between alternative financial instruments on capital investment decisions involving
different streams of payments over time, financial analysts, economists, etc., calculate the ``present value''
of the alternatives. This method involves calculating in terms of current dollars using the interest rate_or discount
rate_present value of a promised future receipt (or expenditure). For example, at a 7 percent interest rate, an investor
would be indifferent between receiving $100 five years from now or receiving $71.30 today. The present value, then
of the promise to pay $100 in five years (at a discount rate of 7 percent) would be $71.30. In much the same way, if the Agency
allowed owners and operators to discount their future costs when they demonstrated financial responsibility, an
owner or operator who had a $10 million closure scheduled to occur 20 years in the future could demonstrate financial
responsibility for as little as $2.6 million today, assuming they could invest that amount at the same 7% interest
(or discount ) rate described above. The effect of discounting becomes more pronounced as the time period and discount
rate increase. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency has not proposed to allow owners and operators to discount costs because the Agency remains unconvinced
that by doing so it would assure that adequate funds will be available in a timely manner to perform required activities
in the event that the owner or operator is unable or unwilling to perform these activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, the Agency is concerned that for an approach based on discounting to be effective, it is important that the owner
or operator be able to predict with certainty when the costs will incur. For example, an owner or operator who estimates
that the closure costs of its MSWLF will be $10 million to occur 20 years in the future would only have to demonstrate
financial responsibility for $2.6 million today, assuming a 7 percent discount rate. If that MSWLF unexpectedly
has to close, it may not have sufficient resources to properly complete all closure activities since the amount of
financial responsibility could be substantially less than the actual need. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Despite these concerns, the Agency is interested in allowing owners and operators to discount costs under the subtitle
D program wherever it can do so and still assure that sufficient resources will be available to perform required activities.
The Agency believes that discounting may be more applicable for some activities than others. For example, where the
cost of an activity is known, the timing of the activity can be predicted with a greater degree of certainty, or where
the activity takes place over an extended time period, it may be appropriate to discount costs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although current regulations require owners to have the financial resources to carry out all closure and post-closure
activities in one year, some activities, such as post-closure groundwater monitoring, can only be done over several
decades. Therefore, even if a landfill must close unexpectedly, certain activities (like post-closure care) and
the associated costs will still occur over a number of years in the future. EPA could allow owners to discount these
costs in computing their obligations. However, where the timing and costs associated with an activity are not known,
discounting may not be appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of its interest in allowing owners and operators to discount costs, and because of its concerns about allowing
them to do so, the Agency again solicits comment on the practice of discounting, and how it might be applied to the subtitle
D program. Members of the public who submitted comments on discounting during the comment period of the local government
financial test need not submit those comments again. If the Agency modifies the subtitle D regulations to allow owners
and operators to discount costs under that program, the Agency will consider all comments related to discounting
that were submitted to the docket for this proposal during the public comment period and to the docket for the local
government financial test proposal during the comment period for that rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

VIII. State Program Approval_Subtitle D 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4005(c) of RCRA requires that each State adopt and implement a ``permit program or other system of prior approval
and conditions'' adequate to assure that each facility that may receive household hazardous waste or small quantity
generator waste will comply with the revised MSWLF criteria. Each state must adopt and implement a permit program
not later than 18 months after October 9, 1991. EPA is required to ``determine whether each State has developed an adequate
program'' pursuant to section 4005(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA plans to propose a State/Tribal implementation rule which will establish adequacy determination requirements
and procedures for State subtitle D permit programs, including submission of a MSWLF permit program application.
EPA also plans to propose to extend eligibility for subtitle D permit program approval to Indian Tribes. The statute,
however, does not require these rules to be in place before EPA assesses the adequacy of any State or Tribal program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of these rules, the Agency plans to include procedures for submitting revised applications for State and Tribal
program adequacy determinations should a State or Tribe revise its permit program once deemed adequate and the appropriate
Regional Administrator determines that a revised application is necessary. Program revision may be necessary when
the pertinent Federal statutory or regulatory authority is changed, when State or Tribal statutory or regulatory
authority or relevant guidance changes, or when responsibility for the State or Tribal program is shifted within
the lead agency or to a new or different State or Tribal agency or agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A State or Tribe that receives permit program approval prior to the final promulgation of today's rule and later elects
to adopt the financial test and local government guarantee mechanisms should work with its respective Regional EPA
office as it proceeds to make changes to its permit program. EPA does not interpret the statute to require that each
and every program change a State or Tribe makes will require a revised permit program application. Rather, only certain
changes that raise issues warranting a detailed review by EPA and an opportunity for public comment will necessitate
a revised application. EPA believes that State and Tribal compliance with today's proposal will, in most cases, not
require a revised permit program application, since this rule merely provides additional options for demonstrating
financial assurance. Furthermore, States and Tribes that have adopted financial assurance requirements without
this local government test and guarantee are not required to take any action and may elect to retain only their current
options since this proposal simply expands the number of options available to owners and operators for demonstrating
financial assurance.

IX. Implementation_Subtitle D 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated above, today's proposal would amend part 258 by adding additional options for corporations to use when demonstrating
financial assurance for the costs of closure, post-closure care and clean-up of known releases. States and Tribes
will not be required to include these options in their MSWLF programs, since they may choose to establish their own
financial assurance programs as long as they meet the financial assurance requirements in Federal criteria. EPA
will be able to approve the financial assurance portion of a State or Tribe's program so long as it includes at least
one of the options promulgated in October, 1991, or added by today's proposal (if promulgated).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a matter of Federal law, these proposed tests (if promulgated) will be potentially available in all States and all
Tribal jurisdictions. EPA cautions owners and operators that wish to use the options in the Federal program that they
should look at the options available under State or Tribal law. If the State or Tribe's rules do not include the option
that the owner or operator wishes to use, the owner or operator would run the risk of being out of compliance with State
or Tribal law. State and Tribal laws for MSWLFs are fully effective even when not approved by EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In unapproved States or Tribes, if State or Tribal law did not preclude the use of options proposed today (either because
it did not include any financial assurance requirements, included only a general requirement that left the choice
of mechanism to the discretion of the owner or operator, or included mechanisms resembling those proposed today)
an owner or operator would be able to use the corporate test or guarantee described in today's proposal (if promulgated)
to satisfy both State or Tribal and Federal law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA notes that States or Tribes seeking approval for the financial assurance portion of their MSWLF program or wishing
to modify an already approved program would have flexibility in adopting Federally promulgated standards. The State
or Tribe could simply adopt the Federal standard or could adopt a mechanism that meets the five performance standards
detailed in the October 9, 1991 final criteria rule. In this case, the mechanism could be used by owners or operators
for demonstrating financial responsibility for their MSWLF obligations in that State or Tribe. The five criteria
that the financial mechanism would need to meet are the following: (1) Ensure that the amount of funds assured is sufficient
to cover the costs of closure, post-closure care, and corrective action for known releases when needed; (2) ensure
that funds will be available in a timely fashion when needed; (3) guarantee the availability of the required amount
of coverage from the effective date of these requirements or prior to the initial receipt of waste, whichever is later,
until the owner or operator is released from financial assurance requirements under &sect;&sect;253.32 (f), (g),
(h); (4) provide flexibility to the owner or operator for demonstrating compliance with financial assurance requirements;
and (5) be legally valid, binding, and enforceable under State and Federal law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result, while the Agency is developing financial tests that are designed to meet these performance criteria (the
financial test proposed in this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and the financial test proposed on December 27, 1993 (58 FR 68353)), approved States and Tribes could develop their
own financial tests that could be used by owners and operators of MSWLFs within those States and Tribes for demonstrating
financial responsibility as long as those tests are determined to have met the performance standards. (For a discussion
of the effect of EPA's approval of a State or Tribal program on the Federal regulations, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
56 FR 50995.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Owners and operators who can use the options in today's proposal under State or Tribal law would be required to maintain
appropriate documentation of the mechanism in the facility's operating record. They would not be required by Federal
law to submit that documentation to the State or Tribe, but only to notify the State or Tribal Director that the required
items have been placed in the operating record. Owners and operators using the financial test or guarantee would also
be required to update all required financial test information on an annual basis, and retain this information in their
operating records. In addition, an owner or operator (or guarantor) that becomes unable to meet the financial test
criteria would be required to notify the State or Tribal Director and establish alternate financial assurance within
specified deadlines. Finally, in order to cancel a guarantee, the guarantor would have to notify both the State or
Tribal Director and the owner or operator at least 120 days prior to cancellation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes that most Tribes have an accounting structure similar or identical to those of most local governments.
Tribes that meet the requirements of the local government financial test would be eligible to use that financial test
to demonstrate financial responsibility for their subtitle D obligations to the extent that they meet the provisions
of that test. However, the Agency recognizes that there may be Tribes and local government units that use an accounting
system similar or identical to those of most corporations. Those Tribes and local government units would be eligible
to use this proposed corporate financial test to demonstrate financial responsibility for their subtitle D obligations
to the extent that they meet the requirements of this proposal.

X. State Authorization_Subtitle C 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 1, 1991, the Agency proposed revisions to the subtitle C corporate financial test (56 FR 30201). In that proposal,
the Agency considered the effect of those proposed revisions on State Authorization based on the entire test, rather
than on the individual components of the entire financial test (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
56 FR 30214 and 30215). This proposal would modify one provision of that July 1, 1991 proposed rule. Specifically,
this proposal would modify the domestic assets requirement of the financial test contained in &sect;&sect;264.143(f)(1)
(i)(D) and (ii)(D); 265.143(e)(1) (i)(D) and (ii)(D); 264.145(f)(1) (i)(D) and (ii)(D); 265.145(e)(1) (i)(D)
and (ii)(D); 264.147(f)(1) (i)(D) and (ii)(D); and 265.147(f)(1) (i)(D) and (ii)(D) and the corresponding revisions
to the financial test instruments at &sect;264.151 (f) and (g). This proposed change of the domestic asset requirement
would not change the effect of State Authorization detailed in the July 1, 1991 proposed rule. As a result, if the Agency
does promulgate a revised financial test under subtitle C, the effect on State Authorization would be based on the
July 1, 1991 proposal, though a full discussion of the effect on State Authorization of the entire revised subtitle
C corporate financial test will be contained in the final rule.

A. Executive Order 12866

Under Executive Order 12866, which was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 58 FR 51735), the Agency must determine whether a regulatory action is ``significant'' and, therefore, subject to
OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one
that is likely to result in a rule that may: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a
sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local,
or Tribal governments or communities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the terms of Executive Order 12866, OMB has notified EPA that it considers this a ``significant regulatory action''
within the meaning of the Executive Order. EPA has submitted this action to OMB for review. Changes made in response
to OMB suggestions or recommendations are documented in the public record for this rulemaking (

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency conducted an analysis to estimate the costs that would be avoided by corporations if this corporate financial
test were available to them. Since corporations would be able to use the financial test for all or part of their subtitle
D obligations, corporations would save the cost of obtaining a third-party instrument for those portions of their
obligations. The Agency estimates that the corporate financial test and guarantee mechanisms would save corporations
$45 million annually. In performing this analysis, the Agency assumed that the 1991 data used to estimate the number
of MSWLFs, the costs of closure and post-closure care for each of the categories of MSWLFs, and the number of corporations
are held constant. The financial data of the corporations are also assumed not to have changed since 1991. The Agency
also assumed that corporations had, as their only environmental obligations, the costs of closure, post-closure
care of their MSWLFs. The Agency further assumed that the cost of obtaining a third-party financial instrument, such
as a letter of credit or surety bond, would be 1.5 percent of the cost estimate of closure and post-closure care of the
MSWLF. Finally, the Agency assumed that corporate parents would be willing to provide guarantees to their subsidiaries
to the extent that they are able to provide those guarantees through the financial test. A full discussion of this analysis
can be found in the docket for this rulemaking.

The Agency believes that the information it had when it performed its analysis was the most current and the most complete
at the time. While the Agency recognizes that changes have occurred in the subtitle D universe since 1991, it does not
have information to quantify these changes. As a result, the Agency solicits the public for more current information
that can be used to update its analysis. Further, the Agency solicits comment on the assumptions made in order to perform
the analysis and solicits the public for information that supports or refutes these assumptions. A detailed analysis
of the cost savings associated with this rule is available in the docket.

 at the time an Agency publishes a proposed or final rule, it generally must prepare a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
that describes the impact of the rule on small entities, unless the Administrator certifies that the rule will not
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The Agency is aware of three companies
that would be excluded from using this proposed financial test because their net worth is less than $10 million. Therefore,
pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605b, we believe that this regulation will not have a significant impact on a substantial number
of small entities.

 and assigned OMB control number 2050&hyph;0122. The burden estimate for the MSWLF financial assurance provisions
included the burden associated with a landfill obtaining and maintaining any one of the allowable financial assurance
instruments, including a financial test. The proposed revision to part 264 does not change the recordkeeping or reporting
requirements for subtitle C facilities. The information collection requirements for financial assurance of subtitle
C facilities are discussed and approved under OMB control number 2050&hyph;0120.

) To be eligible to use the financial test, the owner's or operator's financial statements referenced in paragraph
(e)(2) of this section must receive an unqualified opinion from the independent certified public accountant. An
adverse opinion, disclaimer of opinion, or other qualified opinion will be cause for disallowance. The Director
of an approved State may evaluate qualified opinions on a case by case basis and allow use of the financial test in cases
where the Director deems that the matters which form the basis for the qualification are insufficient to warrant disallowance
of the test. If the Director of an approved State does not allow use of the test, the owner or operator must provide alternate
financial assurance as specified in this section.

the chief financial officer's letter should be adjusted.

(ii) An owner or operator must place the items specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this section in the operating record
and notify the State Director that these items have been placed in the operating record before the initial receipt
of waste or before the effective date of this section, whichever is later, in the case of closure, post-closure care,
or no later than 120 days after the corrective action remedy has been selected in accordance with the requirements
of &sect;258.58. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) After the initial placement of items specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this section in the operating record,
the owner or operator must update the information and place updated information in the operating record within 90
days following the close of the owner or operator's fiscal year. This information must consist of all three items specified
in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The owner or operator is no longer required to submit the items specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this section when:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) He substitutes alternate financial assurance as specified in this section; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) He is released from the requirements of this section in accordance with &sect;258.71(b), &sect;258.72(b), or
&sect;258.73(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) If the owner or operator no longer meets the requirements of paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the owner or operator
must, within 120 days following the close of the owner or operator's fiscal year, obtain alternative financial assurance
that meets the requirements of this section, place the required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submissions for that assurance in the operating record, and notify the State Director that the owner or operator no
longer meets the criteria of the financial test and that alternate assurance has been obtained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) The Director of an approved State may, based on a reasonable belief that the owner or operator may no longer meet
the requirements of paragraph (e)(1) of this section, require at any time the owner or operator to provide current
financial test documentation as specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. If the Director of an approved State
finds that the owner or operator no longer meets the requirements of paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the owner or
operator must provide alternate financial assurance as specified in this section.

When calculating the ``current cost estimates for closure, post-closure care, corrective action, or the sum of the
combination of such costs to be covered, and any other environmental obligations assured by a financial test'' referred
to in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the owner or operator must include cost estimates required for municipal solid
waste management facilities under this part, as well as cost estimates required for the following environmental
obligations, if it assures them through a financial test: obligations associated with UIC facilities under 40 CFR
144.62, petroleum underground storage tank facilities under 40 CFR part 280, PCB storage facilities under 40 CFR
part 761, and hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities under 40 CFR parts 264 and 265.

Corporate Guarantee.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

must be the direct or higher-tier parent corporation of the owner or operator, a firm whose parent corporation is also
the parent corporation of the owner or operator, or a firm with a ``substantial business relationship'' with the owner
or operator. The guarantor must meet the requirements for owners or operators in paragraph (e) of this section and
must comply with the terms of the guarantee. A certified copy of the guarantee must be placed in the facility's operating
record along with copies of the letter from the guarantor's chief financial officer and accountants' opinions as
specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. If the guarantor's parent corporation is also the parent corporation
of the owner or operator, the letter from the guarantor's chief financial officer must describe the value received
in consideration of the guarantee. If the guarantor is a firm with a ``substantial business relationship'' with the
owner or operator, this letter must describe this ``substantial business relationship'' and the value received
in consideration of the guarantee.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) The guarantee must be effective and all required submissions placed in the operating record before the initial
receipt of waste or before the effective date of this section, whichever is later, in the case of closure and post-closure
care, or no later than 120 days after the corrective action remedy has been selected in accordance with the requirements
of &sect;258.58. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (3) The terms of the guarantee must provide that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (i) If the owner or operator fails to perform closure, post-closure care, and/or corrective action of a facility covered
by the guarantee, the guarantor will: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 (B) Establish a fully funded trust fund as specified in paragraph (a) of this section in the name of the owner or operator
(payment guarantee). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (ii) The guarantee will remain in force unless the guarantor sends prior notice of cancellation by certified mail
to the owner or operator and to the State Director. Cancellation may not occur, however, during the 120 days beginning
on the date of receipt of the notice of cancellation by both the owner or operator and the State Director, as evidenced
by the return receipts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (iii) If a guarantee is cancelled, the owner or operator must, within 90 days following receipt of the cancellation
notice by the owner or operator and the State Director, obtain alternate financial assurance, place evidence of that
alternate financial assurance in the facility operating record, and notify the State Director. If the owner or operator
fails to provide alternate financial assurance within the 90-day period, the guarantor must provide that alternate
assurance within 120 days, obtain alternative assurance, place evidence of the alternate assurance in the facility
operating record, and notify the State Director. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (4) If a corporate guarantor no longer meets the requirements of paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the owner or operator

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (i) The owner or operator substitutes alternate financial assurance as specified in this section; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
These proposed regulations incorporate additional statutory disregards in the rules for the Aid to Families With
Dependent Children (AFDC) program and the adult assistance programs in Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.
Included is the income disregard provided under section 13736 of Pub. L. 103&hyph;66, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1993, which amends section 8 of Pub. L. 93&hyph;134. This income disregard is effective January 1, 1994. This
amendment provides that up to $2,000 per year of income derived from interests of individual Indians in trust or restricted
lands shall not be considered in determining assistance under the Social Security Act or any other Federal or federally
assisted program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Additionally, we propose to incorporate the resource disregard provided under section 8 of Pub. L. 93&hyph;134,
as added by section 4 of Pub. L. 97&hyph;458, effective January 12, 1983. This provision requires that interests of
individual Indians in trust or restricted lands shall not be considered a resource in determining eligibility for
assistance under the Social Security Act or any other Federal or federally assisted program.

Disregard of Certain Income Derived From Interests of Individual Indians in Trust or Restricted Lands
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Effective January 1, 1994, section 13736 of Pub. L. 103&hyph;66, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, amends
section 8 of Pub. L. 93&hyph;134 to provide that up to $2,000 per year of amounts derived from interests of individual
Indians in trust or restricted lands shall not be counted as income. The Conference Report identifies ``leases on
individually-owned trust or restricted Indian lands'' as such interests [H.R. Rep. No. 103&hyph;111, 103D Cong.,
1st Sess., 494&hyph;495 (1993)]. The income generally comes from interests in lands allotted to individual Indians
many years ago. Income to individual Indians generated by these interests is likely to be quite small because many
of the original interests is allotted lands have fractionized over time due to the inheritance of multiple heirs over
several generations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed regulations, the disregard of up to $2,000 per year would be applicable only to income. Any disregarded
amounts retained by an individual after the month in which they are received would be counted as a resource. We also
propose to give States the flexibility to define the yearly period for applying the income disregard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 233.20 would be amended by redesignating paragraph (a)(4)(i) as (a)(4)(i)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and adding a new paragraph (a)(4)(i)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) to incorporate the income disregard required by section 8 of Pub. L. 93&hyph;134, as amended.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Disregard of Individual Indian Interests in Trust or Restricted Lands From Consideration as a Resource
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Public Law 93&hyph;134, enacted October 19, 1973, provides for the use or distribution of certain Indian judgment
funds. Public Law 97&hyph;458, enacted January 12, 1983, made several amendments to Pub. L. 93&hyph;134. One amendment
made by section 4 of Pub. L. 97&hyph;458 was the addition of a new section 8 to Pub. L. 93&hyph;134. Section 8 of Pub. L.
93&hyph;134 requires that interests of individual Indians in trust or restricted lands shall not be considered a
resource in determining eligibility for assistance under the Social Security Act of any other Federal or federally
assisted program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although this provision was effective in 1983, it was not incorporated in the regulations at that time because it was
considered unnecessary. Interests in trust or restricted lands are not considered a resource under the definition
of available income and resources in existing regulations at 45 CFR 233.20(a)(3)(ii)(D). These regulations provide,
in pertinent part, that income and resources are considered available both when actually available and when the applicant
or recipient has a legal interest in a liquidated sum and has the legal ability to make such sum available for support
and maintenance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, we now propose to incorporate the resource disregard in order to prevent any confusion that may result were
we to incorporate only the income disregard provided under section 13736 of Pub. L. 103&hyph;66. Therefore, we would
further amend section 233.20 by adding paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
v
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) to incorporate the resource disregard required by section 8 of Pub. L. 93&hyph;134, as added by section 4 of Pub. L.
97&hyph;458.

Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12866 requires that regulations be reviewed to ensure that they are consistent with the priorities
and principles set forth in the Executive Order. The Department has determined that this rule is consistent with these
priorities and principles. An assessment of the costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives (including
not regulating) demonstrated that the approach taken in the regulation is the most cost-effective and least burdensome
while still achieving the regulatory objectives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total Federal and State cost for implementing this statutory amendment is estimated to be $10.6 million for the
first full year with $5.8 million (55.2%) of this amount being the Federal share. Assuming that the number of additional
Indian families becoming eligible for AFDC after the first year is an added 10 percent, then an added cost of $0.6 million
is estimated for a total Federal cost of $6.4 million. These costs result from the statutory requirements and not from
decisions made in the proposed rule.

We certify that these regulations will not have significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because
they primarily affect State governments and individuals. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis as provided
in Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, is not required.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission adopted this Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) to make minor modifications to its procedural rules
governing informal complaints against common carriers and to seek comment on the proposed rules. The NPRM proposes
rules that would modify certain filing and notice requirements and clarifies the role of carriers in informal complaint
proceedings. These proposals are intended to help the general public in preparing written informal complaints,
improve the procedure by which informal complaints are handled by the staff, harness staff resources to resolve informal
complaints more efficiently, and eliminate unnecessary filings of formal complaints prior to the disposition of
informal complaints.

Summary of Notice of Proposed Rule Making
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. On August 11, 1994, the Commission adopted a Notice of Proposed Rule Making in CC Docket No. 94&hyph;93 (released
September 2, 1994: FCC 94&hyph;211) in order to make minor modifications to our procedural rules governing informal
complaints against carriers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The NPRM proposes to amend &sect;1.716 to clarify that informal complaints may be filed against common carriers
for violations of the Commission's rules or orders as well as the Communications Act. This proposal is intended to
conform &sect;1.716 to Section 208 of the Communications Act. The NPRM also proposes to amend &sect;1.716 to require
specifically that informal complaints include factual allegations that, if assumed to be true, would support a finding
that the subject carrier has violated a provision of the Communications Act or Commission rules or orders. This proposal
should provide helpful guidance to the general public in preparing written informal complaints, enable FCC staff
to assess the merits of complaints more quickly, and aid carriers in their efforts to answer or satisfy informal complaints.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. In addition, the NPRM proposes to amend &sect;1.716 to add a new subsection (b) to encourage complainants to file
both an original informal complaint as well as one copy for each carrier named in their informal complaints. The NPRM
also proposes to amend &sect;1.716 by adding subsection (c) which would encourage complainants to file a copy of the
pertinent bill(s) when the complaint involves a billing dispute. Multiple copies of informal complaints are intended
to reduce the clerical burden in preparing complaints for processing. In addition, encouraging complainants to
file a copy of pertinent bills should enable the Commission to reassign substantial resources from administrative
functions to enforcement functions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The NPRM also proposes to amend &sect;1.717 to conform the rules to Commission practices. Specifically, the NPRM
clarifies that the function of carriers in informal complaint proceedings is to satisfy or answer written allegations
contained in a complaint. In addition, the NPRM proposes to eliminate the Commission's discretion to close certain
informal complaints without further contact with the carrier and the complainant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Finally, the NPRM proposes to amend &sect;1.718 to state that in all cases involving an unsatisfied informal complaint,
the period of time allowed for filing a formal complaint that will relate back to the filing date of the informal complaint
is sixty days after the staff has informed the parties in writing of its disposition of the informal complaint. The
proposal is intended to eliminate the need for complainants to calculate the deadline for filing formal complaints
based on unsatisfied informal complaints and relieve the burden on carriers of determining when they may dispose
of informal complaint files.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 603, it is certified that the proposed rule will not,
if promulgated, have a significant impact on a substantial number of small business entities, as defined by Section
601(3) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Although the proposed rules change the timing and mechanics of the informal
complaint process, they would not alter the level of evidentiary and legal support required of parties to such actions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. This notice and comment rule making procedure is nonrestricted. Section 1.1206(a) of the Commission's Rules,
47 CFR 1.1206(a), contains provisions governing permissible

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. It is further ordered, pursuant to &sect;&sect;1.415 and 1.419 of the Commission's Rules, 47 CFR 1.415, 1.419,
that all interested parties may file comments on the matters discussed in the Notice and on the proposed rules as set
forth below by October 24, 1994 and reply comments by November 8, 1994. All relevant and timely comments will be considered
by the Commission before final action is taken in this proceeding. To file formally in this proceeding, participants
must file an original and four copies of all comments, reply comments, and supporting comments. If participants wish
each Commissioner to have a personal copy of their comments, an original plus nine copies must be filed. Comments and

to the complainant, of its satisfaction of the complaint or of its refusal or inability to do so. In all cases, the Commission
will contact the complainant and the carrier(s) regarding its review and disposition of the matters raised. If the
complainant is not satisfied by the carrier's response and the Commission's disposition, it may file a formal complaint
in accordance with &sect;&sect;1.718 and 1.721.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Is filed within sixty (60) days after the date the Commission's written notification to the complainant of the
Commission's review and disposition of the informal complaint is mailed;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 The Commonwealth of Kentucky, lead State for the ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 Program, and Heavy Vehicle Electronic License
Plate, Inc. (HELP) have requested, and the FHWA proposes to grant, a petition for a waiver from the requirements of
the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs) to allow the use of an automatic vehicle identification (AVI)
transponder to be mounted near the upper border at the approximate center of the windshields of commercial motor vehicles.
The FHWA proposes to grant the waiver to allow the use of the transponders in a maximum of 30,000 commercial motor vehicles
participating in the ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 ``beta tests'' and the HELP corridor programs during a 3-year period, subject
to the proposed conditions described in this notice.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) are required to stop at highway ports of entry (POE), weigh stations, and other checkpoints
to be weighed and to have their regulatory credentials (e.g., registration, operating permits) checked by State
officials. A CMV may be stopped many times in the course of a single trip. Each stop can add a minimum of 15 to 20 minutes
to the length of a trip because of the time needed to decelerate, stop, be weighed, have paperwork reviewed, undergo
a safety inspection, reenter the highway, and accelerate to mainline speed.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
CMVs that are in compliance with safety and size and weight regulations and have their administrative paperwork in
order have an opportunity to greatly increase inspection efficiency and effectiveness. Information on the status
of a CMV's registration, safety inspection, and operating permits, can be encoded and transmitted to the POE as an
electronic signal via an automatic vehicle identification (AVI) transponder carried in the CMV. The POE's receiver
would decode the signal, and officials would review the CMV's status on the spot. Drivers whose CMVs' safety status
or administrative records needed to be reviewed would receive a signal to enter the POE or weigh station. Drivers whose
CMVs are in compliance may receive a signal to bypass the site. However, they may still be required to enter for a safety
inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The outcome would be a more selective review process which would enable POE officials to focus their resources to deal
with vehicles with safety and size and weight infractions or vehicles that are not in compliance with other administrative
requirements. Use of AVI transponders would also provide economic benefits by saving motor carriers time, improving
the efficiency and effectiveness of enforcement, reducing paperwork, and increasing uniformity of enforcement.
Environmental benefits would be gained from fuel savings and reduced CMV emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The goals of the ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 and the HELP programs are to reduce congestion, increase efficiency, and enhance
the safety of users of major highway corridors through the application of a network of advanced highway, vehicle,
and communications technologies. Both programs are multi-State partnerships of public and private sector interests.
ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75, currently in progress, and HELP/CRESCENT, completed in late 1993, were two of the first in a
planned series of operational tests within the Commercial Vehicle Operations (CVO) element of the Intelligent Transportation
System (ITS) Program (formerly known as the Intelligent Vehicle-Highway Systems (IVHS) program). HELP builds on
the foundation of the multistate, multinational CRESCENT research effort to design and test a heavy vehicle monitoring
system that integrates automatic vehicle identification, classification, and weigh-in-motion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 and HELP programs will allow CMVs which are equipped with transponders, and which are in compliance
with safety and administrative requirements, to travel any segment of their respective instrumented highways at
mainline speeds with minimal stopping at weight/inspection checkpoints. For ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75, electronic
clearance decisions at points along the corridor will be based on the information obtained at the point on the corridor
where the vehicle first enters, as well as on computerized checking of operating credentials and safety records in
each State. For HELP, the electronic clearance decisions will be based on data collected from weigh-in-motion devices
embedded in the mainline highway pavement or on bypass ramps, as well as on computerized checking of operating credentials
and safety records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 covers the entire length of I&hyph;75 and Canadian Highway 401 (Ontario). The HELP/CRESCENT
demonstration operated along the I&hyph;5 and I&hyph;10 corridors in several western States from Washington to
Texas. Under HELP, the former CRESCENT highway corridors are being expanded to include segments in Utah and Colorado.

AVI Device 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The AVI device proposed for use in both programs is an electronic transponder designed to send and receive signals
from a CMV to POEs and safety inspection sites. The signals contain information such as the identity of the motor carrier,
the gross weight of the vehicle, and the status of the vehicle's registration and fuel tax payments. The transponder
only transmits when it is in the immediate vicinity of a licensed transmitter and is directed to do so by that licensed
transmitter under the provisions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
47 CFR 90.239. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When an inspection official decides whether the vehicle should enter or bypass the POE, a signal is transmitted from
the official's workstation to the CMV. This is displayed to the CMV driver in the form of a clearly visible signal from
red and green lamps on the transponder's face. The transponder also provides an audible signal to the driver. The transponder
measures 3.3 inches (84 mm) high by 4.4 inches (112 mm) wide by 1.5 inches (38 mm) deep.

In order to function effectively, the transponder must be able properly to transmit and receive signals from the POE.
The physical location of the transponder is a critical factor in its operation because CMVs are equipped with many
other devices that transmit and receive electronic signals of varying strengths and frequencies, such as electronic
engine monitors and citizens-band radios which could affect the transponder's transmissions. In addition to these
internally-generated signals, there is also a possibility of external interference from electrical power transmission
lines running along highway rights-of-way. Furthermore, the device must be placed to allow drivers to read the enter/bypass
indication displayed on the transponder so they can respond appropriately.

Documentation of Device 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The AVI transponder is clearly labelled in its lower right-hand quadrant, on the side facing the driver, with the name
of the respective issuing program (``ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 Driver Communications Module'' and ``PRE-PASS, a transportation
solution from HELP, Inc.''). Two indicators, a red octagonal mark labeled ``STOP'' and a green upward-pointing arrow
labeled ``GO,'' also appear on that side. A nine-pin RS&hyph;232 connector, not used for either the ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75
or the HELP application, is on the bottom of the transponder. The device is thus readily identifiable as a transponder
issued by one of the two programs, and no additional documentation need be carried on the participating CMVs. The transponder's
unique configuration and marking distinguish it from other electronic devices, such as radar detectors.

The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Recommended Practices are the standard automotive design guidelines
originally developed for use by automotive manufacturers and their suppliers. They provide a common language for
vehicle and component design and the accommodation of drivers. While the use of the SAE Recommended Practices is voluntary,
many, if not most, of them are adopted by automotive manufacturers.

A foundation reference for defining the ergonomic basis for cab design is ``Motor Vehicle Driver's Eye Range,'' SAE
Recommended Practice (RP) J941, which establishes two-dimensional ``Eyellipses'' representing the 90th, 95th,
and 99th percentile distributions of driver eye locations for use in the design of the passenger cars, trucks, buses,
and multipurpose passenger vehicles. This RP was initially approved in October 1965, and completely revised in October
1985. It has been recognized as an American National Standard by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).
A method for describing and measuring the driver's direct and indirect field of view, presented in SAE RP J1050a, references
RP J941. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Uniform test procedures for minimum performance of windshield wiper systems for trucks, buses, and multipurpose
vehicles are established in SAE RP J198. This RP also references RP J941 for a statistical representation of the driver's
eye location, except for head-turn considerations. The RP states that the specific areas on the windshield glazing
surface ``were developed as being compatible with viewing requirements necessary to operate the types of vehicles
listed in Table 1 [of the RP]''. The classification lists seven different types of vehicles, and the corresponding
areas described by the intersections of planes defined by angles above, below, left, and right of the horizontal axis
of the Eyellipse. The RP defines 3 areas: a central zone, Area C, an intermediate zone, Area B, and an outer zone, Area
A; all are delimited by the angles listed in Table 1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``angle up'' for the outer zone of the windshield, Area A, ranges from 10 degrees for a cab-behind-engine configuration

from 6 to 8 degrees. Angles-up for Areas B and C range from 1 to 5 degrees.

The upper, lower, extreme left, and extreme right borders of the windshield are outside areas A, B, and C. The minimum
percentage of required wiped area described in the RP decreases from the central to the outer zones. If installed as
proposed, that is, within the upper windshield border, the transponder should be located well outside Areas A, B,
and C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed transponder location would be near the top center of a one-piece windshield or on the passenger side of
a multipiece windshield. This would place it well outside the area swept by wipers pivoting from below the windshield.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SAE RP J382, Windshield Defrosting Systems Performance Guidelines_Trucks, Buses, and Multi-Purpose Vehicles,
provides a defrosting system performance guideline. Among other things, it notes that the windshield area to be defrosted
``was developed to be compatible with vision requirements necessary to operate trucks, buses, and multi passenger
vehicles.'' This windshield area is based on SAE RP J941, March 1981 (Eyellipse), and SAE RP J826, April 1980 (Devices
for Use in Defining and Measuring Vehicle Seating Accommodation). In a fashion similar to RP 198, this RP defines two
areas: a central zone, Area C, and a surrounding zone, Area A. Angles up, down, left, and right are also defined, as in
RP 198. The upper, lower, extreme left, and extreme right borders of the windshield are outside both of these areas.
If installed as proposed, that is, within the upper windshield border, the transponder should be located well outside
Areas A and C, as defined in this RP.

Research on Driver's Field of View 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Four recent research papers discuss the issue of a driver's useful field of view (FOV). The first, ``A Study of Driver's
Forward Fields of Direct View for Large Trucks,'' (N. Nagaike and Y. Hoshino, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
JSAE Review,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 January 1989, pages 74&hyph;76), reviewed factors governing the visible area directly ahead of large trucks. The
research determined necessary visibility areas, depicted by vertical and lateral angles in a driver's forward field
of view. Factors for determining these areas included locations of traffic lights and directional signs, the driver's
ability to recognize stationary and moving objects, and the braking deceleration of large trucks. Data were collected
from traffic accident records in Japan and from direct observation. While the visible area for traffic signals and
road signs was recorded at angles above the driver's eye level, stationary objects, moving objects in the vicinity
of intersections, and oncoming vehicles and vehicles in front of the CMV were shown to be located in visible areas below
the driver's eye level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A second paper, ``Research on Forward Field of View of Trucks,'' (Y. Siosaka and N. Nagaike, 14th Annual Technical
Conference on Enhanced Safety of Vehicles, Munich, Germany, May 1994), presented a study undertaken to determine
the minimum forward field of view required for driving in a straight line, in order more clearly to define the area swept
by windshield wipers. Data on braking distance and merging behavior (specifically, gap acceptance) were collected
from drivers driving on Japanese rural roads, urban streets, and expressways. The results indicated a ``driveable
field of view'' extending from 5 degrees above horizontal to 5 degrees below horizontal, referenced to the driver's
eye point centerline.

Design conflicts between the need for driver visual perspective and windshield optical distortion were examined
by Makiguchi, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (``A Human Factors Analysis of Optical Distortion for Automotive Windshields,'' SAE Paper 940390, 1994). Field
data were gathered during straight-line driving. Based on drivers' fixation frequency and the type of objects observed,
the windshield was divided into four zones. The G1 zone, with the highest fixation frequency, extended 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 17 degrees laterally and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 8 degrees vertically from the driver's line of sight. It included crucial driving information, such as pedestrians,
road signs and signals, and oncoming and nearby vehicles. The fixation frequency was reported as exceeding 95 percent.
The G3 and G4 zones, with the lowest fixation frequencies, were noted at approximately 100 to 200 mm from the edge of
the windshield's visible area. Drivers observe pedestrians and buildings in the zone below 8 degrees horizontal;
in the zone above 8 degrees horizontal, they see the sky. A zone of middle fixation frequency, G2, was defined as the
area outside the G1, G3, and G4 zones. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety published a report on accidents in four urban areas arising in
part from visibility problems in heavy trucks (``A Study of Fatal Crashes Involving Pedestrians and Trucks in Four
Cities,'' December 1992). It noted, ``Obstruction of truck driver visibility, caused by the design of truck/tractor
cabs, appears to be a major contributing factor in crashes at intersections.'' However, the discussion of accident
data did not differentiate between conventional_cab behind engine_and cab-over-engine tractor involvement.
The report did not mention decals or other items in CMV windshields as a potential concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reviewing the reports on these studies, the FHWA believes that the location of a transponder device near the
upper margin of a CMV's windshield is unlikely to have any effect on a driver's ability to observe nearby objects, such
as pedestrians. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Relationship to Sunvisors, Sunshades, and Rear-View Mirrors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interior sunvisors are standard equipment in virtually every vehicle on the road today. Exterior sunshades are available
as optional accessories from several truck manufacturers. Sunvisors are not regulated by an FMVSS or an FMCSR, nor
is there an SAE Recommended Practice concerning their design. Sunvisors are not believed to have a detrimental effect
on a driver's safety-related vision. On the contrary, blocking the sun's glare offers a clear safety benefit, and
the loss of a small visible area of the windshield, well outside the range of the driver's field of view, is considered
an acceptable tradeoff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Data obtained on 33 models of new Class 8 tractor cabs, representing all seven of the major manufacturers serving the
U.S. market, indicate that sunvisors vary from 5.25 to 7.5 inches in height and 19.75 to 34 inches in length. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency notes that the AVI transponder proposed to be used in ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 and HELP is roughly 2 inches smaller
than the smallest sunvisor (which was only found on one cab model). The agency therefore believes that a transponder
mounted within the region of the windshield that the sunvisor would cover would be extremely unlikely to have an adverse
effect on safety. The audible indicator that accompanies the visible signal for the driver to enter or to bypass a POE
would provide the necessary information in the event that a sunvisor were to block the driver's view of the transponder.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For windshields equipped with exterior sunshades, the transponder is likely to fall at or above the portion of the
underside of the sunshade visible from the cab interior. Furthermore, while exterior sunshades may limit the uppermost
range of the driver's available field of view, that area is also well out of the useful field of view as reported by the
research cited above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency also notes that the AVI transponder would be located in approximately the same relative position in the
windshield of a CMV as that of a rear-view mirror in a passenger car. The agency believes that the transponder would
have no more impact on safety than the presence of such a mirror and its mounting.

History: Rule on Vision-Reducing Matter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 393.60(c) of the FMCSRs requires that no motor vehicle be operated with any label, sticker, decalcomania,
or other vision-reducing matter covering any portion of its windshield or windows at either side of the driver's compartment,
except that stickers required by law may be affixed to the bottom of the windshield, provided that no portion of any
label, sticker, decalcomania, or other vision-reducing matter may extend upward more than 4.5 inches from the bottom
of the windshield. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A regulation dealing with Glazing and Window Construction, issued by order of the Interstate Commerce Commission
(ICC) in 1952 [54 Motor Carrier Cases 337, 7 FR 4422, May 15, 1952], required that glazing in specified openings conform
to the requirements contained in the ``American Standard Safety Code for Safety Glazing Materials for Glazing Motor
Vehicles Operating on Land Highways, Z26.1 1950'' of the American Standards Association, now called the American
National Standards Institute (ANSI). (The Table of Glazing Requirements, contained in &sect;393.60(a)(2) of the
FMCSRs, requires CMVs manufactured on and after January 1, 1981, to comply with Z26.1&hyph;1966 as supplemented
by Z26.1a-1969.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In December 1958 (23 FR 9608, December 11, 1958), the ICC proposed to amend this rule, then codified at 49 CFR &sect;193.60,
by adding paragraphs covering windshield condition (&sect;193.60(b)) and use of vision-reducing matter (&sect;193.60(c)).
The latter paragraph prohibited the use of vision-reducing matter covering any portion of a motor vehicle's windshield
or windows at either side of the driver's compartment, ``except 1 vehicle-inspection sticker issued by a State or
municipal authority, which shall be no larger than 3 inches by 5 inches and shall be located in the lower right-hand
corner of the windshield.'' The ICC invited comment, but did not publish a report on this proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 3, 1959 (24 FR 9674), the ICC adopted a final rule amending &sect;193.60(c) to remove the maximum dimension
requirement for the sticker while setting a limit of one sticker indicating compliance with official mechanical
inspection requirements of the State in which the title or certificate of ownership is registered. The permissible
location was changed to ``a lower corner of the windshield.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The language of &sect;193.60(c) was amended again on April 19, 1961 (26 FR 3309), based on petitions for reconsideration
from the Virginia State Police, the New York State Public Service Commission, and the American Association of Motor
Vehicle Administrators. The resulting amendment relaxed the rule to permit more than one label, sticker, or decalcomania
to be displayed, and added the requirement that no portion of any label, sticker, decalcomania, or other vision-reducing
matter may extend upward more than 4.5 inches from the bottom of such windshield. While the ICC did not provide an explanation
for the selection of a 4.5 inch dimension, most inspection decals range from 3.5 to 4 inches in size, and the dimension
was apparently chosen to allow for variations in the application of stickers and decalcomania. (The water-activated
adhesives used for decalcomania prior to the availability of self-stick adhesives in the early 1960's tended to make
them somewhat difficult to position.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements of &sect;393.60, particularly the 4.5 inch limit specified &sect;393.60(c), are independent
of the physical dimensions of windshields. CMV design has made significant strides since the time the regulation
was promulgated, in part because of research leading to a better understanding of driver anthropometry and ergonomics.
Improved positioning of driving controls, availability of more effective mirrors, enhanced adjustability of seats,
and larger CMV windshields are just a few of the design advances made since the 1950's and 1960's. However, the requirements
of &sect;393.60(c) have not kept pace.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To evaluate the performance and usability of the transponders, it was necessary to assess various locations for mounting
the devices during an initial on-the-road ``alpha test.'' Plans called for the transponders to be mounted near the
upper and lower borders of the windshields of CMV cabs. Approximately 200 vehicles, representing six motor carriers'
fleets, were to be equipped with electronic transponders to transmit and receive information from CMV weigh stations
and ports of entry.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although placing the transponders in the windshield was considered the best solution from an engineering standpoint,
some of the locations would have conflicted with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;393.60(c). The proposed lower-border transponder location would have been just within the border area permitted
under this section. However, the upper-border location would have been in violation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 11, 1993, Don C. Kelly, Secretary of Transportation for the Commonwealth of Kentucky and Chairman of the
ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 Policy Committee, wrote to the FHWA, requesting a waiver of &sect;393.60(c) for the purpose
of conducting the alpha test of these AVI transponders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 15, 1993, the FHWA responded that the agency would not apply, or require the States to apply, &sect;393.60(c)
to vehicles, drivers and motor carriers participating in the alpha test from November 15, 1993, to January 21, 1994,
or whenever the test ended, whichever was earlier. (The alpha test was originally scheduled to run during this period.
Because of poor weather and a number of engineering changes to the transponder and the roadside communications devices,
the start of the test was delayed until March 7, 1994, and the agency's enforcement moratorium was extended, first
until August 31, 1994, and eventually to March 31, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In granting temporary relief from the requirements of &sect;393.60(c), the FHWA expressly recognized the need for
good visibility, but acknowledged that the alpha test was a short-duration trial involving a small number of trucks.
The FHWA also noted that participating motor carriers were volunteers that agreed to provide their drivers with thorough
orientation and training on the use of the AVI devices, that the drivers had participated in focus groups in preparation
for these tests, and that they were made particularly aware of the need for objective evaluations of any problems,
including reduced visibility, caused by the placement of the transponders. Because there would have been no way to
conduct a real-world evaluation of AVI technology without operating in conflict with &sect;393.60(c), the FHWA
decided not to require the enforcement of that provision for the brief period needed to gather data in preparation
for the exhaustive beta phase of the test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a condition of this temporary relief from enforcement of the provisions of &sect;393.60(c), the FHWA required
that the AVI transponder be mounted outside the area swept by the vehicle's windshield wipers, or outside the driver's
sight lines to the road and highway signs or signals. The following conditions also had to be met: (1) a copy of the letter
granting the temporary relief was to be carried in each motor vehicle used in the AVI alpha test program; and (2) a letter
from the Commonwealth of Kentucky, on official letterhead, clearly identifying any vehicle involved in the AVI alpha
test program, was to be carried in that vehicle. If any of the participating vehicles were stopped for non-compliance
with &sect;393.60(c) during the test period, the driver was to present a copy of both letters to the enforcement official
involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the test was run on an instrumented segment of I&hyph;75 in Kentucky, the FHWA noted that the participating
vehicles would also operate elsewhere. Since the transponders could be damaged by repeatedly removing and re-installing
them, participants in the alpha test were allowed to leave the transponders on the windshields, no matter where the
vehicles traveled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The alpha test is anticipated to be completed on October 20, 1994. ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 has informed us that no drivers
reported any difficulties with their vision being obscured as a result of the placement of the transponder.

ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 Beta Test and HELP Program

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Both the ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 and the HELP programs are currently planning to expand the geographic coverage and scope
of their initial activities. The ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 beta test is expected to involve up to 5000 CMVs in the I&hyph;75
and Canadian Highway 401 corridor. The purpose of the beta test is to evaluate the actual operation of the transponders
and to assess their potential to be used as a part of everyday motor carrier operations on a nationwide basis. HELP will
deploy an ITS information network for CMVs in the original HELP/CRESCENT States, as well as in several additional
ones. HELP is planning to equip at least 25,000 CMVs in its fee-for-service system by the end of 1995, and at least twice
that many a year later. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Motor carriers participating in the programs have to meet stringent prequalification criteria set by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 and HELP. For ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75, these criteria include: (1) A Satisfactory safety rating
from the FHWA Office of Motor Carriers; (2) an acceptable record in all States and/or Canadian Provinces in which the
carrier intends to operate (including registration and taxes, safety performance, and other compliance items consistent
with existing statutes); (3) agreement to abide by the FMCSRs or the Canadian equivalent; (4) agreement to participate
in the project evaluation process; and (5) the carriers' self-certification that their enrolled trucks will meet
an inspection protocol, at least quarterly, equivalent to the requirements of a Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance
Level 1 inspection. The beta test is scheduled to commence in March 1995 and to continue for two years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Criteria for participation in the HELP program differ slightly. However, all States will require motor carriers
to have a Satisfactory safety rating from the FHWA Office of Motor Carriers and be in compliance with administrative
requirements (such as fuel tax and registration). Inspectors in the HELP States can require that as many as 5 percent
of all electronically cleared CMVs enter inspection stations to verify their safety and administrative status.
The officer at the inspection station can also override any bypass on a vehicle-by-vehicle basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA received formal requests for a waiver of the requirements of &sect;393.60(c) from the Commonwealth of Kentucky
on September 19, 1994, and from HELP on August 31, 1994.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Discussion of Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA believes that both motor carriers and the travelling public may derive substantial operational and safety
benefits from the use of ITS/CVO technologies. The Congress has made the ITS program the centerpiece of a concerted
effort to apply advanced technology to America's highway transportation system. The ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 and HELP
programs are the first in a series of field trials of AVI devices for commercial motor vehicles. In the relatively short
term, this technology could improve the productivity of both the trucking industry and State enforcement personnel
by reducing the need for repeated vehicle inspections. It would also reduce fuel consumption and air pollution, and
may improve highway safety by reducing congestion, particularly around inspection stations. It would also enable
POE officials to target their resources to deal with vehicles more likely to be operating in noncompliance with safety
and administrative regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While members of the ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 Policy Committee have informally expressed interest in petitioning the
FHWA to change the requirements of &sect;393.60(c), it is the agency's belief that this section should be subject
to a more detailed review than is possible in the short time remaining before the ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 beta test and
the HELP program commence. The FHWA is therefore proposing to provide a waiver from the requirements of &sect;393.60(c)
to the vehicles participating in the beta phase of the ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 project. Because the HELP program proposes
to use the same transponders as ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75, the FHWA also proposes to provide a waiver to those participating
vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA notes that no safety concerns or complaints have been reported by alpha test participants, nor by any other
parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petition for a waiver is being considered under section 206(f) of the Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1984 (49 U.S.C.
31136(e), formerly 49 U.S.C. app. 2505(f)) which authorizes waivers of any regulation issued under the authority
of that Act upon a determination that the waiver is consistent with the public interest and the safe operation of commercial
motor vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Conditions of the Waiver 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Location of the Transponder 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a condition of the waiver, the FHWA proposes that the transponder be mounted at or near the top center of the windshield,
outside the area swept by the CMV's windshield wipers, or, at a minimum, outside the driver's sight lines to the road
and highway signs or signals. The FHWA believes that this location would have no discernable effect on a driver's ability
to operate the vehicle safely. The AVI device would be placed in a position that would be within the portion of the windshield
covered by a sunvisor. It is also in approximately the same relative position in the windshield of a CMV as that of a rear-view
mirror in a passenger car. There is no evidence that sunvisors or rear-view mirrors pose a threat to safety by obstructing
a driver's vision, and thus, we have no reason to believe that a transponder of the type and dimensions to be used in the
test would have a negative effect on safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Compliance With Wiring Requirements of the FMCSRs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The installation of the transponder would be required to comply with &sect;393.27, Wiring specifications, and &sect;393.33,
Wiring [and] installation.

III. Duration of Waiver; Accident and Incident Monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the requests indicated a 2-year period for the beta test, the FHWA notes that the alpha test was delayed several
times to resolve technical matters. Since all research in a field environment is likely to experience some start-up
delays, the FHWA proposes to make the term of the waiver 3 years for HELP and 3 years for ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75, or until
the beta test is completed, whichever occurs first. This would allow for a continuous period of data collection once
the programs were fully underway. If the waiver is granted, this period would begin when the FHWA publishes the final
conditions of the waiver in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Motor carriers participating in ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 and HELP would be required to provide the FHWA's Office of Motor
Carrier Standards with information on accidents (as defined in &sect;390.5 of the FMCSRs) involving the vehicles
equipped with the transponders. Accident reports would be required to be submitted every 6 months, and would be required
to contain the information listed below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A copy of all accident reports prepared and required by State or other governmental entities or insurers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Interview information with the driver and occupants of the CMV involved. The information would be required to include
specifically whether the driver of the transponder-equipped vehicle believed that the presence of the transponder
was a factor in the accident. The interview would be required to be conducted by a motor carrier employee responsible
for supervising the driver of the transponder-equipped vehicle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. State and Local Laws 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA strongly encourages State and local authorities with safety regulations that would prohibit the use of the
proposed transponders to accept the terms of the waiver. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Number of Vehicles To Be Equipped With Transponders 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The number of straight trucks, tractors, and motorcoaches that may be equipped with the transponders would be limited
to no more than 5000 for ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 and 25,000 for HELP. The names and USDOT numbers of the motor carriers participating
in the ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 and HELP programs, as well as the number of transponder-equipped CMVs operated by each
carrier, would be required to be provided to the FHWA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. Termination of Waiver 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The transponders would be required to be removed from the CMVs participating in the ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 and HELP projects
(1) upon completion of the 3-year period, or (2) upon completion of the project, or (3) when required by the FHWA either
at the completion of a semi-annual review or at any time it is determined by the FHWA that the continued use of the devices
decreases the safe operation of the vehicles on which they are used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

VII. Report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ADVANTAGE I&hyph;75 and HELP would be required to provide separate reports at the conclusion of the program describing
the transponder's installation and use. The reports would be required to include information obtained from the drivers
on the device's effect on visibility through the windshield. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Request for Public Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA requests public comment on the proposed waiver and on the attendant conditions. Comments are also sought
from State and local enforcement officials relating to their experiences with windshield-mounted electronic devices,
such as those used in electronic toll-collection systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA is also interested in comments on the projected impacts on safety if windshield-mounted transponders were
to be allowed under &sect;393.60(c) of the FMCSRs, without the conditions that would be imposed under the waiver.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission is proposing revisions to its standard licensing application form (Form OP&hyph;1), amendments
to the regulations at 49 CFR parts 1002 and 1160, and elimination of the regulations at 49 CFR parts 1161, 1162, and 1163.
The proposed revisions implement the Trucking Industry Regulatory Reform Act (TIRRA), Title II of the Hazardous
Materials Transportation Act Amendments of 1994, Pub. L. 103&hyph;311 (August 26, 1994), which significantly amended
licensing standards for non-household goods motor property carriers, effective January 1, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To accommodate the changes mandated by TIRRA, the Commission also is proposing further modifications to the application
procedures and regulations involved in the ongoing Application Forms proceeding. The Commission's decision and
final rules adopted in this proceeding will embrace and dispose of issues pending in the Application Forms proceeding.

notice of proposed rulemaking, the Commission proposed to replace the Form OP&hyph;1 with a series of six transportation
mode-specific forms and to adopt corresponding revisions to the agency's licensing regulations. In particular,
the proposed motor carrier application forms included expanded safety fitness certification requirements for
applicants that were exempt from, or as-yet-unrated under, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) safety regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

as proposed, including the expanded safety fitness certifications. At that time, the Commission invited public
comment on further revisions to the proposed motor property carrier form to recognize revisions to DOT's hazardous
materials commodity classifications and corresponding liability insurance coverage for transporters of those
commodities.

of commodities other than household goods. Specifically, TIRRA's Sections 207 [adding a new 49 U.S.C. 10922(b)]
and 208 [adding a new 49 U.S.C. 10923(b)] respectively eliminate the public need/public interest licensing standards
for non-household goods motor property common and contract carriers and substitute fitness-based standards. Effective
January 1, 1995, the Commission is directed to issue authorities upon a finding that the applicant is in compliance
with:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Expedited Licensing Procedures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under TIRRA the application process can be shortened and dramatically simplified. The revised licensing procedures
proposed here envision processing only those applications filed by entities with acceptable DOT safety fitness
ratings or, in the case of unrated or exempt applicants, those certifying their safety compliance. In a break with
past practice, we will require each applicant to obtain the insurance certificate from the insurance company and
file it along with the application form. While we believe this approach is beneficial, we will give individuals the
opportunity to comment on whether it is feasible and whether it maintains the integrity of the insurance compliance
system. Also, at the time of filing, all applications must be accompanied by process agent filings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Up front filing of insurance information and a list of process agents will allow the Commission to compress the time
required to handle applications and confine the process to qualified applicants who are prepared to enter the trucking
industry. Safety compliance can be verified easily by Commission staff before applications are processed. As an
extra safeguard that applicants are making bona fide insurance filings, we will include the name of the insurance
carrier in the ICC Register notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the basic licensing standards confirmed prior to processing and publication of an application, the remainder
of the licensing process can be sharply reduced. By law, protests are limited to evidence that an applicant fails or
will fail to meet the fitness entry standards. The proposed revised application form and regulations, therefore,
also eliminate those features of the licensing process_such as extended protest periods and pre-licensing review
of carrier control relationships_that would unreasonably prolong or not contribute to basic fitness assessments.
The brief protest period will allow us to hear from insurance companies that question applicants' filings or others
who may have information to supplement DOT's safety information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Almost 15 years of eased entry requirements under the Motor Carrier Act of 1980 have produced a licensing docket where
each year less than a dozen of the approximately 17,000 applications filed are opposed. A brief protest period should
suffice to identify the limited number of applications that deserve strict screening. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, common control information is not necessary in applying the TIRRA licensing standards. Commonly controlled
carriers with ``Unsatisfactory'' safety fitness ratings are prioritized by DOT for continuing safety fitness oversight,
and those transporting hazardous materials or passengers, in particular, either must achieve an improved safety
fitness rating in a limited time period or be placed out of service by DOT. Those with insurance problems will be identified
through our existing insurance monitoring program. Nevertheless, we are including an ``Affiliations'' question
to be sure that carriers with poor safety compliance records do not attempt to reenter under a different name.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Also, under TIRRA, non-household goods property carriers no longer need to file tariffs for individually- determined
rates. Tariff filing is required only for collectively-determined rates. Therefore, we are eliminating the requirement
for newly-authorized common carriers to file tariffs prior to commencing operations under their certificates.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe that the expedited application procedures in the revised rules set forth below and the proposed simplified
Form OP&hyph;1 set forth in the Appendix incorporate TIRRA reforms and otherwise will preserve the integrity of the
licensing process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For applications with more extensive pre-licensing information (household goods property carriers, certain categories
of passenger carriers, brokers, freight forwarders of household goods, and water carriers), we will use mode-specific
schedules that applicants must append to their basic Form OP&hyph;1 filings. We believe that this approach will preserve
the advantages of the mode-specific format endorsed by the public in our 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Application Forms 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
proceeding without complicating the licensing process mandated under TIRRA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new procedures shift compliance screening from the end of the process to the beginning by requiring applicants
to establish their safety fitness, submit proof of insurance, and designate process agents at the time they file their
applications. Consistent with this change, we have revised the Applicant's Oath in the proposed Form OP&hyph;1 to
clarify that it embraces all supplemental filings and documentation. We also have included in the oath the applicant's
certification that it is not domiciled in Mexico nor is it owned or controlled by persons of Mexico.

Practical Reforms

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The reforms proposed here will be coupled with several practical adjustments to the agency's automated data and recordkeeping
systems. First, the Commission will simultaneously enter application information and insurance records in its
automated data system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, we will merge DOT's safety fitness data into our automated data system more frequently to confirm motor carrier
applicants' DOT safety fitness ratings. This information will continue to be checked upon initial receipt of each
application. Filings by applicants with ``Unsatisfactory'' safety fitness ratings will be rejected summarily.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, in view of the substantially reduced protest period (from 45 to 5 days), we will permit protestants to FAX their
initial submissions, followed by a signed original and one copy for Commission records. Reply and rebuttal evidence,
where permitted, likewise may be FAXed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, with TIRRA's elimination of public need/public interest standards, we will no longer publish specific
caption summaries or issue authorities with specific service descriptions to the vast majority of applicants. Applicants
will be issued certificates or permits to operate as interstate common or contract carriers. All non-household goods
motor property applicants that conform with fitness requirements will be authorized to transport general commodities
between points in the United States. The extent of each applicant's hazardous materials authority will correspond
to the level of bodily injury and property damage insurance coverage reflected in the Form BMC&hyph;91 or 91X filed
with the application, as indicated in the ICC Register licensing request notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service descriptions for licensing categories not affected by TIRRA_for example, passenger carrier special and
charter service, general commodities and household goods property brokerage, and household goods freight forwarding_also
will be standardized. This change should further simplify the pre-licensing review process and streamline application
notices and authorities.

Temporary Operating Authority
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Simplifying licensing procedures, deleting the public need/public interest standards, and expediting time frames
for issuing operating authority as proposed here largely eliminate the need for the Commission's existing temporary
and emergency temporary authority procedures. Temporary authority (TA) and emergency temporary authority (ETA)
are sought and granted routinely because of the amount of time it takes to obtain permanent authority. With the enactment
of TIRRA we will use our discretion under 49 U.S.C. 10928 to confine TAs to their original limited, intended purpose.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Accordingly, we also propose to eliminate the regulations at 49 CFR parts 1162 and 1163 governing TA and ETA applications.
However, we will continue to entertain TA requests for motor and water carrier authority in those rare instances (i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 natural disasters or national emergencies) where an applicant can document an immediate need for its service that
cannot be met by an existing carrier and for which service must be available in less than the 30 days we anticipate will
be required to process fully a permanent authority application under the procedures proposed here. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Essentially, the greatly curtailed TA process noted in the proposed regulations at 49 CFR 1160.4(g) would displace
what has been known as ETA. We expect that any such filings can be acted upon by the Commission's regional offices (

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

these issues.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
[RFA], the Commission is required to examine specifically the impact of a proposed action on small businesses and
small organizations. We expect that the proposed revised application form and corresponding regulations will result
in significant cost savings to both applicants and the Commission over the long term and will present immediate benefits
in terms of simplified administrative processes and expedited licensing procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Despite the clear prospects for cost savings and enhanced administrative efficiencies, we do not anticipate that
the proposal will have a significant economic impact as contemplated by RFA standards. The projected impact on individual
small entities, albeit positive, will be incremental and clearly not substantial within the meaning of RFA.

Paperwork Reduction Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice of proposed rulemaking will be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under
Section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 [44 U.S.C. Chapter 35]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We estimate that an average of 2.5 burden hours will be required to complete the proposed Form OP&hyph;1 and provide
pertinent supplemental evidence, as compared with 4 burden hours for the application form currently used. This expected
reduction in response time is attributable not only to elimination of the public need/public interest evidence requirements
for non-household goods motor property applicants, as mandated by TIRRA, but also to the simplified response format
and the self-contained application, supplements, and instructions. Accordingly, we anticipate that the reduced
completion burden will be realized by applicants in all motor carrier industry segments, not merely those directly
affected by TIRRA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The annual reporting burden ascribed to the Form OP&hyph;1 in the current OMB inventory is 64,000 hours, based on an
estimate of 4 burden hours per filing and 16,000 Form OP&hyph;1 filings per year at the time the estimate was submitted.
We anticipate that this annual reporting burden will be reduced to approximately 42,500 hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This estimate is based on our expectation that licensing application filings will rise slightly over those recorded
in fiscal year 1993 (to approximately 18,000). This projection reflects at least a short-term increased interest
in obtaining motor common carrier authority due to TIRRA's elimination of individual tariff filing requirements
for non-household goods motor property carriers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The estimated burden hours include time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering
and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. The reduced reporting
burden estimated here does not reflect further reductions in the Commission's overall reporting burden occasioned
by the elimination of ETA filings and the significant projected reduction in TA filings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information collection requirements contained in this proposal will be submitted to OMB for review under the
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 and 5 CFR Part 1320. Comments concerning the paperwork burden and burden-hour estimates
in this proposal may be directed to OMB and the Commission, respectively, at: Office of Management and Budget, Office
of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Attn: Ed Clark, Desk Officer, (Forms-3120&hyph;0047), Washington, DC 20503
and Interstate Commerce Commission, Forms Clearance Officer, 1201 Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20423.

applicable statutory and regulatory provisions. These applications can be opposed only on the grounds that applicant
is not fit [e.g., is not in compliance with applicable financial responsibility (insurance or surety bond) and safety
fitness requirements]. These applications are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Motor common and contract carrier of property (except household goods) and motor contract carrier of passengers
transportation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Motor carrier brokerage of general commodities (except household goods). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Certain types of motor passenger applications as described in Form OP&hyph;1, Schedule B. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Motor passenger ``public interest'' applications as described in Form OP&hyph;1, Schedule B. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Intrastate motor passenger applications under 49 U.S.C. 10922(c)(2)(A) as described in Form OP&hyph;1, Schedule
B. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Motor common carrier of household goods applications. These applications require a finding that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The applicant is fit, willing, and able to provide the involved transportation and to comply with all applicable
statutory and regulatory provisions; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The service proposed will serve a useful public purpose, responsive to a public demand or need. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Motor contract carrier of household goods, water contract carrier, household goods property broker, and household
goods freight forwarder applications. These applications require a finding that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The applicant is fit, willing, and able to provide the involved transportation and to comply with all applicable
statutory and regulatory provisions; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The transportation to be provided will be consistent with the public interest and the national transportation
policy of 49 U.S.C. 10101. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Water common carrier applications. These applications require a finding that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The applicant is fit, willing, and able to provide the involved transportation and to comply with all applicable
statutory and regulatory provisions; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The transportation to be provided is or will be required by present or future public convenience and necessity.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS issues this proposed rule to clarify that the provisions of the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) that make
it unlawful for any person or vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, intentionally to set a purse
seine net on or to encircle any marine mammal during any tuna fishing operation, apply to all U.S. citizens regardless
of the flag of the vessel. This rule also clarifies the geographic scope of the prohibition. This action is intended
to clarify statutory language to further the goals and objectives of the MMPA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In 1992, the International Dolphin Conservation Act (IDCA) amended the MMPA in several respects, including making
it unlawful, after February 28, 1994, for any person or vessel that is subject to the jurisdiction of the United States,
intentionally to set a purse seine net on or to encircle any marine mammal during any tuna fishing operation. The IDCA
provides two relevant exceptions to these prohibitions: (1) As necessary for scientific research; and (2) as authorized
by the general permit that was issued to the American Tunaboat Association on December 1, 1980.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The taking of marine mammals by U.S. purse seine vessels fishing for yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific
Ocean (ETP) is regulated by NMFS, pursuant to the MMPA, because purse seine fishing for yellowfin tuna in the ETP has
frequently involved the setting on, encircling, and capturing of dolphins as part of the fishing operation. Earlier
this year, NMFS determined that the dolphin mortality quota prescribed under the MMPA for vessels under the American
Tunaboat Association general permit (which covers only U.S.-flag vessels) had been reached and, on February 8, 1994,
closed the tuna fishery in the ETP involving the intentional setting on or encirclement of marine mammals to U.S.-flag
vessels (59 FR 8417, February 27, 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of a written inquiry and a subsequent lawsuit by U.S. citizens working aboard foreign-flag purse seine
vessels, NMFS learned earlier this year that U.S. citizens are involved in the ETP purse seine yellowfin tuna fishery
involving the intentional setting on and encirclement of marine mammals as captains and crew members on foreign-flag
vessels. For the purposes of the prohibitions that were added to the MMPA by the IDCA, NMFS considers ``any person subject
to the jurisdiction of the United States'' to include any U.S. citizen aboard a fishing vessel, regardless of the flag
of the vessel, located within the territorial sea of the United States, the U.S. exclusive economic zone (EEZ), on
the high seas, or seaward of the territorial seas of foreign nations. Therefore, U.S. citizens in other nations' EEZs,
but seaward of the territorial seas of any nation, are subject to the prohibitions of the MMPA. The highest priority
in enforcing these prohibitions will be against those U.S. citizens, such as captains or fish captains, who are in
charge of or actually control fishing operations involving the setting on and encirclement of marine mammals. A lower
priority in enforcing these prohibitions will be against crew members who are not in a position of authority involving
the conduct of fishing operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS will continue to enforce all other prohibitions governing the taking of marine mammals incidental to tuna purse
seine fishing operations, as well as all other prohibitions under the MMPA, within waters subject to the jurisdiction
of the United States, on the high seas, and seaward of the territorial seas of foreign nations. This area includes all
of the ETP seaward of foreign nations' territorial seas. The MMPA and NMFS regulations define ``taking'' to include
the harassment, hunting, capturing, or killing of any marine mammal, or the attempt to do so. Violators of the MMPA
and the implementing regulations are subject to criminal and civil penalties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule proposes to amend 50 CFR 216.24(a) to make clear that the MMPA prohibitions on intentionally setting on and
encircling marine mammals during tuna purse seine vessel fishing operations apply to all U.S. citizens regardless
of the flag of the vessel. In addition, the notice proposes to revise the language describing ``prohibited taking''
found at &sect;216.11 to make clear that the prohibition does not apply to the territorial seas of foreign nations,
but applies seaward of them.

This rule proposes to revise MMPA regulations to conform to an existing statutory prohibition that became effective
pursuant to the IDCA on March 1, 1994. The proposed rule would not establish any new prohibitions or requirements.
The Assistant General Counsel for Legislation and Regulation of the Department of Commerce has certified to the Chief
Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration that the proposed modifications to the regulations, if
adopted, would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

This rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866.

 EPA is responding to several citizens' petitions requesting the Agency to revise the list of ``extremely hazardous
substances'' published under section 302 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA).
EPA is proposing a rule to delete from the extremely hazardous substance list phosphorous pentoxide, dithlycarbamazine
citrate, fenitrothion and tellurium, and to revise the threshold planning quantity for isophorone diisocyanate
from 100 to 1,000 pounds. EPA is denying petitions requesting deletion from the EHS list of paraquat and isophorone
diisocyanate. The Agency is also denying a petition that requests revision of the threshold planning quantities
for azinphos-methyl and fenamiphos.

B. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 17, 1986, the President signed into law the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (``SARA'').
Pub. L. 99&hyph;499 (1986). Title III of SARA established a program designed to require state and local planning and
preparedness for spills or releases of hazardous substances and to provide the public and local governments with
information concerning potential chemical hazards in their communities. This program is codified as the Emergency
Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA), 42 U.S.C. 11001&hyph;11050. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subtitle A of EPCRA establishes the framework for local emergency planning. The Statute required that EPA publish
the Agency's list of ``extremely hazardous substances'' (``EHSs''). This had previously been published in November,
1985, by the EPA Administrator in Appendix A of the ``Chemical Emergency Preparedness Program Interim Guidance''
(CEPP Guidance), as the list of acutely toxic chemicals. The Agency was also directed to establish ``threshold planning
quantities'' (``TPQs'') for each extremely hazardous substance. Under section 302, a facility which has present
an EHS in excess of its threshold planning quantity must notify the State emergency response commission and local
emergency planning committee as well as participate in local emergency planning activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the extremely hazardous substance list is to focus initial efforts in the development of State and local
contingency plans. It is not intended to be a complete list of all chemicals that could potentially be hazardous to
a community. The identification of a chemical that meets the EHS criteria does not in itself indicate the potential
for serious effects in any release, accidental or routine. Thus, inclusion on the EHS list is not meant as a signal to
state or local communities to ban or otherwise restrict use of a listed chemical. Rather, such identification indicates
a need for the community to undertake a program to investigate and evaluate the potential for accidental exposure
associated with the production, storage or handling of the chemical at a particular site. EPA also encourages communities
to go beyond the EHS list when evaluating the hazards of facilities in their community, in that facilities handling
chemicals not on the EHS list could be as hazardous as those handling EHSs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The list of extremely hazardous substances and their threshold planning quantities is codified in EPA regulations
at volume 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, part 355, appendices A and B (40 CFR, Part 355, Apps. A &amp; B). EPA's
explanation for the methodologies used to determine whether to list a substance as an extremely hazardous substance
and for deriving the threshold planning quantities is found in preambles to the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notices which promulgated these rules. The relevant notices were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 17, 1986 (51 FR 41570&hyph;41592), and April 22, 1987 (52 FR 13378&hyph;13410). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the November 17, 1986 notice EPA, as required by EPCRA section 302, promulgated an interim final rule which, among
other things, included a list of extremely hazardous substances and established their threshold planning quantities.
While the interim final rule established enforceable requirements, the Agency simultaneously solicited public
comments, as explained in a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice issued on the same day (51 FR 41953&hyph;54). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA received public comment on the interim final rule and issued a final rule on April 22, 1987, which responded in its
preamble to the public comments. The April 1987 final rule made a number of revisions to the interim final rule. Among
other things, the April 1987 rule republished the extremely hazardous substance list, with the addition of four new
chemicals, and revised the methodology for determining some threshold planning quantities (52 FR 13381). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Details of the methodology used to determine whether to list a substance as an extremely hazardous substance and for
deriving the threshold planning quantities are found in the November 1986 notice at 51 FR 41573&hyph;41579 and 41580
(Attachment 1), in the April 1987 notice at 52 FR 13387&hyph;13392, and in technical support documents in the rulemaking
records.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, the Agency listed phosphorus pentoxide based upon an abstract (Ballantyne (1981)). The Agency now
believes that this abstract should not be used as the basis for listing. The title of the abstract reported the toxicity
of phosphorus pentoxide smoke. However, the study was actually performed using the smoke generated by burning red
phosphorus. In burning red phosphorus, two studies (Tarnov (1980) and Burton et. al (1982)) have shown that the major
product is phosphorus pentoxide. However, the Ballantyne abstract does not establish that the toxicity found was
attributable to the phosphorous pentoxide in the smoke, or other chemicals in lower concentrations. Since there
is no conclusive evidence to suggest that the animals in Ballantyne's study were primarily exposed to phosphorus
pentoxide, the available data from Ballantyne's findings are insufficient to prove or disprove that the LC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 values in guinea pigs and mice satisfy the criteria for listing phosphorous pentoxide on the EHS list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information submitted by the Elemental Phosphorus Ad Hoc Solid Waste Group showed that the direct tests on phosphorous
pentoxide show an LC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 value higher than the criteria for listing. In an unpublished Monsanto report (1987), rats were exposed to aerosolized
phosphorous pentoxide for 4 hours, at levels up to 0.99 mg/liter. (It should be noted that although the analytical
standards used in the analysis conducted for this study were phosphorous pentoxide, no information was obtained
regarding the actual chemical species present in the chamber atmosphere.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is the only available study in the literature that provides direct evidence of the toxic potential of phosphorous
pentoxide. The LC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for phosphorous pentoxide was found to be greater than 0.99 mg/liter, which does not meet the criteria for listing
for listing substances as an extremely hazardous substance. Since the Agency now believes that the abstract used
as the basis for listing is invalid (the Agency was unable to obtain the actual report) and the only direct studies available
to the Agency show that phosphorus pentoxide does not meet the listing criteria, the Agency is proposing to remove
the chemical from the EHS list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Diethylcarbamazine citrate was listed on the basis of a report in a Russian data compilation showing an LC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 inhalation value of 0.309 mg/liter/4 hours in rats. The citation number listed in the United Nations sponsored translation
is incorrect, and additional details about the original study are unavailable. Methods used for this inhalation
toxicity study could not be found to determine if they meet international standards, therefore, the toxicity values
could not be verified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An inhalation study sponsored by SmithKline Beecham indicated that a 1-hour exposure of rats to Diethylcarbamazine
citrate at concentration of 1.63 mg per liter or 2.38 mg per liter produced no fatalities. Since the only studies available
to EPA show that this chemical does not meet the listing criteria for inhalation (LC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 less than 0.5 mg per liter), the Agency is proposing to remove it from the EHS list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fenitrothion was initially listed because it appeared to meet the extremely hazardous substance criteria, based
upon a study showing an LC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of 0.378 mg/liter/4 hours (NIOSH/RTECS 1985). The delisting petition charged that this study was deficient in that
the material tested contained a toxic impurity of unknown potency, and that the study overestimated the toxicity
of fenitrothion itself, because the test material contained surfactants that would have made the test animal's skin
and cell membranes more permeable to the test substance. Examination of a study submitted by the petitioner (Kohda
et. al (1986)) reports an LC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of above 2.210 mg/liter. In studying the report provided by the petitioner, the Agency agrees that the data by which
the listing is based may have been in error for the reasons stated by the petitioner. Since the only other study available
to the Agency shows that fenitrothion does not meet the listing criteria, EPA is proposing to remove this substance
from the EHS list.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of less than or equal to 25 mg per kilogram (kg) of body weight. The petitioner brought to the Agency's attention that
the study was actually on sodium tellurate (CAS

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

(Prinsen (1991)) which showed an LD
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for tellurium metal in excess of 5000 mg/kg. Based upon this information, the Agency is proposing to remove tellurium
from the EHS listing while maintaining the listing for sodium tellurate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency requests comments on whether it should proceed to delist these four chemicals based upon this information
or any additional information submitted by commenters relating to whether these chemicals meet the section 302 listing
criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HULs America, Inc. submitted a petition to delist isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI). EPA is denying the petition to
delist because IPDI meets the criteria for listing, as discussed in the next Unit on Petition Denials. However, in
considering this petition, EPA noted that the threshold planning quantity had been determined based on IPDI's being
a reactive solid at standard temperatures, when in fact it is a liquid and not highly reactive. Accordingly, EPA is
proposing to change the threshold planning quantity for IPDI based on the methodology for determining threshold
planning quantities for liquids instead of the methodology for reactive solids. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's methodology for establishing threshold planning quantities for liquids, once it is determined that the substance
meets the listing criteria, consists of initially determining the maximum short term exposure concentration in
air that would not lead to serious irreversible health effects in the general population when exposed to the substance
for relatively short duration. This is the so-called ``level of concern.'' (See the Threshold Planning Quantities
Technical Support Document, April 7, 1987.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are two ways to determine a ``level of concern.'' If it is available for a chemical, EPA may use the Immediately
Dangerous to Life and Health (IDLH) level established by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
(NIOSH). This is the maximum concentration of a substance in air to which a healthy worker can be exposed for 30 minutes
and escape without suffering irreversible health effects or impairing symptoms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the IDLH value is not available, as is the case for most of the EHSs, the EPA uses an IDLH equivalent value using available
toxicity data with an adjustment factor to estimate the IDLH value. For the initial TPQ for IPDI the LC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of 0.12 mg/l over a 4 hour exposure period was multiplied by 0.1 to estimate the IDLH value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The level of concern is then divided by a factor ``V'' which represents the extent to which the material can volatilize
and become airborne and dispersed. This is explained in the November 17, 1986 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice at 51 FR 41577. For liquids this involves knowing the molecular weight and vapor pressure. The derivation of
the factor ``V'' for liquids is explained in Appendix 1 of the November 17, 1986 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice for the interim final rule (51 FR 41580). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final threshold planning quantity is then determined from a set of index values. The index values and their corresponding
threshold planning quantities are found in the threshold planning quantity technical support document. Applying
this methodology to IPDI gives it a threshold planning quantity of 1000 pounds. The calculations for this determination
are found in the administrative record for this petition. EPA is, thus, proposing to raise the threshold planning
quantity for IPDI from 100 to 1000 pounds.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is denying the petition of ICI Americas with respect to paraquat. The petitioner requests the Agency to remove
paraquat from the extremely hazardous substance list or, in the alternative, to revise the threshold planning quantity.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioner notes that the ``paraquat'' on the EHS list is actually paraquat dichloride since, strictly speaking,
paraquat is a divalent cation which can form many different salts, and paraquat dichloride is the only commercially
available paraquat salt in the United States. Further, the Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) number identified on
the EHS list is the number for paraquat dichloride. Petitioner bases its request to delist paraquat (dichloride)
on the fact that the only studies that show LD
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or LC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 tests below the Agency criteria for listing are tests on either the pure solid form of the chemical or the highly concentrated
form of the solution. Petitioner claims that the toxicity for any commercially available form is much lower than the
EHS listing criteria and that tests showing high toxicity are of no practical importance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA agrees with petitioner that paraquat dichloride is the appropriate listed chemical. To clear any confusion that
may result from the conflict between the paraquat listing and the CAS number, EPA is making a technical amendment to
the EHS listing in 40 CFR Part 355 by substituting the term paraquat dichloride for paraquat (published elsewhere
in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). All indications from the petition are that the public has been complying with the regulations under the assumption
that ``paraquat'' refers to the paraquat dichloride product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA disagrees with petitioner that paraquat dichloride should be removed from the EHS list because only highly concentrated
forms show high toxicity. Paraquat dichloride qualifies as an EHS because some form of it shows high toxicity that
exceeds the Agency's criteria. This is the case for many animal tests used to determine toxicity for regulatory purposes.
Animals may be dosed in concentrated forms or at very high levels to determine toxicity. The dose in the studies may
be much higher than any found in actual practice. In the case of LD
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or LC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 tests, half the animals die. If these tests show 50 percent mortality at a relatively low dose, they at least raise concerns
that qualify for listing. Smaller numbers of subjects may be affected at much lower doses, but that does not eliminate
any concern for the tested chemical. Paraquat dichloride is listed because it is grouped with those chemicals that
exceed Agency criteria in some form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The basis for listing paraquat was a study (Murray and Gibson, 1972) which showed a formulation containing paraquat
dichloride as having an oral (guinea pig) LD
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 value of 22 mg/kg. Although the toxicity of the paraquat dichloride formulation is caused solely by the paraquat ion,
based on the LD
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of 22mg/kg for paraquat ion, ICI estimated an oral LD
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 value of 30.4 mg/kg for paraquat dichloride which does not meet the EHS criteria. ICI sponsored two acute inhalation
studies in rats (ICI, 1989). The studies resulted in an LC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 value of .001 mg/liter for the paraquat ion, which can be estimated for paraquat dichloride to be an LC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of .00138 mg/liter. This value would meet the EHS criteria for listing of 0.5 mg/liter as noted above. EPA is changing
the basis for listing value from oral LD
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of 22 mg/kg for paraquat ion to inhalation LC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of 0.00138 mg/liter for paraquat dichloride. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioner, alternatively, requests that the threshold planning quantity for paraquat dichloride should be higher
than the current amount of 10 pounds. The threshold planning quantity for paraquat is 10 pounds for the chemical in
finely powdered form (particle size under 100 microns), in molten form, or in solution. For paraquat in solid form
with particle size greater than 100 microns the threshold planning quantity is 10,000 pounds. EPA's reasoning for
determining these levels is found in the November 17, 1986 interim final rule notice at 51 FR 41575&hyph;76 and 41577,
as amended by the April 22, 1987 final rule notice at 52 FR 13390. A summary of that reasoning follows.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The paraquat listed, essentially the dichloride salt, is a solid in solution. There is available for paraquat an IDLH
level of 1.5 milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m3). This converts to an Index Value of .0015, which results in a threshold
planning quantity of 10 pounds. While the November, 1986 notice for the interim final EHS listing rule applied this
calculation to all solids, the April 22, 1987, notice (52 FR 13390&hyph;91) modified this by applying this calculation
to solids only if they have a particle size less than 100 microns, if they are handled in solution or molten form, or if
they have a high rating for reactivity. For particle sizes over 100 microns, the threshold planning quantity is 10,000
pounds. Paraquat dichloride, therefore, has two threshold planning quantities depending on its particle size and
whether it is used in solution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner requests that the Agency base the level of concern for paraquat dichloride on the LD
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or LC

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 tests rather than the IDLH. EPA disagrees. The IDLH, while it has flaws, is the best available measure for determining
a level of concern because it is based on actual human data. When an IDLH is available, EPA declines to use conversion
factors, as it does for those substances for which IDLH values are not available (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 51 FR 41576), because these factors are even rougher measurements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NIOSH lists the two chemicals (paraquat and paraquat dichloride) as synonyms (NIOSH/RTECS 1983 Synonyms, Volume
1, p. 719); therefore, the Agency considers the ionic form of paraquat as the dichloride salt in a solution. Since the
IDLH value applies to both the salt and the solution, EPA has decided not to remove the chemical from the EHS list or modify
the TPQ. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The paraquat ion is reportable as a solution (or mixture) of paraquat dichloride and a carrier (for example, water).
For threshold purposes, the facility only needs to consider the weight percent of paraquat dichloride that was placed
in the solution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Miles, Inc., has submitted a petition requesting that the 10,000-pound TPQ apply to azinphos-methyl and fenamiphos
in the Miles products Guthion 2L and Nemacur 3. Both of these chemicals have TPQs of 10 pounds that apply when the chemicals
are in finely powdered form, in molten form, or in solution, as calculated using the same methodology applied to paraquat
dichloride. The 10,000-pound TPQ applies to the solid form with particle size greater than 100 microns. The petitioner
submits that both of these compounds are ``waxy, amorphous solids with low melting points and their technical grade
materials used for production are generally liquid at summer temperatures.'' The petitioner stated that the TPQ
for the chemicals should be based upon their being liquids using the methodology described for IPDI, above, in unit
II. This would raise the TPQ to 10,000 pounds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA disagrees. The Farm Chemicals Handbook (1984 p. C161) lists fenamiphos as a brown, waxy solid. The Hawley handbook
(1981) lists azinphos-methyl as a brown waxy solid as well. Since these references, used as background to the listing,
show these chemicals as solids, the EPA considers the chemicals as solids as well. They would be near the melting point
but never quite reach it. Molten solids are not treated as liquids under the TPQ methodology, because the solids have
to be raised above standard temperature in order to become molten. Since EPA has no way of knowing at what temperatures
facilities have the molten solids (to determine volatilization), EPA chose to consider solids different from chemicals
that are liquid at standard temperatures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Instead, EPA accounts for solids that become liquids (molten form) with the two tiered threshold. When handled in
molten form, the TPQ for these chemicals would be 10 pounds because of the possibility of volatilization. However,
even in molten form, significant amounts of vapor are not likely to be generated. The Agency examined the fraction
of volatilization expected for the solids on the list and found that it ranges from 0.3 to 0.008 pounds/minute per pound
spilled (see Threshold Planning Quantities, Technical Support Document, April 7, 1987, page 27). Since data were
not available for all solids and to be conservative, the Agency chose to incorporate the 0.3 fraction into the reporting
requirements. If a facility is handling the solid in molten form, the amount molten should be multiplied by 0.3 to obtain
the actual amount to be compared to the threshold planning quantity for reporting (see 40 CFR 355.30(e)(iv)).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HULs America Inc. submitted a petition to delist isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI). IPDI had been listed because it
met the criteria for extremely hazardous substance listing, on the basis of two aerosol inhalation-toxicity studies
in rats. The 4 hour LC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is .26 mg per liter, which is less than the LC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of 0.5 mg/liter which qualifies it as an extremely hazardous substance under Agency criteria (51 FR 41574). The delisting
petition made the following points. This material is manufactured in a closed system that does not use high pressure,
and contends that unusual measures are required to generate test atmospheres containing IPDI for toxicity testing.
If the substance is aerosolized, particles would be expected to precipitate out of the air. The material is not volatile
under normal conditions. It does not react rapidly with water to generate heat that might cause volatilization. The
low vapor pressure led the Department of Transportation to remove IPDI from its list of materials that are toxic by
inhalation, according to the petition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA disagrees. Petitioner's argument is essentially that the test used to determine acute toxicity subjects the
animals to extreme conditions not likely to be found in reality. This, however, is the case for many animal tests used
to determine toxicity for regulatory purposes. In fact, a similar case can be made for most LD
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or LC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 tests, since the levels at which animals are dosed are far higher than would be delivered in actual conditions. The
fact is that IPDI is toxic at low levels, based on an LC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, compared to other chemicals regardless of the conditions of the chemical during the test. This qualifies the chemical
for listing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Extrapolations from the extreme conditions of testing may then be used to determine regulatory levels. For example,
to determine a level of concern for chemicals on the EHS list in calculating threshold planning quantities, as noted
above, EPA applies a conversion factor to the acute toxicity tests. Conversion factors may range from one-tenth to
one-hundredth of the levels found in the acute toxicity tests. This is explained in the November 17, 1986 Interim Final
Rule preamble at 51 FR 41576. For listing purposes, however, conditions of testing are not generally relevant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA, however, as noted above, has taken into account physical/chemical properties of IPDI in proposing to revise
the TPQ. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that the data used to list paraquat, azinphos-methyl, fenamiphos and isophorone diisocyanate is sound
and that the denial of these petitions is consistent with the listing criteria and TPQ methodology. At this time, the
Agency is not planning to modify the listing criteria nor the TPQ methodology. The Agency however, will accept any
comments on additional criteria which can be used to increase the usefulness of the EHS list and the TPQ methodology.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the consideration of these petitions, HULs America brought to the Agency's attention that there may be at least
three competing products with toxicity and physical/chemical properties very similar to IPDI and, therefore should
be treated the same. Huls maintains none of the chemicals should be listed. EPA is requesting information on other
chemicals, currently not listed, for which toxicity meets the criteria, and which therefore warrant listing. At
this time, EPA is not proposing to increase the number of chemicals on the EHS list; however, in the future it will propose
to list chemicals with toxicity information showing that they warrant listing.

IV. Regulatory Analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866, [58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)] the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines
``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal
governments or communities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or lean programs or the rights and obligations
or recipients thereof; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the terms of Executive Order
12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., whenever an agency is required to publish a notice
of rulemaking for any proposed or final rule, it must prepare and make available for public comment a regulatory flexibility
analysis that describes the effect of the rule on small entities (i.e., small businesses, small organizations, and
small governmental jurisdictions). This analysis is unnecessary, however, if the agency's administrator certifies
that the rule will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has examined the rule's potential effects on small entities as required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act. It
has determined this rule will have no adverse effect on small entities because it reduces the number of chemicals which
would potentially make businesses subject to the reporting requirements. Therefore, I certify that today's proposed
rule will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Paperwork Reduction Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule relieves facilities from having to report the presence of these four chemicals to the State Emergency Response
Commissions and Local Emergency Planning Committees. If these facilities have no other Extremely Hazardous Substances,
they will no longer be required to participate in the emergency planning process required by the statute. Therefore,
there are no information collection requirements for OMB to review under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.
