SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes to revise an earlier 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed airworthiness directive (AD), which would have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
superseded AD 91&hyph;08&hyph;01. That AD currently requires the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following on Jetstream Aircraft Limited (JAL) Jetstream 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Model 3101 airplanes: revising the maximum speed for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flaps at 50 degrees from 153/149 knots indicated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airspeed (KIAS) to 130 KIAS; and limiting the maximum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flap extension to 20 degrees anytime ice is present on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the airplane. The previous notice proposed to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the option of incorporating a flap system modification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that would eliminate the requirements of AD 91&hyph;08&hyph;01. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since publication of that proposal, the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation Administration (FAA) has re-examined all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information related to this subject, and has determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the flap system modification should be made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandatory rather than optional. The proposed actions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are intended to prevent sudden pitch down of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplane during icing conditions, which could lead to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loss of control of the airplane.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an AD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that would apply to certain JAL Jetstream Model 3101 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8, 1992 (57 FR 30174). That action proposed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supersede AD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
91&hyph;08&hyph;01 with a new AD that would (1) retain the flap 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system operating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revision and limitation currently required by AD 91&hyph;08&hyph;01; and (2) limit the applicability to only those

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplanes that do not have the flap system modified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with British Aerospace (BAe) Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bulletin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
27&hyph;JA 910541. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons have been afforded an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity to participate in the making of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendment. One comment was received in agreement with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed AD and no comments were received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerning the FAA's determination of the cost upon the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since issuing that action, the FAA has re-examined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all available information on this issue, and has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that the limitation of maximum flap setting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 20 degrees in icing conditions presents an unsafe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition in certain circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Jetstream Model 3101 airplane has a feature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
known as ``lift dump'', which allows for proper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deceleration by automatically extending flaps from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
50 degree position to the 70 degree position when the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nose wheel strut is compressed during landing. When 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
landing with a flap setting of 20 degrees, ``lift dump'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not normally available, which can make deceleration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more dependent upon propeller reverse or manual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Propeller reverse is utilized in normal operation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as an aid in reducing landing roll distance. The other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
option is manually selecting flaps from 20 degrees to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
50 degrees immediately after touchdown while the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplane is traveling at a higher speed. When the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator selects the 50-degree position with all ground 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logic constraints satisfied, the flaps will extend to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 70-degree position. This technique can result in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
high aerodynamic loads upon the flap, which could cause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
structural damage that, if not detected and corrected, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could result in loss of airplane directional control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
caused by failure of the flap system. Also, there is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temporary increase in wing lift when manually extending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the wings from 20 degrees to 35 degrees, which could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result in the airplane becoming airborne or a reduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of directional control and braking force. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because ``lift dump'' is available with the flaps 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the 35-degree position during landing, the FAA has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that (1) the flap system modification that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allows the use of flaps at 35-degrees with ice visible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be incorporated; and (2) AD action should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taken to prevent sudden pitch down of the airplane 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during icing conditions, which could lead to loss of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control of the airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since incorporating the 35 degrees flap 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modification into the notice of proposed rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifies additional procedures that go beyond the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scope of what was originally proposed, the notice has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been revised accordingly and the comment period has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been reopened to provide additional time for public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment. The proposed AD would supersede AD 91&hyph;08&hyph;01 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with a new AD that would (1) retain the flap system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operating revision and limitation currently required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
until the 35-degree flap system modification was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporated; and (2) eventually require incorporating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 35-degree flap system modification in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the instructions in Jetstream Aircraft Limited SB 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA estimates that 141 airplanes in the U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would take approximately 23 workhours per airplane to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplish the proposed modification, and that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer will provide parts at no cost to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owner/operator. Based on these figures, the total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimated to be $194,580. This figure is based on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumption that no affected owner/operator has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporated the proposed modification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Jetstream Aircraft Limited has informed the FAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that 122 modification kits have been delivered to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected airplane owners/operators. Since each of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these airplane operators have incorporated revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flight manual supplements, the FAA assumes that each of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these kits is installed on one of the affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplanes. With this in mind, the proposed cost impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upon U.S. operators would be reduced $168,300 from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$194,580 to $26,220. In addition, Jetstream Aircraft 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Limited informed the FAA that the other 19 affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplanes are in the storage inventory of their sister 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
company JSX. The policy of JSX is to incorporate this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modification before distributing one of the affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplanes to an operator. Taking these factors into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration, the proposed AD would provide no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic cost impact upon U.S. operators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial direct effects on the States, on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relationship between the national government and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, or on the distribution of power and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibilities among the various levels of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
government. Therefore, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promulgated, will not have a significant economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes to supersede AD 81&hyph;09&hyph;03 R1, which currently requires repetitively inspecting
the rudder pedal adjusting mounting bracket for cracks on Jetstream Aircraft Limited (JAL) HP137 Mk1 and Jetstream
series 200 airplanes, and replacing any cracked bracket. The Federal Aviation Administration's policy on aging
commuter-class aircraft is to eliminate, or in certain instances, reduce the number of repetitions of certain short-interval
inspections when improved parts or modifications are available. The proposed action would require replacing the
mounting bracket with a new mounting bracket of improved design as terminating action for the repetitive inspections
that are currently required by AD 81&hyph;09&hyph;03 R1. The actions specified in the proposed AD are intended to
prevent inadvertent rudder movement caused by a cracked rudder pedal adjusting mounting bracket, which could result
in loss of rudder control.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has determined that reliance on critical repetitive inspections on aging commuter-class airplanes carries
an unnecessary safety risk when a design change exists that could eliminate, or in certain instances, reduce the number
of repetitions of those critical inspections. In determining what inspections are critical, the FAA considers (1)
the safety consequences of the airplane if the known problem is not detected by the inspection; (2) the reliability
of the inspection such as the probability of not detecting the known problem; (3) whether the inspection area is difficult
to access; and (4) the possibility of damage to an adjacent structure as a result of the problem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These factors have led the FAA to establish an aging commuter-class aircraft policy that requires incorporating
a known design change when it could replace a critical repetitive inspection. With this policy in mind, the FAA recently
conducted a review of existing AD's that apply to JAL HP137 Mk1 and Jetstream series 200 airplanes. Assisting the FAA
in this review were (1) the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom;
(2) JAL; (3) the Regional Airlines Association (RAA); and (4) several U.S. and foreign operators of the affected airplanes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From this review, the FAA has identified AD 81&hyph;09&hyph;03 R1, Amendment 39&hyph;4150, as one that should be
superseded with a new AD that would require a modification that could eliminate the need for short-interval and critical
repetitive inspections. AD 81&hyph;09&hyph;03 R1 currently requires repetitively inspecting the rudder pedal
adjusting mounting bracket for cracks on Jetstream Aircraft Limited HP137 Mk1 and Jetstream series 200 airplanes,
and replacing any cracked bracket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
JAL has developed Modification No. 5162, which introduces a new rudder pedal adjusting mounting bracket with increased
sectional dimension, part number (P/N) 1379111E 1. Included with this modification are Instructions to Modification
No. 5162, Part 1 and Part 2, Issue 1, dated June 1981.

Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States under the provisions of section 21.29 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on its aging commuter-class aircraft policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and after reviewing all available information including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that received from the CAA, the FAA has determined that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AD action should be taken to (1) eliminate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repetitive short-interval inspections required by AD 81&hyph;09&hyph;03 R1, Amendment 39&hyph;4150; and (2)
continue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preventing inadvertent rudder movement caused by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cracked rudder pedal adjusting mounting bracket, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could result in loss of rudder control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is likely to exist or develop in other JAL HP137 Mk1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Jetstream series 200 airplanes of the same type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
81&hyph;09&hyph;03 R1 with a new AD that would (1) retain the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspections of the rudder pedal adjusting mounting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bracket for cracks and require replacing any cracked 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part as required by the current AD; and (2) require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replacing this mounting bracket with an improved part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of increased sectional dimension, P/N 1379111E 1, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminating action for the repetitive inspections. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed inspection would be accomplished in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with Jetstream Service Bulletin No. 9/10, dated April 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
28, 1981. The proposed replacement would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplished in accordance with the Instructions to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Modification No. 5162, Part 1 and Part 2, Issue 1, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dated June 1981. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 11 airplanes in the U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would take approximately 160 workhours per airplane to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplish the proposed modification, and that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. Parts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost approximately $1,800 per airplane. Based on these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S. operators is estimated to be $116,600. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All 11 of the affected airplanes are HP137 Mk1's; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there are no Jetstream series 200 airplanes registered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the United States, but they are type certificated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for operation in the United States. According to FAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records, none of these HP137 Mk1 airplanes are in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation or anywhere near operating condition. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this reason, JAL no longer stocks Modification No. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5162, but can develop modification kits within three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
months after order. Since there are no airplanes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently in operation, the cost impact of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AD would be narrowed to only those owners/operators 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returning their airplane to operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial direct effects on the States, on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relationship between the national government and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, or on the distribution of power and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibilities among the various levels of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promulgated, will not have a significant economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes to adopt a new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airworthiness directive that would apply to Jetstream 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aircraft Limited (JAL) HP137 Mk1, Jetstream series 200, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Jetstream Models 3101 and 3201 airplanes. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed action would require repetitively inspecting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the passenger/crew cabin door handle mounting platform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
structure for cracks, and, if found cracked, replacing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with a structure of improved design as terminating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action for the repetitive inspections. Cracks found on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this structure on two of the affected airplanes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prompted the proposed action. The proposed actions are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended to prevent the inability to open the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
passenger/crew door because of a cracked internal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handle mounting platform structure, which could result 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in passenger injury if emergency evacuation was needed.

Discussion

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exist on JAL HP137 Mk1, Jetstream series 200, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Jetstream Models 3101 and 3201 airplanes. The CAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports two incidents of passenger/crew cabin door 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handle mounting platform structure cracking.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This condition, if not detected and corrected, could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result in the inability to open the passenger/crew door 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and possible passenger injury if emergency evacuation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Jetstream Aircraft Limited has issued Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bulletin 52&hyph;A&hyph;JA 930901, Revision 1, dated February 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11, 1994, which specifies procedures for inspecting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and replacing the passenger/crew internal door handle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mounting platform structure on JAL HP137 Mk1, Jetstream 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
series 200, and Jetstream Models 3101 and 3201 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplanes. The CAA classified this service bulletin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as mandatory in order to assure the continued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airworthiness of these airplanes in the United Kingdom. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CAA classifying a service bulletin as mandatory in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the United Kingdom is equivalent to the FAA issuing an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airworthiness directive in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in the United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all available information, and determined that AD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action is necessary for products of this type design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are certificated for operation in the United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is likely to exist or develop in other JAL HP137 Mk1, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Jetstream series 200, and Jetstream Models 3101 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3201 airplanes of the same type design, the proposed AD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would require repetitively inspecting the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
passenger/crew cabin door handle mounting platform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
structure for cracks, and, if found cracked, replacing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with a structure of improved design as terminating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action for the repetitive inspections. The proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions would be accomplished in accordance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service information described above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 165 airplanes in the U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would take approximately 1 workhour per airplane to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplish the proposed modification, and that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$8,800. This figure does not take into account any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible passenger/crew door internal handle mounting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
platform structure replacements nor repetitive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspections. The FAA has no way of determining how 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
many of these structures may have cracks or the number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of repetitive inspections each owner/operator may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial direct effects on the States, on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relationship between the national government and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, or on the distribution of power and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibilities among the various levels of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promulgated, will not have a significant economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Flexibility Act. A copy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action has been placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department seeks comment on a proposal to expand its rules on Super Bowl tours to cover air tours to other types of
special events. These Super Bowl rules require that operators of Super Bowl tours that are promoted as including game
tickets must have those game tickets in hand or under contract before they advertise or sell the tours, and that they
must refund the entire tour price to any customer who does not receive a promised game ticket. This proposed rule would
also extend the charter rule's prohibition on last-minute price increases to non-charter tours to special events.
This initiative arises as a result of problems on certain tours to the 1994 Rose Bowl on which participants did not receive
game tickets that were promoted as being included in the package, or were required to make additional payments in order
to receive tickets.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In conjunction with the Rose Bowl football game that was played in Pasadena, California on January 1, 1994, a large
number of fans of the University of Wisconsin (one of the two teams participating in the game) purchased package tours
to California. Many of those tours were promoted as including a ticket to the Rose Bowl game. However, a significant
number of these individuals either did not receive the game tickets that they had been promised and did not gain admission
to the game, or were required to make an additional payment after they arrived in Pasadena in order to obtain their tickets.
The Department is seeking comment on a proposal to extend its rules on Super Bowl tours to include air tours to other
types of special events where admission to the event is advertised as being included in the package. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department's rules on Super Bowl charters are contained in title 14, part 380 of the Code of Federal Regulations
(14 CFR part 380):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 380.2 defines a Super Bowl charter as a charter flight that is represented by its charter operator as
including tickets to the National Football League's Super Bowl game as part of its ground package.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 380.18a states that a Super Bowl charter may not be advertised unless the operator has submitted verification
to the Department
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 that the operator (1) is in physical possession of enough Super Bowl game tickets to provide them for a substantial
number of seats on the charter, or (2) has a contract with the NFL or with an NFL team for such a number of game tickets,
or (3) has a contract with another person who has a contract with the NFL or an NFL team for such a number of game tickets.

References to ``the Board'' in Part 380 refers to the Civil Aeronautics Board, the Department's predecessor in aviation
economic and consumer matters. The Department of Transportation now administers this rule as authorized by the Civil
Aeronautics Board Sunset Act of 1984 (P.L. 98&hyph;443; 98 Stat. 1703).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Section 380.18a also states that a Super Bowl charter may not be sold unless the operator has submitted verification
to the Department that the operator has possession of, or contracts for, enough game tickets to provide one to every
person who is to receive one under the terms of the operator/participant contract for the charter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 380.31(c) states that if an operator receives a booking for which he or she does not have possession
of or a contract for a game ticket, the operator must return that participant's money within 3 days, unless the participant
has authorized the operator in writing to retain the payment while the operator seeks additional tickets.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Sections 380.32(s), 380.33(a)(5) and 380.33(e) state that if Super Bowl game tickets are not supplied when
promised, the affected participant must be sent a refund of the price of the entire charter package within 14 days after
the return flight.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These rules came about following problems with game tickets for Super Bowl tours in the late 1970's (see 45 FR 1856,
January 9, 1980). The rules were limited to the Super Bowl because that was the only event where such problems had surfaced.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the Super Bowl rules in Part 380, the Department has a policy statement at 14 CFR 399.87 which states that
it shall be an unfair or deceptive practice within the meaning of section 411 of the Federal Aviation Act (now 49 U.S.C.
41712) to advertise or sell an air tour that is promoted as including a ticket to the Super Bowl game unless the operator
has tickets or contracts for tickets in the manner described in 14 CFR 380.18a (see above). The principal purpose of
this policy statement is to reach tours operated on scheduled air service, which are not covered by the part 380 charter
rules. The part 399 policy statement mirrors &sect;380.18a, but does not include the other part 380 provisions described
above. Most importantly, it does not include the requirement that the entire tour price be refunded if a game ticket
is not provided.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On January 27, 1994, the Department issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in this proceeding (published
February 1, 1994; 59 FR 4614). In this notice, we stated that we were tentatively proposing to issue a new rule that would
contain the procedures of the Super Bowl provisions of both part 380and part 399, and to extend this rule to other types
of events. Like current &sect;399.87, the new rule would apply to tours on all forms of air transportation, not just
charters. Like the existing Super Bowl charter rules in part 380, the new regulation would require the tour operator
to refund the entire tour price to any participant who does not receive a promised event ticket, even if the tour were
not on a charter. The proposed rule would also pick up the procedures of &sect;380.31(c) of the charter rule, which
requires an operator to refund any money received for a booking within 3 days if the operator has no contract for an event
ticket for that person, unless the person has authorized the operator in writing to retain the payment while the operator
seeks a ticket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to setting out the Department's tentative rulemaking proposal, the January ANPRM asked commenters to
address a number of questions about the types of issues that such a rule should apply to. The discussion of the comments
that appears below is organized according to those questions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department received comments from 11 organizations and 7 individuals. The great majority of the comments favored
adoption of a rule in this area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Q. Should the rule apply only to major sports events which would be listed in the rule (for example, the Super Bowl, college
bowl games, the NCAA Final Four, the World Cup finals, the Olympics)? To any sports event? To religious events (for
instance, the Passion Play in Oberammergau)? To any event? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several of the comments discussed only sports events as the context for the rule. The National Collegiate Athletic
Association (NCAA) recommended applying the rule to the Division I Final Four men's and women's basketball championships,
the College World Series, and post-season college football bowl games. The Football Bowl Association (FBA), an organization
representing all 19 post-season college football bowl games, also felt that all post-season football bowl games
should be covered, and stated that it offered no comment on whether other events should or should not be covered. The
National Hockey League (NHL) commented that the rule should apply to all major professional and amateur sports events.
Ms. Sara Shea said that the Super Bowl rule should be expanded to include other special sporting events.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Wisconsin Attorney General stated that the rule should not be limited to specifically named events, but perhaps
could be limited to ``competitive events'' where participants and locations are determined close to the date of the
event. He said that for non-competitive events such as the Passion Play in Oberammergau, the dates, locations and
participants are known well in advance and existing consumer protections should be adequate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters stated that the rule should not be limited to sports events. The American Society of Travel Agents
(ASTA) said that it should apply to all events where a separately-purchased ticket is necessary for admission to the
event. The RG Travel Companies, which were involved in sending 1,700 Wisconsin fans to the 1994 Rose Bowl, stated that
the rule should cover any special event ``where a good possibility exists that the demand for tickets will exceed the
supply&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*'' In a similar vein, the Pasadena Tournament of Roses commented that the rule should
apply to any event with limited admission. The National Tour Association (NTA, representing motor coach tour operators)
and Congressman Robert Andrews of New Jersey expressed the opinion that the rule should not be limited to sports events.
Ms. Arlene Caldwell said that the rule should cover any tour that claims to include a ticket to the event, and Mr. Donald
Hamilton stated that it should apply to any event for which tour packages are sold.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. Should the rule apply to both charter and scheduled transportation?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All of the commenters that expressed an opinion on this point felt that the rule should apply to both scheduled and charter
air transportation. Those commenters were the RG Travel Companies, NACA, the NHL, ASTA, the NCAA, FBA, the Pasadena
Tournament of Roses, and the Wisconsin Attorney General.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. Should the rule contain only the advertising and sale restrictions of &sect;&sect;380.18a and 399.87 (of the current
Super Bowl rule), or should it also contain the ``money back guarantee'' of &sect;&sect;380.32 and 380.33 and/or
the ``booking rejection'' and ``contingent booking'' procedures of &sect;380.31(c)?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 380.18a and 399.87 prohibit advertising or sale of a ``Super Bowl tour'' (defined as one which is held out
as including a ticket to the Super Bowl game) until the operator has physical possession of game tickets or has a contract
with the National Football League, with an NFL team, or with another person who has a contract with the league or a team.
Sections 380.32 and 380.33 state that any participant on a Super Bowl tour who does not receive promised game tickets
must be given a refund of the entire tour price, even if a portion of the services are used. Section 380.31(c) provides
that if an operator receives a booking for which he or she does not have possession of or a contract for a game ticket,
the operator must return that participant's money within 3 days, unless the participant has authorized the operator
in writing to retain the payment while the operator seeks additional tickets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Except for NTA, all commenters that expressed a position on this question felt that some form of regulation along these
lines was appropriate. NTA stated that the majority of its members that responded to a poll on this matter felt that
regulation of special-event tours should not be a responsibility of the government, but the association said that
in the event a rule is adopted it favors the ``booking rejection'' and''contingent booking'' procedures of &sect;380.31(c).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ASTA and the Wisconsin Attorney General also expressed support for the ``booking rejection'' and ``contingent booking''
procedures. They favored the ``money back guarantee'' as well, as did the RG Travel Companies, the National Air Carrier
Association (NACA, an organization of charter airlines), the NHL, NCAA, FBA, and Pasadena Tournament of Roses. The
Tournament of Roses stated that this guarantee should apply ``at any time prior to departure'' if it is clear tickets
will not be forthcoming. FBA commented ``the greater the remedy available, the less likely that tour packagers will
create the problem by promoting packages that may not be legitimate.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NACA said that there should be an exception to the ``money back guarantee'' for situations of force majeure and acts
of God, such as the earthquake in San Francisco that forced postponement of the World Series. Similarly, the NHL stated
that if the event is canceled or substantially altered after the tour begins, consumers should be entitled only to
a refund of the face value of the event ticket, but that if such cancellation or alteration takes place before departure,
the operator should be required to inform the consumers, who would have the right to cancel (presumably with a full
refund).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congressman Andrews was also in favor of the ``money back guarantee,'' as well as a requirement for tour operators
to disclose whether event tickets are guaranteed or tentative. However, he stated that any rule that would totally
prohibit marketing of a special-event tour until the tour operator has event tickets in hand would not be practical.
Tickets for many such events are not available until less than two weeks before the event, he pointed out, but other
arrangements (e.g., air and hotel) must be made before that. NTA, the NCAA and the Wisconsin Attorney General stated
that the current restrictions against marketing Super Bowl tours until the operator has game tickets in hand or under
contract should be included in the new rule.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Q. If the scope of the type of event covered by the rule is broad, and the rule contains the ``money back guarantee,''
should procedures be included that would protect the operator from having to refund the entire tour price if a participant
doesn't receive promised admission to something like a welcoming cocktail party?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No commenters spoke in favor of a requirement to apply the ``money back guarantee'' to events such as a welcoming cocktail
party. Of those who commented on the issue, NTA, the NHL, ASTA, the Pasadena Tournament of Roses said that operators
should not be required to refund the entire tour price over failure to provide something like a promised welcoming
cocktail party. NACA and the Wisconsin Attorney General stated that the rule should require the value of undelivered
ancillary events to be refunded, but should not require a refund of the entire tour price. FBA and the Wisconsin Attorney
General both pointed out that certain events on a special event tour (e.g., the Tournament of Roses parade on a Rose
Bowl tour) are integral to the experience for which the tour was organized while other events on the same tour (e.g.,
a side trip to Disneyland) are not. These two commenters suggest that integral events be protected by the'' money back
guarantee'' of the total tour price, but not other events.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. Should the rule specifically ban last-minute or post-departure price increases for admission to the event, one
of the problems that allegedly occurred on the 1994 Rose Bowl tours?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All commenters who offered an opinion on this subject felt that last-minute price increases should be regulated in
some manner. The RG Travel Companies, NACA, the NCAA, ASTA, the Wisconsin Attorney General and Mr. Donald Hamilton
stated that last-minute price increases should be banned. FBA and the Pasadena Tournament of Roses said that price
increases at any time following purchase should be prohibited unless the consumer receives written notice that the
operator reserves this right. The Pasadena Tournament of Roses also suggested that participants who cancel within
a few days of notification of a price increase be entitled to a full refund. The Wisconsin Attorney General commented
that on tours to special events, ``last-minute or post-departure price increases are common and are tantamount to
extortion'' because other options may be sold out.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NHL stated that, in general, price increases should be banned unless the face value of the ticket has been increased
subsequent to departure of the tour. However, for events with short lead times such as the Stanley Cup playoffs, the
NHL said that the rule should permit tours on which participants are required to agree to purchase event tickets at
the yet-unknown face price plus a service fee, as long as the consumer is given prominent notice of this fact.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. Some tours are promoted in conjunction with a special event, but do not include, and do not represent that they include,
admission to the event. For example, there have been tours to the Super Bowl host city during the Super Bowl weekend
that prominently feature ``Super Bowl'' in the headline of advertisements and flyers, but which do not include game
tickets. Should the new rule ban this practice, or require affirmative, prominent disclosure that admission to the
event is not included?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All of the commenters that expressed an opinion on this issue felt that it should be regulated in some manner. The RG
Travel Companies stated that they favored either banning the practice or requiring disclosure. The NCAA urged affirmative,
prominent disclosure, ``if such tours are to be allowed at all.'' All others who commented on this point (the NHL, ASTA,
FBA, the Pasadena Tournament of Roses, and the Wisconsin Attorney General) recommended prominent disclosure. The
NHL suggested a requirement that text disclosing the absence of event tickets from event-oriented tours should be
at least 75 percent of the size of the name of the event in advertising material. The Pasadena Tournament of Roses said
that such disclosures should be at least twice the size of the smallest text elsewhere in the ad or flyer, but in no case
less than 12-point type, and that disclosure during verbal contacts should also be required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Q. What would be the economic burdens of such a rule? Would the rule be impractical for events where the participants
are known only a week in advance, e.g. the NCAA Final Four?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All of the parties that commented on this issue agreed that the rule can and should apply to events in which the participants
are not known until shortly before the event. The RG Travel Companies commented that the rule would not be impractical
because commitments centering around a particular team could be made contingent on that team qualifying for the event.
NACA said the ``money back guarantee'' should apply regardless of the timing of the event. The NHL stated that the rule
may be burdensome for organizers of short-lead-time tours, but that this is justified by the benefit to consumers.
(Note also the NHL's earlier suggestion that on events where the participants become known only shortly beforehand,
the rule should permit tours in which the participants must agree to purchase an event ticket whose face value is not
yet known.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ASTA, like NACA, said that the degree of advance notice is not relevant, and that an operator who markets an event-oriented
tour before the participants are known should simply disclose that event tickets are not included in the advertised
price. FBA commented that participating teams in college bowl games are generally known at least a month in advance,
and also that any experience the Department has had with Super Bowl tours would be instructive, as the competing teams
in that game are sometimes determined only a week before the game.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Pasadena Tournament of Roses, the NCAA and the Wisconsin Attorney General all pointed out that even though the
participating teams in the NCAA Final Four (the example in this question) are determined only the weekend before,
the tickets are sold out months beforehand. Thus, the fact that the participants are not known until the final week
has minimal impact on the availability of tickets and the feasibility of tours. The Pasadena Tournament of Roses asserted
that any economic burden resulting from this rule would fall on ticket brokers and tour operators who buy event tickets
from individuals in order to resell them. The Wisconsin Attorney General stated that consumer protection may be even
more important in cases where event participants are determined at the last minute, because consumers have less time
to investigate their options.

The Air Transport Association (ATA, an association of large scheduled airlines) filed a comment stating that it expressed
no opinion about whether, or to what extent, the current Super Bowl rules should be made applicable to tours to other
special events. However, ATA said that DOT should not make air carriers responsible for assuring that tour operators
comply with the new rule. NACA echoed this view, stating that carriers should not be made the guarantors of tour operators.

We have decided to propose a rule very similar to that described in the ANPRM, which in turn closely tracks the existing
rules for Super Bowl tours.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The rule that we are proposing would apply to any tour that is organized for the purpose of attending a sporting, social,
religious, educational, cultural, political or other event of a special nature and limited duration, which exists
for reasons apart from the tour itself, and which is represented by the operator of the tour as including admission
to that event. The Department does not wish to engage in line-drawing ofthe type that would be required were we to publish
a list of specific events that would be covered by the rule. In addition, we see no justification for limiting the applicability
of the rule to sporting events. Few commenters specifically suggested such a limitation, although a number of them
offered sports contests as examples of the type of event that should be covered. While the Wisconsin Attorney General
is of course correct when he comments that the date and location of a non-competitive event such as the Passion Play
in Oberammergau is known well in advance, this in itself does not lessen the likelihood of ticket shortages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We agree with the comments that suggested that the rule should apply to any event where a separate ticket is required
for admission to the event or where there is limited admission. The rule that we are proposing will apply to any tour
to an event of the type described at the beginning of the previous paragraph in which the tour operator has represented
that the tour includes admission to the event. If the event is free, or attendance is unlimited, the operator should
have no trouble furnishing tickets and this rule will impose no burden. On the other hand, if tours are promoted to an
unusually popular event of a non-sporting nature, those tour participants would be just as disappointed at not receiving
the promised admission to the event that constituted the entire purpose of their trip as would a fan traveling to a bowl
game.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have tentatively concluded that the rule should apply to both charter and scheduled air transportation, as well
as to any other form of air service meeting the statutory definition of ``air transportation'' that may develop in
the future. Thus, we are proposing to apply it to ``scheduled, charter, and other air transportation.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would apply to all interstate (i.e., domestic)
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 air transportation, and to foreign (i.e., international) air transportation originating at a point within the United
States. Applying the rule only to outbound international flights is consistent with the approach taken in the existing
Public Charter rule (see 14 CFR 380.23) and with the'' country of origin'' concept of regulation of international
air transportation. As a policy matter, the Department has no interest in applying this rule to tours originating
in foreign countries whose participants are largely or exclusively foreign citizens.

The statutory term ``overseas air transportation,'' which referred to domestic transportation to or from U.S. territories
or possessions, was abolished in a recent recodification of transportation laws. Such transportation is now included
in the definition of ``interstate air transportation,'' and consequently would be covered by this proposed rule.

The rule that we are proposing would apply to any operator of a tour that meets the definition of a Special Event Tour,
regardless of whether that operator is a direct air carrier (i.e., an airline), an indirect air carrier (e.g., a Public
Charter operator), or a ticket agent (e.g., a scheduled-service tour operator, including a travel agent acting as
a tour operator). The proposed rule would apply to both U.S. and foreign entities that act as operators of Special Event
Tours, just as current &sect;399.87 does.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

With regard to the comments of ATA and NACA, the ANPRM did not propose, and wedo not propose here, that this rule should
include provisions that obligate direct air carriers to assure that tour operators comply with the rule. Except where
an airline might choose to directly operate a Special Event Tour (i.e., to become the tour operator), a direct air carrier
of a Special Event Tour will incur no greater or lesser obligations under this rule than it has in its capacity as a common
carrier either certificated under 49 U.S.C. 41101 or holding a foreign air carrier permit issued under 49 U.S.C. 41301
(formerly sections 401 and 402 ofthe Federal Aviation Act).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As we suggested in the ANPRM, we are proposing to carry over the provisions from the existing Super Bowl rule that prohibit
advertising or sale of such tours before game tickets are in hand or under contract. In the rule we are proposing here,
these provisions will be expanded to apply to all special events. This approach was supported by the comments, and
involves no novel processes since the existing procedures have been in place in the Super Bowl rule for 15 years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the provision that prohibits advertising or sale of a Super Bowl tour until game tickets are in hand or
under contract, the Super Bowl charter rule requires Super Bowl charter operators to include in the prospect us that
is required to be filed with the Department for all Public Charters a certification that they have the game tickets
in hand or else a copy of the contract for the game tickets. We do not propose to carry over this additional filing requirement
to the new rule. The underlying requirement to have the tickets or ticket contracts before advertising or sales commence
will remain and is enforceable. The Super Bowl rules that apply to scheduled-service tours have never required a filing
of this type. Now that regulation of this type of tour is being consolidated in a single rule, we see no justification
for having a filing requirement for charter tours but not scheduled-service tours, nor do we see a need to impose a new
paperwork burden on scheduled-service tour operators. This action is consistent with the Paperwork Reduction Act
and with the Department's proposal in Docket 48341 (57 FR 42864) to eliminate unnecessary paperwork burdens on charters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congressman Andrews expressed concern that any rule that would prohibit marketing of a tour until tickets are in hand
would not be practical, since tickets for many events are not available until a couple of weeks in advance but other
arrangements (e.g., air and hotel) must be made before that. However, neither the existing nor proposed rules requires
that tickets be in hand before marketing is allowed; the operator must simply have a written contract for the tickets.

The proposed rule also incorporates the so-called ``booking rejection'' and ``contingent booking'' procedures
currently found in &sect;380.31(c) of the Super Bowl charter rule, and expands them to apply to all events and to all
forms of air transportation. These provisions require operators to return unsolicited bookings for which they don't
have event tickets unless a tour participant authorizes the operator in writing to retain the participant's payment
while the operator attempts to obtain more event tickets. We are modifying this slightly to allow for situations in
which participants agree to take the tour without an event ticket; the operator would be required to obtain the participant's
written acknowledgment of this understanding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the key provisions of the Super Bowl charter rule is the requirement for the operator to refund the total tour
price to any participant who does not receive a promised game ticket, even if the participant uses all of the other tour
features. The ANPRM tentatively proposed to incorporate this provision in the new rule, but also asked for comment
on whether the rule should contain only the ``booking rejection'' and ``contingent booking'' procedures without
the ``money back guarantee.'' However, the comments solidly supported the ``money back guarantee,'' and we have
incorporated it in the proposed rule. We agree with the Football Bowl Association that strong consumer remedies will
also have the effect of deterring the promotion of non-legitimate tour packages.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NACA commented that there should be an exception to the ``money back guarantee'' for situations of force majeure and
acts of God, such as the earthquake in San Francisco that caused postponement of the World Series. The NHL suggested
that if the event is canceled or substantially altered, participants should be entitled only to a refund of the face
value of the event, not the total tour price. It was never our intent to make the tour operator the guarantor of the event
itself. The ``money back guarantee'' in the existing Super Bowl charter rule kicks in ``if game tickets are not supplied.''
The rule we are proposing here would require refunds ``.&blank;.&blank;. if promised admission to the [event] is
not furnished by the tour operator .&blank;.&blank;.'' These provisions are directed toward potential problems
with ticket distribution, not with the event itself. If people who have
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 tickets are able to attend the event and Special Event Tour participants are shut out because they don't have tickets,
the ``money back guarantee'' applies. On the other hand, if nobody with a ticket can use it during the period of the tour
because the event itself was canceled or postponed, the ``money back guarantee'' does not apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We wish to make it clear that we are talking only about problems with the event itself, not about any or all problems that
the tour operator might view as beyond its control. Failure of a ticket broker to deliver tickets to the tour operator
does not invalidate the ``money back guarantee.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We agree with the NHL that if the event is canceled consumers should receive a refund for the portion of their tour price
that applied to the event that they paid for but did not receive. However, mandating such a partial refund in a situation
where the event itself did not take place and where there were no problems with ticket distribution is beyond the scope
of this proceeding. This is a matter best dealt with in the context of contract law or other applicable existing law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ANPRM solicited comment on whether the rule should include procedures to protect the tour operator from having
to refund the total tour price to participants who don't receive promised admission to an ``event'' like a welcoming
cocktail party. Most commenters who addressed this issue were opposed to requiring a refund of the entire tour price
in these circumstances. Some suggested that participants so affected simply be entitled to a refund of the value of
that ancillary event. Two commenters urged that a tour operator's failure to deliver admission to ancillary events
that are integral to the experience for which the tour was organized (e.g., the Tournament of Roses parade on a Rose
Bowl tour) should entitle the participant to a refund of the total tour price.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In raising this issue in the ANPRM, the Department had intended to focus on the situation of a tour that would not normally
be thought of as a Special Event Tour but which held out admission to an ``event'' as one of its features, e.g., a welcoming
cocktail party on a 5-day package to the Bahamas. If the definition of ``special event'' had been broad, we were concerned
that the rule might have the effect of requiring refunds of the entire price on such tours after failure to deliver a
relatively minor and low-value component. The comments have shed light on another issue: multiple ``events'' on
a true Special Event Tour. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We agree with the commenters that failure to deliver a relatively minor feature should not result in a refund of the
total tour price. We also feel that this rule should be limited to tours that are organized around an event, not to events
that occur in the normal course of the typical vacation tour. Accordingly, we have limited the scope of the proposed
rule in two ways. First, there will be a definition of ``Special Event Tour'' in proposed &sect;381.5 which is broad
yet specific; it will limit the applicability of the rule to tours to sporting, social, religious, educational, cultural,
political or other event of a special nature and limited duration, which exist for reasons apart from the tour itself.
Second, the ``money back guarantee'' in proposed &sect;381.11 will apply only to the primary event for which a Special
Event Tour is organized.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Limiting the ``money back guarantee'' to the primary event on the tour will solve the problem of having this guarantee
cover minor events on a true Special Event Tour. However, it will also have the effect of excluding some more significant
events such as the Tournament of Roses parade. Nonetheless, we have tentatively decided to move in this direction.
Identifying the primary event on a Special Event Tour will seldom be a matter of debate. However, identifying secondary
events that are ``integral to the experience'' of the tour would be a far more subjective exercise, and in any event
is beyond the scope of this proceeding as set forth in the ANPRM. Tour participants who do not receive promised admission
to a secondary event may have a contractual right to a refund of the value of that event, and they can pursue that with
the tour operator.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the ANPRM, the Department solicited comment on whether the rule should ban last-minute or post-departure price
increases, something which occurred on certain tours to the 1994 Rose Bowl. The great majority of the comments on this
subject favored banning such increases. Some commenters said no price increase should be permitted unless the tour
operator has reserved this right in writing and allows participants to cancel and receive a full refund in the event
of a price increase.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have decided to incorporate into the proposed rule the price increase provisions of the Department's Public Charter
rule (14 CFR &sect;380.33). While it is not our intent in this proceeding to address all potential sources of consumer
harm on Special Event Tours, the issue of price increases is directly related to the issue of ticket availability.
Almost any event ticket is procurable if the price is right; if we did not regulate price increases in the Special Event
Tour rule, tour operators would always be able to acquire event tickets at greatly inflated prices and then simply
increase the price to the participant to cover it. Since a ticket has been offered in this situation, the ``money back
guarantee'' would not come into play.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed provisions on price increases, modeled on similar provisions in the charter rule, state that if a given
participant is assessed price increases for the tour that in the aggregate are more than 10 percent above his or her
original tour price, the participant shall have the right to cancel and receive a full refund (i.e., no cancellation
penalties would apply). No price increases in any amount would be permitted less than 5 days before departure (as opposed
to 10 days in the charter rule, recognizing the fact that Special Event Tours often have shorter lead times than the
typical charter). This would eliminate both last-minute and post-departure price hikes. Finally, proposed &sect;381.11
specifies that the promised event ticket must be furnished at the price agreed to before departure or else the operator
is subject to the ``money back guarantee'' just as if he had not provided the ticket at all.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NHL commented that for events with short lead times such as the Stanley Cup playoffs, the rule should permit tours
on which participants are required to agree to purchase event tickets at the yet-unknown face price plus a service
fee, as long as the consumer is given prominent notice of this fact. As an initial matter, we would point out that a tour
would not be covered under this rule at all if the event ticket were simply held out as an option rather than as a mandatory
feature. However, where the participant must agree to buy the event ticket, such tours are clearly Special Event Tours
since the tour operator is representing that admission to the event is included in the tour (even if the price of that
admission is not yet known and consequently any price that is advertised for that tour is not the full tour price). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, nothing in the proposed rule would explicitly prohibit a transaction of this type. The operator would still
have to have the requisite number of event tickets under contract before advertising or sales could begin; in other
words, the variable must be price, not availability. Beyond that, the proposed rule requires that tour participants
must receive promised event tickets ``at the tour price agreed to before departure'' or else the participant is entitled
to a refund of the total tour price. If a participant agrees to a price consisting of a known value 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
p
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 plus an unknown value 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and the operator delivers the tour (including the event ticket) at that price, the operator has satisfied the requirements
of the rule.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ANPRM noted that some tours are promoted in conjunction with a special event, but do not include, and do not represent
that they include, admission to the event. We solicited comment on whether the new rule should ban this practice, or
whether it should specify a form of required disclosure. Most of the comments favored requiring disclosure of the
fact that an event ticket is not included. However, we have tentatively decided not to include such a requirement in
the proposed rule. Consumers solicited for these tours are able to determine from the advertising material that an
event ticket is not held out as included; this is distinguishable from the situation of a tour participant who paid
for an event ticket and then did not receive it. Should any particular tour deceptively imply that event tickets are
included when in reality they are not, the Department has authority to take enforcement action against deceptive
practices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ANPRM sought comment on whether the rule would be impractical for events where the participants are known only
a week in advance, such as the NCAA Final Four. All of the parties that commented on this issue thought that this should
not be a problem, and that the rule should apply. As noted in the Comments section above, several commenters pointed
out that the Final Four sells out months in advance even though the participating teams are not determined until the
week before. Also, as FBA noted, the contestants in the Super Bowl have been determined only the week before on several
occasions, and that does not appear to have either harmed the marketability of Super Bowl tours or resulted in additional
consumer problems.

While the period for comment on a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is normally 60 days, the Department is requesting comment

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The rule proposed in this notice has changed little from the tentative proposal that the Department discussed in
detail in the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in this proceeding (59 FR 4614, February 1, 1994). The Comments
on the ANPRM were largely supportive of the proposal, and we do not anticipate controversy over this NPRM. The proposed
rules are drawn from existing regulations on charters and Super Bowl tours, and the industry is familiar with the procedures
in those rules. If the volume or nature of the NPRM comments should warrant, the Department can extend the comment period.

This NPRM is considered to be a non-significant rulemaking under DOT regulatory policies and procedures, 44 FR 11034.
The proposal would have minimal economic impact, and accordingly no regulatory evaluation has been prepared. The
NPRM was not subject to review by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs pursuant to Executive Order 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPRM has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and
it has been determined that it does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism
Assessment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Upon acceptance of the money for a sale, the operator must reserve one event ticket for that individual. An operator

(b) An operator of a Special Event Tour may accept a booking and payment from an individual for whom the operator does

no event ticket has been reserved for him or her. This agreement shall specify whether the person has agreed to participate
in the tour without an event ticket and/or the operator has agreed to attempt to acquire an event ticket for this person.
If the two parties agree that the operator will attempt to acquire an event ticket, the agreement shall specify any
penalties that will apply if the individual later cancels because an event ticket did not become available. If the
operator notifies this person that an event ticket has become available, that person shall enjoy all the other protections
of this rule from that time.

I. Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Chemical Diversion and Trafficking Act of 1988, (PL 100&hyph;690) (CDTA) was passed by Congress to control the
diversion of certain chemicals (hereinafter referred to as listed chemicals) that are necessary for the illicit
manufacture of drugs such as heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and LSD. The CDTA and its implementing regulations,
as set forth in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR), parts 1310 and 1313, established a system of recordkeeping
and reporting requirements through which DEA and the chemical industry could identify persons seeking to divert
listed chemicals for the manufacture of illicit drugs. The CDTA allows for the tracking and, where necessary, control
of domestic and international transactions involving listed chemicals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CDTA has had strong success. The greatest impact has been in the international arena, with a significant reduction
in exports of listed chemicals from the United States to countries that are known sources of cocaine. Domestically,
the volume of chemicals available to clandestine laboratories was reduced. However, these successes also highlighted
several shortcomings in the CDTA, including:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The CDTA provided a mechanisms for DEA, with the cooperation of the chemical industry, to identify persons engaging
in suspicious transactions and, as needed, take action against those persons. However, lacking evidence that an
individual knowingly supplied chemicals for the illicit manufacture of drugs, DEA's options were limited.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Persons engaged in the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine and methcathinone were able to obtain supplies
of the listed chemicals critical to the manufacture of such drugs through the purchase of drug products that were exempted
from the provisions of the CDTA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Illicit drug manufacturers in foreign countries began to purchase their supplies of listed chemicals from countries
other than the United States, on occasion utilizing the services of United States based brokers and traders to facilitate
the transactions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To address these and other concerns, Congress passed legislation in late 1993 to amend the CDTA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=2 -->
II. The Domestic Chemical Diversion Control Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;200)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Domestic Chemical Diversion Control Act of 1993 (DCDCA) was signed into law on December 17, 1993, and became effective
on April 16, 1994. The DCDCA is intended to close avenues used by illicit drug manufacturers to circumvent the CDTA.
The main provisions of the DCDCA are as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Precursor and essential chemicals have been redesignated as List I and List II chemicals respectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Any person who manufactures, distributes, imports or exports a List I chemical must obtain a registration from
DEA. DEA is authorized to deny an application for registration or suspend or revoke a registration to manufacture,
distribute, import or export a List I chemical, if it is established that such registration would not be in the public
interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Transactions involving drug products marketed under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) which contain ephedrine,
either as the sole active medicinal ingredient or in combination with therapeutically insignificant quantities
of another active medicinal ingredient, are now included in the definition of regulated transaction. Subjecting
these products to the registration, recordkeeping and reporting requirements eliminates a virtually unrestricted
source of ephedrine for illicit manufacturers of methamphetamine and methcathinone. The DCDCA also grants DEA the
authority to remove the exemption for any other drug that contains a listed chemical if DEA determines that the drug
is being diverted in order to obtain the listed chemical for use in the illicit manufacture of a controlled substance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Brokers and traders based in the United States who arrange international transactions involving listed chemicals
will be subject to the same reporting and recordkeeping requirements as exporters of listed chemicals, thus controlling
a previously unmonitored source of chemicals for clandestine laboratories in foreign countries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Manufacturers of listed chemicals are required to provide DEA with annual reports regarding the manufacture of
such chemicals. The reports will provide DEA with information regarding the volume of listed chemicals available
in the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
III. Implementation of the DCDCA
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
To implement the DCDCA, DEA is proposing the following regulatory changes and additions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A new part 1309 of Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations is to be added, setting forth the specific requirements for
registration, the application forms to be used, the application fees, exemptions from the registration requirement,
security provisions, and administrative procedures regarding approval or denial of an application, revocation
of registration, and administrative hearings. With respect to the requirement of registration in the proposed Section
1309.21, DEA has granted a temporary exemption from the registration requirement pending implementation of the
registration program, as set forth in an Interim Rule published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 24, 1994 (59 FR 13881).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the CDTA, regulated persons consist of those firms engaged in the distribution, importation or exportation
of chemicals. The DCDCA regulates drug products containing ephedrine which are distributed by retail distributors
such as convenience stores, liquor stores, truck stops, gas stations, nutrition centers, etc. These retail outlets
do not distribute any other listed chemicals and their activities consist solely of the sale of such products directly
to walk-in customers. DEA has determined that retail distributors should be categorized separately in light of the
limited scope and volume of their chemical activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 822(d), the Administrator may waive the requirement of registration. The Administrator is
proposing in &sect;1309.25 of these regulations to exempt persons registered with DEA to manufacture, distribute,
dispense, import, or export a controlled substance from the chemical registration requirement for equivalent activities
involving drug products that are regulated as List I chemicals pursuant to &sect;1310.01(f)(1)(iv). This includes
such traditional sources for these products as pharmacies, hospitals, pharmaceutical manufacturers, distributors,
etc. Further, the Administrator proposes in &sect;1309.27 to exempt from the registration requirement those persons
who manufacture a List I chemical solely for internal use, with no subsequent distribution or exportation.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to the exemptions from the registration requirement, DEA has determined that persons who manufacture
List I chemicals solely for internal use, without any subsequent distribution or exportation of such chemicals,
should not be required to obtain a registration, since there is a low risk of diversion from such persons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has also been determined that persons who are registered with DEA to manufacture, distribute, or dispense controlled
substances shall not be required to obtain a separate registration to distribute drug products that are regulated
as List I chemicals. Further, persons who are registered with DEA to import or export controlled substances shall
not be required to obtain a separate registration to engage in the same activities with drug products which are regulated
as List I chemicals. Persons registered to engage in activities with controlled substances are subjected to more
comprehensive investigations by Federal and state authorities relating to their controlled substance registrations
than is required for a chemical registration. The Administrator reserves the right in this proposal to cancel a person's
exemption from the registration requirement, if continuation of the exemption would not be in the public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Section 1310.01 is amended to revise the definitions of ``regulated transaction'' and ``regulated person'',
and to add new definitions of ``broker'' and ``trader'', and ``international transaction''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Chemical mixtures that met the definition of ``chemical mixture'' set forth in &sect;1310.01(g) prior to the effective
date of the DCDCA shall remain exempted from the definition of regulated transaction until DEA has promulgated final
regulations regarding the procedures by which manufacturers may request exemption of chemical mixtures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Section 1310.02 is amended to remove three chemicals from List I: d-lysergic acid, n-ethylephedrine and n-ethylpseudoephedrine;
and to add to List I: nitroethane and benzaldehyde, as established by the DCDCA. In addition, the DEA chemical codes
assigned to the listed chemicals have been added.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Section 1310.03 is amended to implement the requirement that manufacturers of listed chemicals report certain
data to DEA. This requirement will only apply to bulk manufacturers of listed chemicals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Section 1310.04 is amended to reflect the additions and deletions of the List I chemicals and to set forth the proposed
thresholds for the new chemicals. With respect to the newly added chemicals Nitroethane and Benzaldehyde, records
and reports must be kept only for those transactions, including cumulative transactions within a calendar month,
which equal or exceed the proposed thresholds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Sections 1310.05 and 1310.06 are amended to include a reporting requirement with respect to drug products containing
ephedrine that are regulated as List I chemicals and to set forth the required format for the chemical manufacturer
reports. Drug products containing ephedrine are legitimately distributed solely for human consumption. Thus,
the distribution of 375 dosage units (approximately a two-month supply at the current recommended therapeutic dose)
or more of such drug products in a calendar month to a person who is not registered with DEA to distribute or export a List
I chemical would be considered extraordinary and therefore would have to be reported.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Section 1310.08 is amended to add international transactions to the types of transactions regulated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Sections 1310.10 through 1310.15 are added to set forth the procedures regarding removal of the exemption from
recordkeeping and reporting requirements of drugs distributed under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the exemption
from recordkeeping and reporting requirements of chemical mixtures, and the identification of drugs which contain
ephedrine in combination with therapeutically significant quantities of another medicinal ingredient.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Section 1313.02 is amended to revise the definitions for ``regulated person'' and ``regulated transaction'';
and definitions for ``regular importer'', ``established record as an importer'', ``broker'' and ``trader'', and
``international transaction''; and to remove the definition of ``regular supplier''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Sections 1313.12, 1313.15 and 1313.21 are amended to set forth criteria regarding the waiver of the 15 day notification
requirement for certain imports and exports of listed chemicals and the removal of the waiver of the 15 day notification
requirement for exports of listed chemicals to specified countries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Sections 1313.32, 1313.33 and 1313.34 are added to establish the notification requirements for brokers and traders
engaging in international transactions.

IV. Fees
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1309.11 proposes the application fee for registration and reregistration of manufacturers, distributors,
importers and exporters of List I chemicals, as authorized by section 3(a) of the DCDCA. The proposed fee was established
pursuant to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A&hyph;25, as revised on July 15, 1993 (58 FR 38142),
which sets forth Federal policy regarding user fees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Circular A&hyph;25, Section 6 provides that ``[A] user charge *&blank;*&blank;* will be assessed against each
identifiable recipient for special benefits derived from Federal activities beyond those received by the general
public.'' The section further requires that the user charge be sufficient to ``*&blank;*&blank;* recover the full
cost to the Federal Government for providing the special benefit.'' A special benefit is described as a Government
service which ``Enables the beneficiary to obtain more immediate or substantial gains or values (which may or may
not be measurable in monetary terms) than those that accrue to the general public (e.g., receiving a patent, insurance,
or guarantee provision, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
or a license to carry on a specific activity or business
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 [emphasis added] or various kinds of public land use)''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 822 and 957 of Title 21, United States Code, as amended by the DCDCA, require that any person who manufactures,
distributes, imports or exports a List I chemical must obtain annually a registration in accordance with DEA rules
and regulations. A registration to manufacture, distribute, import or export List I chemicals is a benefit under
Circular A&hyph;25, in that it allows the registrant to engage in certain activities while a member of the general
public may not. Therefore, the costs associated with DEA's issuance of a registration to manufacture, distribute,
import or export a List I chemical; certain costs associated with advising registrants of their responsibilities;
and maintenance of the integrity of the registration system must be recovered through assessment of a user fee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Section 6(d) of Circular A&hyph;25 describes the requirements for determining the full cost of a service or benefit.
``Full cost'' is defined as all direct and indirect costs, including, but not limited to: direct and indirect personnel
costs, including salaries, fringe benefits (such as life and health insurance and retirement) and travel; physical
overhead, including material and supply costs such as forms, postage, equipment, rent and utilities; management
and supervisory costs; and the costs of enforcement, collection, research, establishment of standards, and regulation.
Section 6(d)(1)(e) provides that the cost figures shall be established utilizing ``the best available records of
the agency and new cost accounting systems need not be established solely for this purpose.'' The cost of the services
provided by DEA were determined by use of proven and accepted budget estimating techniques as outlined in the DOJ budget
guidelines and OMB Circular A&hyph;11.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Considerations for the Establishment of the Original Fee
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DEA has identified two distinct categories of chemical registrants: retail distributors, such as convenience stores,
gas stations, truck stops, liquor stores, etc., whose regulated activities consist of the direct sale to walk-in
customers of drug products that are regulated as List I chemicals; and non-retailers, such as manufacturers which
distribute, distributors, importers and exporters of List I chemicals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon contacts with the chemical industry and surveys of the industry over the past three years, DEA estimates
that approximately 1,500 applications for registration will be received from non-retailers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the information gathered from various sources, including association data, surveys of ephedrine manufacturers
and distributors, and correspondence received from ephedrine distributors, DEA estimates that there may have been
as many as 100,000 retail distributors that, prior to the April 16, 1994 effective date of the DCDCA, sold drug products
that are now subject to regulation. However, estimating the number of persons who will continue to engage in activities
with the regulated drug products is speculative, due to a variety of factors. Some retailers who engaged in this previously
unregulated activity may decide to no longer sell items for which registration is required by law. Also, the activities
of retail distributors may be affected by state laws, such as those in Wisconsin, Florida and Missouri, which require
that drug products containing ephedrine as the sole medicinal ingredient may only be dispensed pursuant to prescription.
Another consideration is the availability of alternative products that are not subject to the registration, recordkeeping
and reporting requirements. DEA has learned that certain distributors of single-entity ephedrine products have
already advised their retail customers to switch to such alternative products to avoid the registration and recordkeeping
requirements. Therefore, for purposes of establishing the initial fee, DEA estimates that 10,000 applications
will be submitted by retail distributors. The number of applications is important only when considering apportionment
of indirect costs associated with initial registration. For the first year of the registration program, this amount
will constitute $22.00 of the total fee. Thus, a larger or smaller number of applicants would not result in any significant
increase or decrease in the registration fee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the implementation of the DCDCA, DEA will focus on processing applications, conducting pre-registration
and follow-up investigations and the creation and dissemination of information regarding the registrant's responsibilities
under the DCDCA. DEA expects that the majority of its chemical control resources will be required to handle the applications
which will be submitted immediately following implementation of the regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once the pre-registration process for existing businesses has been handled, the primary focus of DEA's chemical
control program will be investigations of violative firms and registration denial or revocation proceedings. Such
enforcement activities protect the integrity of the registration system by ensuring that registrants continue
to meet the requirements of the DCDCA. DEA's activities will include, but not be limited to, extensive investigation
and collection of documentation regarding violative practices by registrants; attorney review and preparation
by DEA's Office of Chief Counsel; staff and attorney time to prepare for proceedings to deny or revoke a registration;
Administrative Law Judge and staff to conduct registration denial hearings; and DEA budget and controller staff
time for budget planning, accounting and auditing of fees collected. The benefits of these activities accrue to the
over-all registrant population and the costs for such activities must be averaged across the entire registrant population.
However, as described earlier, the expected registrant population and the extent of these enforcement activities
are speculative at this time. Therefore, the costs associated with these activities have not been included in this
initial fee, since they are indirect costs that would have to be averaged across a presently unknown population of
applicants.

After the registration process is completed and the registrant population and extent of activities necessary to
protect the integrity of the system has been determined, DEA will revise its fee schedule to recover the full costs
of its chemical control program, as required by Circular A&hyph;25. DEA will publish in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 its revised fee schedule and invite comment by interested parties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the above, the initial registration fee will be based upon the cost of processing the individual application,
the associated investigation of the qualifications and suitability for registration, and the creation and dissemination
of information regarding the responsibilities under the DCDCA. Reregistration fees under this proposal will include
enforcement and compliance costs associated with maintenance of the integrity of the registration and control system.
These fees will not include enforcement costs of reviews of records and reports of fully complaint registrants exclusively
to identify leads to possible illicit drug laboratories.

The Initial Registration Investigation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The fundamental purpose of the pre-registration investigation is to determine the fitness and suitability of the
applicant to engage in the activities for which registration is requested and to ensure that the applicant is familiar
with its responsibilities to prevent the diversion of regulated products or chemicals. This will be accomplished
through an on-site visit to the applicant (following receipt and processing of the application for registration
by clerical personnel) by DEA Diversion Investigators. During this on-site visit, the applicant's responsibilities
with respect to security, record-keeping and reporting will be discussed; the applicant's existing provisions
for security, record-keeping and reporting, if any, will be reviewed, along with previous sales and customers; and
the applicant will be provided with material, such as the Chemical Handlers Manual, regarding chemical trafficking
and controls. In addition, the investigator will perform background checks on the applicant, owner and employees,
and prepare the necessary reports summarizing the results of the registration review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Retail distributors engage in a limited activity as regulated by the DCDCA. By contrast, non-retail chemical firms
may deal in a range of List I chemicals, in bulk lots or, pursuant to orders received by mail, telephone, facsimile or
other electronic means. Consequently, the average pre-registration investigation for a retail distributor will
entail less DEA investigative time than for a non-retail chemical firm.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Method for Collection of Fees
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the initial registration fee, DEA has established separate costs for processing the application, and for conducting
the pre-registrant investigation. Both costs will be incurred by the applicant prior to their initial registration
under the DCDCA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, DEA anticipates receiving 1500 applications from non-retail chemical firms and approximately 10,000
applications from retail distributors. DEA will place priority on the completion of the pre-registration investigations
of non-retail chemical firms. All non-retail applications will be processed and reviewed within the first year of
the effective date of this regulation. Therefore, the full fee (application and pre-registration investigation
costs) must be submitted with the application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the demands for resources to conduct registration reviews of non-retail applications and for other chemical
control activities, DEA will be unable to process and review all of the applications submitted by retail distributors
within the first year following the effective date of the final rule. As a consequence, retail distributors will be
subject to a split fee schedule for their initial registration. Each retail distributor will include with their application
the established fee to cover the costs of processing the application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on available resources, DEA will identify and notify approximately 1500&hyph;2000 of the retail applicants
that they are scheduled for pre-registration review in the first year. Each applicant so identified will be required
to pay the additional established cost for the registration investigation prior to commencement of the review. Based
upon the volume of applications received, DEA may conduct additional retail registration investigations in the
first year. In the second year, DEA will redirect resources spent conducting non-retail pre-registration investigations
to the retail level. DEA anticipates an additional 6,000 to 8,000 pre-registrant investigations to be conducted
in the second year. These retail distributors will similarly be notified of the investigation fee to be paid. They
will 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 be required to submit another application fee. However, if a retail distributor fails to submit the required investigation
fee within 30 days after notification by DEA, that retail distributor's application will be withdrawn.

Following the completion of the initial registration process, DEA will dedicate ongoing resources to insuring the
controls of the DCDCA are being maintained, protecting the integrity of the system, and providing assistance, guidance,
and interpretation of the chemical control requirements to the registrants. These costs, along with application
processing costs will establish the basis for the annual reregistration fee. Since many of these costs will be averaged
across the registrant population, it is only possible to establish a reregistration fee at this time based upon estimated
populations. After the full second year of the regulations implementing the DCDCA, the fee schedule will be reviewed,
as required by Circular A&hyph;25, and a new fee structure proposed for public comment, based upon the actual registrant
population.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated above, DEA will complete the registration process for all non-retail applicants in the first year. Investigative
resources devoted to these pre-registration investigations (approximately 12 workyears) will be directed towards
completion of the pre-registration process of retail distributor applicants in the second year. At the non-retail
level, DEA will dedicate eight workyears of investigator time to conduct follow-up investigations of approximately
75 non-retail firms. Each investigation will require a comprehensive review of each registrant's records, reporting
systems and security provisions to ensure that the registrant is complying with the chemical control requirements,
and chemicals are not being distributed to persons seeking to divert them. Investigators will conduct a comprehensive
on-site review of the registrant's records; verification of transactions and purchasers, including record checks
of and visits to purchasers; travel; and report preparation. This cost, plus the reregistration processing fee and
the above listed indirect costs averaged over the estimated 1500 non-retail registrants will constitute the non-retail
reregistration fee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the retail level, due to the large volume of firms and the general lack of experience in the required record-keeping
and reporting requirements, DEA will conduct a greater number of follow-up investigations. However, in light of
the anticipated smaller volumes of regulated transactions of such firms, each follow-up is scheduled for a smaller
amount of on-site time. DEA anticipates that two Diversion Investigator workyears will be required to conduct follow-up
investigations at the retail level. This cost, plus the reregistration processing fee and above listed indirect
costs averaged over the estimated 2000 retail distributors registered in the first year will constitute the reregistration
fee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As DEA completes the second year of the chemical registration program, the bulk of the retail distributor new applications
will have been processed, thus freeing the resources assigned to conduct the registration investigations. In the
following years, there will be a greater number of registrants submitting applications for reregistration. DEA
will dedicate proportionally greater resources to these registrants. As noted earlier, following the initial two
years of the registration program, DEA will conduct a review of the fee structure and, as needed, publish a notice in
the

The costs associated with the registration process are as follows. DEA estimates that 1,500 non-retail applications
and approximately 10,000 retail applications will be received. As previously stated, the personnel costs listed
below include all direct and indirect costs, including salaries, fringe benefits (such as life and health insurance
and retirement) and travel; physical overhead, including material and supply costs such as forms, postage, equipment,
rent and utilities:

 notices, issuance of policy statements and directives related to the registration program and responding to registrant
queries regarding registration matters. This time is for general chemical registration program purposes and must
be spread equally across the applicant population. The cost of that time, $22,202, divided by 11,500 applicants equals
$1.93.

wishing to divert them. The investigations will consist of a comprehensive review of each registrant's records,
reporting systems and security provisions. Each investigation will require comprehensive on-site review of the
registrant's records; verification of transactions and purchasers, including record checks of and visits to purchasers;
travel; and report preparation. Based on current estimates, DEA anticipates that all such follow-up investigations
combined will require 8 workyears of Diversion Investigator time. The total cost for 8 workyears of Diversion Investigator
time is $666,464, divided by 1,500 non-retail reregistration applicants equals $444.31.

V. Regulatory Flexibility and Small Business Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
DEA has examined the impact of the DCDCA and this proposed rule in the light of Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory
Flexibility Act (PL 96&hyph;354). DEA has identified approximately 1,500 firms or persons, other than retail distributors,
who handle List I chemicals. These non-retail chemical firms are generally known to DEA because most have been subject
to the recordkeeping and reporting requirements of the CDTA for a number of years. Independent retail distributors,
however, are primarily small business entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DEA has found that in addition to the traditional sources of distribution (i.e., hospitals, pharmacies, pharmaceutical
manufacturers and distributors, etc.), independently owned and operated retail outlets such as convenience stores,
liquor stores, truck stops, gas stations, and nutrition centers engage in sales to the public of the single entity
drug products that are not regulated. Based on information received from various distributors, the potential affected
population of retail outlets that handled the single entity drug products prior to the April 1994 effective date of
the DCDCA, could be as high as 100,000. How many of these will choose to continue their sales of the single entity drug
products and be subject to the registration, recordkeeping and reporting requirements is unclear, due to such factors
as: (1) The introduction of state laws making drug products containing ephedrine prescription drugs, (2) the availability
of alternative products which are not subject to the chemical regulations at this time, and (3) the intent of the DCDCA
to eliminate sales by those persons who have been supplying clandestine laboratories.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The DCDCA requires that any person wishing to distribute, import, or export a List I chemical must obtain a registration
from DEA for each location at which such activities are carried out, prior to conducting such activities. The statutory
basis for this requirement is found in Sections 822 and 957 of the CSA, as amended by the DCDCA. Therefore, a separate
registration must be issued for each location pursuant to the factors regarding the public interest set forth in Section
823(h) of the CSA. Prior to taking final action on an application, DEA will conduct an on-site investigation at each
location for which registration is requested. The guidelines set forth in the Office of management and Budget (OMB)
Circular A&hyph;25 require that the costs of the registration process must be recovered through application fees
charged to the applicants. As noted in the fee analysis, the preregistration investigation for retail distributor
applicants will be less intensive than the investigation for other chemical applicants, due to the limited scope
and volume of a retail distributor's chemical activities. As a result, the retail distributor's fees will be significantly
less than those for non-retail chemical applicants. In addition to the cost of registration and reregistration,
it is estimated that applicants would be required to expend one-half hour per year completing the appropriate application
for registration or reregistration.

In reviewing the implementation of the registration requirement, DEA gave consideration to the specific purposes
for requiring registration and the nature of the problem of diversion of List I chemicals and made the following determinations:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. DEA will not require that persons already registered to engage in certain activities with controlled substances
obtain a separate registration for similar activities with FDA approved drug products which are regulated as List
I chemicals. A principal reason for requiring registration is to allow DEA to determine the fitness of the applicant
to conduct a specified activity and to allow DEA, if circumstances require, to prohibit the applicant from engaging
in the activity. Persons required to register with DEA to engage in activities with controlled substances are subject
to Federal and State investigations of their fitness which exceed the requirements for registration for List I chemical
activities. Further, the proposed regulation allows that DEA may remove any person's exemption from the registration
requirement and may, if appropriate, take action against the person's controlled substance registration, if the
person engages in activities in violation of the chemical laws and regulations. Accordingly, DEA is proposing in
&sect;1309.25 to exempt persons registered with DEA to handle controlled substances from the requirement to obtain
a separate chemical registration for certain similar activities with the regulated FDA approved drug products.
The exemption could potentially exempt over 70,000 hospitals, pharmacies, distributors, manufacturers, importers,
and exporters of controlled substances who are currently registered with DEA to handle controlled substances.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
2. DEA will not require persons who manufacture a List I chemical solely for internal use, with no subsequent distribution
or exportation of the chemical, to obtain a chemical registration. DEA has found that such persons have not been a source
of any significant diversion of List I chemicals; the primary sources of diversion are through the distribution channels
which deal directly with the public. If these manufacturers should later become a source of diversion, the exemption
can be removed. DEA is proposing in Section 1309.27 that such manufacturers be exempted from the chemical registration
requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DEA has also determined that the requirement that manufacturers of listed chemicals report to DEA annually can be
limited without compromising the intent of the requirement. DEA's primary interest in this area is determining the
total quantity of each individual listed chemical that is available on the domestic market. Therefore, DEA proposes
that only bulk manufacturers of the chemicals need report to DEA; other manufacturers, such as repacker/relabelers,
dosage form, etc., do not need to report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DEA has also considered the impact on small businesses of the application of the existing chemical recordkeeping
and reporting requirements to those drug products containing ephedrine which are now regulated as List I chemicals.
The recordkeeping and reporting provisions of the CDTA, as set forth in section 830 of the CSA and parts 1310 and 1313
of title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations, have been in place since 1989 and form the backbone of DEA's chemical
control program. The requirements were developed jointly with the chemical industry to provide the necessary information
to track chemical transfers while minimizing the recordkeeping and reporting burden on the chemical industry. A
retail distributor must keep records that reflect the name and address of the purchaser, the date of the transaction,
the type of chemical and amount being transferred, and the form of identification provided by the purchaser. The requirement
to make reports is limited to those transactions that are unusual or suspicious and to thefts or losses of listed chemicals.
It is estimated that creating and storing a record will require an average of one minute per record. These recordkeeping
procedures are accepted practice in the conduct of legitimate chemical commerce in the years they have been in effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DEA is obligated to implement the mandate of Congress as set out in the DCDCA. The DCDCA states that persons who wish
to manufacture, distribute, import or export List I chemicals must register with DEA. Further, the DCDCA makes drug
products containing ephedrine as the sole medicinal ingredient subject to such registration, as well as to the existing
chemical recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Consideration was given to exempting retail distributors
from the registration, recordkeeping and reporting requirements. However, such an action would negate the purpose
of the DCDCA by leaving a significant portion of the sales of regulated ephedrine products unregulated. Controlling
the diversion of these products requires monitoring and recordkeeping by all portions of the industry. DEA has proposed
steps to lessen the impact on retail distributors of the DCDCA's requirements, while simultaneously carrying out
the chemical control mandate of the DCDCA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to these proposed regulations to implement the DCDCA, DEA has published two other notices that should
be given consideration by parties concerned with the DCDCA. The first, published on March 17, 1994 (59 FR 12562), proposes
removal of the established threshold for ephedrine to reduce the diversion of ephedrine to clandestine laboratories
for the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine and methcathinone. The second, published on March 24, 1994 (59 FR
13881), establishes a temporary exemption from the registration requirements for persons who manufacture, distribute,
import or export List I chemicals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice proposes two new information collections: The DEA 510 and 510a application forms for registration and
reregistration, and the reports required from certain manufacturers of listed chemicals. DEA is submitting a request
to the Office of Management and Budget for review and approval of these new collections pursuant to the provisions
of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. et seq.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This regulation has been drafted and reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866, section 1(b), Principals
of Regulation. The DEA has determined that this rule is a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866,
section 3(f), Regulatory Planning and Review, and accordingly this rule has been reviewed by the Office of Management
and Budget.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria in Executive Order 12612, and it has been
determined that the proposed rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of
a Federalism Assessment.

existing registration is due to expire, the existing registration of the applicant shall automatically be extended
and continue in effect until the date on which the Administrator so issues his order. The Administrator may extend
any other existing registration under the circumstances contemplated in this section even though the registrant
failed to apply for reregistration at least 45 days before expiration of the existing registration, with or without
request by the registrant, if the Administrator finds that such extension is not inconsistent with the public health
and safety.

If requested by a person entitled to a hearing, the Administrator shall hold a hearing for the purpose of receiving
factual evidence regarding the issues involved in the denial, revocation, or suspension of any registration. Extensive
argument should not be offered into evidence but rather presented in opening or closing statements of counsel or in

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Any person entitled to a hearing pursuant to &sect;&sect;1309.42 and 1309.43, within the period permitted for
filing a request for a hearing, file with the Administrator a waiver of an opportunity for a hearing, together with
a written statement regarding his position on the matters of fact and law involved in such hearing. Such statement,
if admissible, shall be made a part of the record and shall be considered in light of the lack of opportunity for cross-examination
in determining the weight to be attached to matters of fact asserted therein.

General security requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) All applicants and registrants shall provide effective controls and procedures to guard against theft and diversion
of List I chemicals. Specific attention shall be paid to storage of and controlling access to List I chemicals as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Chemicals shall be stored in containers sealed in such a manner as to indicate any attempts at tampering with the
container. Where chemicals cannot be stored in sealed containers, access to the chemicals should be controlled through
physical means or through human or electronic monitoring.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In retail settings open to the public where drugs containing List I chemicals that are regulated pursuant to &sect;1310.01(f)(1)(iv)
of this chapter are distributed, such drugs will be stocked behind a counter where only employees have access.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) In evaluating the effectiveness of security controls and procedures, the Administrator shall consider the following
factors:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The type, form, and quantity of List I chemicals handled;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The location of the premises and the relationship such location bears on the security needs;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The type of building construction comprising the facility and the general characteristics of the building or
buildings;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The availability of electric detection and alarm systems;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The extent of unsupervised public access to the facility;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The adequacy of supervision over employees having access to List I chemicals;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The procedures for handling business guests, visitors, maintenance personnel, and nonemployee service personnel
in areas where List I chemicals are processed or stored;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) The adequacy of the registrant's or applicant's systems for monitoring the receipt, distribution, and disposition
of List I chemicals in its operations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The registrant shall not employ, as an agent or employee who has access to List I chemicals, any person who has been
convicted of a felony offense relating to controlled substances or listed chemicals or who has, at any time, had an
application for registration with the DEA denied, had a DEA registration revoked or has surrendered a DEA registration
for cause. For purposes of this subsection, the term ``for cause'' means a surrender in lieu of, or as a consequence
of, any Federal or State administrative, civil or criminal action resulting from an investigation of the individual's
handling of controlled substances or listed chemicals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) It is the position of DEA that employees who possess, sell, use or divert listed chemicals or controlled substances
will subject themselves not only to State or Federal prosecution for any illicit activity, but shall also immediately
become the subject of independent action regarding their continued employment. The employer will assess the seriousness
of the employee's violation, the position of responsibility held by the employee, past record of employment, etc.,
in determining whether to suspend, transfer, terminate or take other action against the employee.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Reports of listed chemical diversion by fellow employees is not only a necessary part of an overall employee security
program but also serves the public interest at large. It is, therefore, the position of DEA that an employee who has
knowledge of diversion from his employer by a fellow employee has an obligation to report such information to a responsible
security official of the employer. The employer shall treat such information as confidential and shall take all reasonable
steps to protect the confidentiality of the information and the identity of the employee furnishing information.
A failure to report information of chemical diversion will be considered in determining the feasibility of continuing
to allow an employee to work in an area with access to chemicals. The employer shall inform all employees concerning
this policy.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Each regulated person who engages in a regulated transaction must identify the other party to the transaction.
For domestic transaction, this shall be accomplished by having the other party present documents which would verify
the identity, or registration status if a registrant, of the other party to the regulated person at the time the order
is placed. For export transactions, this shall be accomplished by good faith inquiry through reasonably available
research documents or publicly available information which would indicate the existence of the foreign customer.
No proof of identity is required for foreign suppliers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The regulated person must verify the existence and apparent validity of a business entity ordering a listed chemical,
tableting machine or encapsulating machine. For domestic transactions, this may be accomplished by such methods
as checking the telephone directory, the local credit bureau, the local Chamber of Commerce or the local Better Business
Bureau, or, it the business entity is a registrant, by verification of the registration. For export transactions,
a good faith inquiry to verify the existence and apparent validity of a foreign business entity may be accomplished
by such methods as verifying the business telephone listing through international telephone information, the firm's
listing in international or foreign national chemical directories or other commerce directories of trade publications,
confirmation through foreign subsidiaries of the U.S. regulated person, verification through the country of destination's
embassy Commercial Attache, or official documents provided by the purchaser which confirm the existence and apparent
validity of the business entity.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The Administrator may remove from exemption under &sect;1310.01(f)(1)(iv) any drug or group of drugs that the
Administrator finds is being diverted to obtain a listed chemical for use in the illicit production of a controlled
substance. In removing a drug or group of drugs from the exemption the Administrator shall consider:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The scope, duration, and significance of the diversion;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Whether the drug or group of drugs is formulated in such a way that it cannot be easily used in the illicit production
of a controlled substance; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Whether the listed chemical can be readily recovered from the drug or group of drugs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Upon determining that a drug or group of drugs should be removed from the exemption under paragraph (a) of this section,
the Administrator shall issue and publish in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
his final order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The Administrator shall limit the removal of a drug or group of drugs from exemption under paragraph (a) of this
section to the most identifiable type of the drug or group of drugs for which evidence of diversion exists unless there
is evidence, based on the pattern of diversion and other relevant factors, that the diversion will not be limited to
that particular drug or group of drugs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Any manufacturer seeking reinstatement of a particular drug product that has been removed from an exemption under
paragraph (a) of this section, may apply to the Administrator for reinstatement of the exemption for that particular
drug product on the grounds that the particular drug product is manufactured and distributed in a manner that prevents
diversion. In determining whether the exemption should be reinstated the Administrator shall consider:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The package sizes manner of packaging of the drug product;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The manner of distribution and advertising of the drug product;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Evidence of diversion of the drug product;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Any actions taken by the manufacturer to prevent diversion of the drug product; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Such other factors as are relevant to and consistent with the public health and safety, including the factors described
in paragraph (a) of this section as applied to the drug product.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Indian Arts and Crafts Board was established by the Act of August 27, 1935 (49 Stat. 891; 25 U.S.C. 305a), and is responsible
for promoting the development of American Indian and Alaska Native arts and crafts, improving the economic status
of members of Federally recognized tribes, and establishing and expanding marketing opportunities for arts and
crafts produced by American Indians and Alaska Natives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1935 Act established criminal penalties for selling goods with misrepresentations that they were Indian-produced.
These original provisions, in section 1159 of title 18, United States Code, provided for fines not to exceed $500 or
imprisonment not to exceed six months or both. Although this law was in effect for many years, it provided no meaningful
deterrent to those who misrepresent imitation Indian arts and crafts. In addition, it required ``willfulness''
and ``intent'' to prove a violation, and very little enforcement took place.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In recent years, the Congress notes that the Indian arts and crafts market, with several hundred million dollars in
annual sales, was expanding and experiencing a greater frequency of fraudulent sales. The Congress requested a special
report from the Department of Commerce, which in 1985 determined that significant losses were incurred by the domestic
Indian arts and crafts market due to unmarked imported imitations. As a result, the Congress included in the 1988 Omnibus
Trade Bill, Pub. L. 100&hyph;418, a direction to the Customs Service to address the issue of misrepresentation. This
led to the promulgation of regulations to require permanent country-of-origin marking on imported Indian-style
jewelry and other arts and crafts products. Thereafter, the Congress shifted its attention to problems originating
in the domestic market and passed Pub. L. 101&hyph;644, the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990 is essentially a truth-in-advertising law designed to prevent products from
being marketed as ``Indian made,'' when the products are not, in fact, made by Indians as defined in the Act. Because
of the truth-in-advertising nature of the Act, the drafters of the proposed regulations have tried not to restrict
truthful statements that might be made in marketing a product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In respect of tribal sovereignty, the drafters do not require uniform criteria or procedures or documentation forms
for tribal certification of individuals as Indian artisans, although such uniformity would be a great convenience
to businesses and consumers in the market.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Section 309.2
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section defines terms used throughout the regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``Indian product'' is central to these regulations. It explicitly includes handcrafts because
the core of the market consists of such products, and the term ``handcraft'' carries substantial economic value when
attached to a product. It excludes products made before 1935 because, in passing the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990,
the Congress was concerned with fraudulent sales in the contemporary market. The Indian Arts and Crafts Board's mission
as an agency is to promote the development of the contemporary market. The 1935 cutoff date was chosen because that
was the founding year of the Indian Arts and Crafts Board, and the Act is an amendment to the Board's organic act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Definitions of ``Indian,'' ``Indian arts and crafts organization,'' and ``Indian tribe'' are provided in the statute.
A current list of Federally-recognized Indian tribes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on October 21, 1993 (58 FR 54364), by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, U.S. Department of the Interior. The Department
of the Interior does not maintain a list of state recognized tribes that qualify under subsection (b)(2).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 309.3
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subsection (a) of this section is particularly important because it states how the unmodified use of the word ``Indian''
or the unmodified name of an Indian tribe will be construed by the Indian Arts and Crafts Board as a representation of
an Indian product for enforcement purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act specifically addresses the situation of people of various degrees of Indian ancestry who are active in the
art market, but are not members of tribes for whatever reason. The Congress provided in the Act that tribes could decide
to certify such people as Indian artisans. There may be instances in which a person is not a member of a tribe and has not
been certified as an Indian artisan, but nonetheless is of Indian ancestry. A different identification issue arises
among people who make products that may appear Indian-made, or may be intentionally styled after Indian products,
but who have no intention of misrepresenting them as Indian-made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations need to identify a reasonable boundary between marketing statements that are simply truthful, and
should be permitted, and statements that are clearly misleading, and should be prohibited. Comments are especially
encouraged about what is reasonable and how best to establish a boundary. As proposed, the regulations provide that
the unmodified use of the word ``Indian'' or of the name of a tribe in connection with a product would necessarily be
misleading if the maker was not a member or certified artisan of a tribe.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Foreign products have been a major concern of the Congress, and the fundamental purpose of the Act is to protect Indians,
as defined, who are resident in the United States. Subsection (b) clarifies how certain marketing conduct related
to products of Indians of foreign tribes will be construed by the Indian Arts and Crafts Board for enforcement purposes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There is no collection of information in this rule requiring approval by the Office of Management and Budget under
44 U.S.C. 3504.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of the Interior certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). An unknown number of individuals,
small businesses, and tribal governments may be affected in some way, but they do not exceed several thousand in aggregate.
These possible effects, such as increased demand on tribal governments from some of their members to document their
status, stem from the statute itself rather than the proposed regulations, as the preponderance of the proposed regulations
does not exceed the non-discretionary statutory requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of the Interior has determined that these proposed regulations will not have a significant effect
on the human environment under the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321&hyph;4347). In addition, the
Department of the Interior has determined that these proposed regulations are categorically excluded from the procedural
requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act by Departmental regulations in 516 DM 2. As such, neither an
Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement has been prepared.

These regulations define the nature and Indian origin of products protected by the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990

interpret certain conduct for enforcement purposes. The Act makes it unlawful to offer or display for sale or sell
any good in a manner that falsely suggests it is Indian produced, an Indian product, or the product of a particular Indian
or Indian Tribe or Indian arts and crafts organization resident within the United States.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated September 4, 1992 (Administrative Record No. KS&hyph;533), Kansas submitted a proposed amendment

Kansas. On September 9, 1994 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 The Defense Logistics Agency proposes to exempt a system of records from certain provisions of the Privacy Act. The
system of records is identified as S100.10 GC, entitled Whistleblower Complaint and Investigation Files. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The exemption is intended to increase the value of the system of records for law enforcement purposes; to comply with
prohibitions against the disclosure of certain kinds of information; and to protect the privacy of individuals identified
in the system of records.

Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Director, Administration and Management, Office of the Secretary of Defense has determined that this Privacy
Act rule for the Department of Defense does not constitute `significant regulatory action.' Analysis of the rule
indicates that it does not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; does not create a serious inconsistency
or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; does not materially alter the budgetary
impact of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the right and obligations of recipients thereof; does
not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in Executive Order 12866 (1993).

The Director, Administration and Management, Office of the Secretary of Defense certifies that this Privacy Act
rule for the Department of Defense does not have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
because it is concerned only with the administration of Privacy Act systems of records within the Department of Defense.

The Director, Administration and Management, Office of the Secretary of Defense, certifies that this Privacy Act
rule for the Department of Defense imposes no information requirements beyond the Department of Defense and that
the information collected within the Department of Defense is necessary and consistent with 5 U.S.C. 552a, known
as the Privacy Act of 1974.

This proposed rule would add an exempt Privacy Act system of records to the DLA inventory of systems of records. DLA
performs as one of its principal functions investigations into whistleblower complaints arising from DLA employees
and the employees of DLA contractors. The proposal to exempt the system reflects recognition that certain records
in the system may be deemed to require protection from disclosure in order to protect confidential sources mentioned
in the files and avoid compromising, impeding, or interfering with investigative and enforcement proceedings.
The authority for the exemption may be found in 5 U.S.C 552a(k)(2). The system would thus be exempt from sections 552a(c)(3),
(d)(1) through (4), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (e)(4)(H), and (e)(4)(I), and (f). The Director proposes to adopt these exemptions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reasons: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
From subsection (c)(3) because granting access to the accounting for each disclosure as required by the Privacy Act,
including the date, nature, and purpose of each disclosure and the identity of the recipient, could alert the subject
to the existence of the investigation or prosecutive interest by DLA or other agencies. This could seriously compromise
case preparation by prematurely revealing its existence and nature; compromise or interfere with witnesses or make
witnesses reluctant to cooperate; and lead to suppression, alteration, or destruction of evidence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From subsections (d)(1) through (d)(4), and (f) because providing access to records of a civil investigation and
the right to contest the contents of those records and force changes to be made to the information contained therein
would seriously interfere with and thwart the orderly and unbiased conduct of the investigation and impede case preparation.
Providing access rights normally afforded under the Privacy Act would provide the subject with valuable information
that would allow interference with or compromise of witnesses or render witnesses reluctant to cooperate; lead to
suppression, alteration, or destruction of evidence; and result in the secreting of or other disposition of assets
that would make them difficult or impossible to reach in order to satisfy any Government claim growing out of the investigation
or proceeding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From subsection (e)(1), because it is not always possible to detect the relevance or necessity of each piece of information
in the early stages of an investigation. In some cases, it is only after the information is evaluated in light of other
evidence that its relevance and necessity will be clear. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From subsections (e)(4)(G) and (e)(4)(H) because there is no necessity for such publication since the system of records
will be exempt from the underlying duties to provide notification about and access to information in the system and
to make amendments to and corrections of the information in the system. However, DLA will continue to publish such
a notice in broad generic terms as is its current practice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From subsection (e)(4)(I) because to the extent that this provision is construed to require more detailed disclosure
than the broad, generic information currently published in the system notice, an exemption from this provision is
necessary to protect the confidentiality of sources of information and to protect privacy and physical safety of
witnesses and informants. DLA will, nevertheless, continue to publish such a notice in broad generic terms as is its
current practice.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The USEPA is approving, through direct final procedure, an Ohio State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision request
for the purpose of implementing an emissions statement program for stationary sources within the State's marginal
and above ozone nonattainment areas. Section 182(a)(3)(B) of title I of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA),
requires States with areas designated nonattainment for the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS)
to establish regulations for annual reporting of actual emissions by sources that emit VOC or NOx in the nonattainment
area. These emissions reports are referred to as ``emissions statements.'' Sources in the following counties are
subject to the emissions statement program requirements: Ashtabula, Butler, Clark, Clermont, Cuyahoga, Delaware,
Franklin, Geauga, Greene, Hamilton, Lake, Licking, Lorain, Lucas, Mahoning, Medina, Miami, Montgomery, Portage,
Stark, Summit, Trumbull, Warren, and Wood.

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the USEPA is approving this SIP revision request as a direct final rule without prior proposal because USEPA views
the action as noncontroversial and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is set
forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to that direct final rule, no further
activity is contemplated in relation to this proposed rule. If USEPA receives adverse public comments, the direct
final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on
this proposed rule. USEPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting
on this action should do so at this time.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under the authority of the Clean Air Act, the EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is proposing National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pollutants (NESHAP) for off-site waste and recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations. This rule would apply to owners and operators 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of facilities, with certain exceptions, that manage wastes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or recoverable materials which have been generated off-site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at another facility and contain specific organic chemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compounds listed as hazardous air pollutants (HAP). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NESHAP would require air emission controls be implemented 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for tanks, containers, surface impoundments, land disposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
units, and certain other operations used to manage, convey, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or handle wastes or recoverable materials except when the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HAP content of a waste or recoverable material meets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions specified in the rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Today's proposed rule would amend title 40, chapter I, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part 63 of the Code of Federal Regulations by adding a new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart DD_National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pollutants for Off-site Waste and Recovery Operations. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following is a summary of the requirements proposed for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA is proposing to define ``waste'' for the off-site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste and recovery operations NESHAP as any material 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generated from industrial, commercial, mining, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agricultural operations or from community activities that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discarded, discharged, or is being accumulated, stored, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physically, chemically, thermally, or biologically treated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to being discarded or discharged. This definition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would include all materials defined to be solid wastes under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including hazardous wastes. The EPA is proposing to define 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``recoverable material'' for this rulemaking as any material 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generated from industrial, commercial, mining, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agricultural operations or from community activities that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recycled, reprocessed, reused, or is being accumulated, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stored, or physically, chemically, thermally, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
biologically treated prior to being recycled, reprocessed, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or reused. Under this definition, secondary materials such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as used, surplus, and scrap materials that are recycled or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reprocessed to recover reusable materials or to create new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products would be considered by the EPA to be recoverable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials subject to this NESHAP. Waste and recoverable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material subject to the off-site waste and recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations NESHAP are collectively referred to in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule as ``regulated material.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Applicability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would apply to owners and operators 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of facilities, with certain exceptions listed below, where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations are conducted to manage, convey, or handle wastes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or recoverable materials that are received from other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities and contain hazardous air pollutants. In other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
words, the waste or recoverable material has been generated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
off-site at a separate location and, then, shipped or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transferred to the facility for subsequent management. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicable operations subject to the rule would include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage, treatment, and disposal operations as well as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recycling, recovery, and reprocessing operations. All of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these operations collectively are referred to hereafter in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this notice as ``off-site waste and recovery operations.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule would apply to off-site waste and recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations receiving regulated materials that contain one or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more of the specific organic chemicals listed in a table 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included as part of the proposed rule. These organic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemicals have been designated as hazardous air pollutants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(HAP) under CAA section 112(b), and are referred to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collectively hereafter in this notice as ``organic HAP.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Off-site waste and recovery operations managing waste or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recoverable material that does not contain any of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organic chemicals listed in the rule would not be ``regulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials'' subject to the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA is proposing that the off-site waste and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery operations NESHAP only apply to ``major sources'' as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined in the Part 63 general provisions (40 CFR 63.2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Area sources'' as defined under 40 CFR 63.2 would not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule would not apply to certain types of waste or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery operations located at an affected facility because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HAP emissions from these operations are addressed by other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA regulatory actions. The following operations at an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected facility would be exempted from the requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Units or equipment used exclusively to manage waste or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recoverable material generated at the affected facility site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i.e., waste or recoverable material generated on-site); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) municipal solid waste landfill units; (3) incinerators 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to burn waste; (4) boilers or furnaces used to burn 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulated material to produce energy; (5) units or equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
located at a publicly-owned treatment works; or (6) units or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment used exclusively to manage waste that has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received from remediation activities to cleanup wastes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designated as hazardous wastes under Resource, Conservation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Recovery Act (RCRA) rules. In addition, the off-site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste and recovery operations NESHAP would not apply to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
underground components of injection wells used for disposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. General Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The general standards proposed for the off-site waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and recovery operations NESHAP apply to major sources. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards would require that the owner or operator of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected facility control air emissions from certain waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management units and equipment in which regulated materials 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing the organic HAP listed in the rule are placed on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or after the effective date of the rule. These air emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control requirements would not apply to any affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility for which the owner or operator demonstrates that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the total annual organic HAP mass content of all regulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials subject to the rule entering the facility is less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 1 megagram per year (Mg/yr). The procedure to be used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the owner or operator to calculate the total annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organic HAP mass content of the regulated material is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified in the rule. The EPA requests comment on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed 1 Mg/yr exemption, and requests supporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information be provided with any recommendation for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative exemption level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two other provisions are proposed for the off-site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste and recovery operations NESHAP that would allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual units at an affected facility to be exempted from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the air emission control requirements of the rule. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first provision would exempt from the air emission control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements those units at major sources that exclusively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are used to manage regulated material received at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility with a volatile organic hazardous air pollutant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(VOHAP) concentration less than 100 parts per million by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weight (ppmw) on a mass-weighted average basis. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulated material VOHAP concentration would be determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on the organic HAP content of the regulated material 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the point where the facility accepts delivery or takes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possession of the regulated material, using procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified in the rule. The EPA requests comment on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definitiveness of the term ``point of entry'' as defined in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second individual unit exemption provision proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the rule would allow an owner or operator to selectively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designate, on a site-specific basis, certain individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
units to be exempt from the air emission control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements regardless of the VOHAP concentration of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulated material placed in the unit. Application of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discretionary exemption by the owner or operator would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited based on regulated material organic HAP content. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this provision, the total annual organic HAP mass 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
content in the regulated materials placed in all of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
units designated by the owner or operator as exempt units 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could not exceed 1 Mg/yr as determined in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the procedures specified in the rule. The EPA requests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment on the structure of the proposed 1 Mg/yr exemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for individual units, as well as supporting information for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any recommendation for an alternative exemption level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For tanks, surface impoundments, containers, conveyance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems, and certain treatment units required to use air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission controls under the off-site waste and recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations NESHAP, the owner or operator would be required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to either: (1) Install and operate air emission controls on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the unit in accordance with standards specified in the rule; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or (2) treat the regulated material before the regulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material is placed in the unit to remove or destroy organic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HAP in accordance with requirements specified in the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For land disposal units and other miscellaneous units 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to the air emission control requirements of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule, the owner or operator would be required to treat the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulated material before the regulated material is placed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the unit to remove or destroy organic HAP in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the requirements specified in the rule. In addition to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these requirements, the rule would require that the owner or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator of an affected facility control organic HAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions from leaks in certain ancillary equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e.g., pumps, valves, flanges, etc.) used to handle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulated material streams having a total organic HAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration equal to or greater than 10 percent by weight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed rule, an owner or operator would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowed to use any type of treatment process to reduce the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organic HAP content of the regulated material that can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuously achieve the performance requirements specified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the rule. Several alternative treatment process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance standards are specified in the proposed rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from which the owner or operator could choose to comply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These standards would allow the use of a treatment process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that achieves any of the following conditions: (1) the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actual VOHAP concentration of the regulated material exiting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the treatment process is less than 100 ppmw or the VOHAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration limit established for the process, whichever 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value is lower; (2) the HAP reduction efficiency for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment process is equal to or greater than 95 percent, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the VOHAP concentration of the regulated material 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exiting the treatment process is less than 50 ppmw; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) the actual HAP mass removal for the treatment process is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater than the required mass removal established for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process.

3. Tank Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The tank standards proposed for the off-site waste and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery operations NESHAP would establish the requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for tanks using air emission controls to comply with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general standards of the rule. No air emission controls 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be required under the rule for a tank in which all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulated material placed in the unit has been treated to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remove or destroy organic HAP in accordance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements specified in the general standards. Also, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tank standards would not apply to a tank in which biological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment of a regulated material is performed under certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions specified in the rule; or to a tank designated by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the owner or operator to be exempted from using air emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controls in accordance with the rule provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed air emission control requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tanks would be applied based on the tank design capacity, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the maximum HAP vapor pressure of the regulated material in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the tank, and whether the tank is designated an ``existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tank'' or a ``new tank'' under the provisions of 40 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part 63. Both existing tanks and new tanks in which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum HAP vapor pressure of the regulated material in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tank is equal to or greater than 76.6 kPa (approximately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11.1 psi), would be required (regardless of tank design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capacity) to manage the regulated material in a tank using a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cover that is connected through a closed-vent system to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control device. For affected tanks in which the maximum HAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vapor pressure of the regulated material in the tank is less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 76.6 kPa, different standards are proposed for existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tanks and for new tanks depending on the tank design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capacity.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposed tank standards for existing tanks in which the maximum HAP vapor pressure of the regulated material
in the tank is less than 76.6 kPa, use of air emission controls would be required on tanks having a design capacity equal
to or greater than 75 m3 (approximately 20,000 gallons). No air emission controls would be required under the rule
for an existing tank having a design capacity less than 75 m3. For tanks having a design capacity equal to or greater
than 75 m3, an owner or operator would be required to install and operate air emission controls in accordance with the
rule requirements. These requirements specify that, unless the maximum HAP vapor pressure of the regulated material
in the tank is less than certain limits specified in the rule, the owner or operator install and operate on the tank one
of the following air emission control systems: (1) A cover that is connected through a closed-vent system to a control
device; (2) a fixed-roof type cover with an internal floating roof that is designed and operated in accordance with
the requirements of the new source performance standard (NSPS) for volatile organic liquid (VOL) storage under 40
CFR 60.112b(a)(1); (3) an external floating roof that is designed and operated in accordance with the requirements
of the VOL storage NSPS under 40 CFR 60.112b(a)(2); or (4) a pressure tank that is designed to operate as a closed system.
Under the proposed rule, an owner or operator would be allowed to use a fixed-roof type cover (without any additional
controls) for existing tanks having a capacity less than 151 m3 (approximately 40,000 gallons) when the maximum HAP
vapor pressure of the regulated material in the tank is less than 27.6 kPa (approximately 4.0 psi), and for larger capacity
tanks when the maximum HAP vapor pressure of the regulated material in the tank is less than 5.2 kPa (approximately
0.75 psi). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed standards for new tanks in which the maximum HAP vapor pressure of the regulated material in the tank is
less than 76.6 kPa would require the use of air emission controls on tanks having a design capacity equal to or greater
than 38 m3 (approximately 10,000 gallons). The same types of air emission control systems specified in the proposed
rule for existing tanks (e.g., vent to control device, use floating roof, pressure tank, or use of fixed-roof type
covers under certain conditions) would apply to new tanks with the exception that the maximum HAP vapor pressure limits
allowed for using fixed-roof type covers without additional controls are lower for new tanks than existing tanks.
An owner or operator would be allowed to use a fixed-roof type cover without additional controls for new tanks having
a capacity less than 151 m3 when the maximum HAP vapor pressure of the regulated material in the tank is less than 13.1
kPa (approximately 1.9 psi), and for larger capacity tanks when the maximum HAP vapor pressure of the regulated material
in the tank is less than 0.7 kPa (approximately 0.1 psi). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed maximum HAP vapor pressure limits selected for existing tanks that would be allowed to use fixed-roof
type covers without additional controls are based on the waste vapor pressure limits established for tanks at hazardous
waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSDF) subject to air rules being developed by the EPA under authority
of RCRA section 3004(n) (refer to 56 FR 33490). For today's proposed rulemaking, the EPA considered using the maximum
vapor pressure limits established for tanks under the NESHAP for the synthetic organic chemical manufacturing (SOCMI)
industry (40 CFR 63 subpart G). Because the sources subject to both the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP
and the RCRA air rules are similar, the EPA believes it is appropriate to use the maximum vapor pressure limits established
for the RCRA air rules for today's proposed rulemaking also. The EPA requests comment on the selection of the maximum
HAP vapor pressure limits proposed for the air emission control requirements for tanks under the off-site waste and
recovery operations NESHAP.

4. Surface Impoundment Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed air emission control requirements are the same for existing surface impoundments and new surface impoundments.
These requirements would not apply to either: a surface impoundment in which all regulated material placed in the
unit has been treated to remove or destroy organic HAP in accordance with the requirements specified in the general
standards; a surface impoundment in which biological treatment of a regulated material is performed under certain
conditions specified in the rule; or a surface impoundment designated by the owner or operator to be exempted from
using air emission controls in accordance with rule provisions. For each surface impoundment required to use air
emission controls, the owner or operator would be required to use either: a cover that is connected to a closed-vent
system vented to a control device; or a floating membrane cover that is designed and operated in accordance with requirements
specified in the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

5. Container Standards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed air emission control requirements are the same for existing and new containers. These requirements
would not apply to either: a container having a design capacity less than or equal to 0.1 m3 (approximately 26 gallons);
a container in which all regulated material placed in the unit has been treated to remove or destroy organic HAP in accordance
with the requirements specified in the general standards; or a container designated by the owner or operator to be
exempted from using air emission controls in accordance with rule provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For containers used for storage, treatment, and handling of regulated material, the owner or operator would be required
to use either: (1) a container that is equipped with a vapor leak-tight cover; (2) a container having a design capacity
less than or equal to 0.42 m3 (approximately 110 gallons) that is equipped with a cover and complies with all applicable
U.S. Department of Transportation regulations on packaging hazardous waste for transport under 49 CFR part 178;
or (3) a container that is attached to or forms a part of any truck, trailer, or railcar and that has been demonstrated
within the preceding 12 months to be organic HAP vapor tight in accordance with the procedure specified in the rule.
For containers in which treatment of regulated material is performed, the owner or operator would be required to place
the container inside an enclosure that is connected through a closed-vent system to a control device at all times that
the container is completely or partially uncovered during the treatment operation. Transfer of regulated material
by pumping into a container having a design capacity greater than 0.42 m3 would be required to be performed using submerged
fill loading.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP would regulate organic HAP emissions from process vents
on enclosed treatment units. Under the proposed rule, an ``enclosed treatment unit'' would be defined as a stationary,
enclosed unit used for the purpose of treating or processing a regulated material, and for which all materials only
enter or exit the unit through enclosed pipes or process vents while the unit is operating. Examples of an enclosed
treatment unit include a distillation pot, distillation column, thin-film evaporator, solvent extraction tower,
steam stripping tower, and air stripping tower. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed air emission control requirements are the same for existing units and new units. These requirements
would not apply to either: an enclosed treatment unit in which all regulated material placed in the unit has been treated
to remove or destroy organic HAP in accordance with the requirements specified in the general standards; or an enclosed
treatment unit designated by the owner or operator to be exempted from using air emission controls in accordance with
rule provisions. For each enclosed treatment unit required to use air emission controls, the owner or operator would
be required to connect each process vent on the unit to a closed-vent system vented to a control device.

7. Conveyance System Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP would establish requirements for conveyance systems
to control organic HAP emissions occurring during the transfer of a regulated material containing organic HAP between
two regulated material management units using air emission controls in accordance with the rule requirements. Under
the proposed rule, a ``conveyance system'' would be defined as a device other than a container used to transfer material
to or from tanks, containers, surface impoundments, enclosed treatment units, or other regulated material management
units. Examples of a conveyance system include a pipeline, individual drain system (with all associated drains,
junction boxes, and sewer lines), channel, flume, gravity-operated conveyor (such as a chute), and mechanically-powered
conveyor (such as a belt or screw conveyor). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed air emission control requirements are the same for existing conveyance systems and new conveyance systems.
These requirements would not apply to either: a conveyance system in which all regulated material placed in the unit
has been treated to remove or destroy organic HAP in accordance with the requirements specified in the general standards;
or a conveyance system designated by the owner or operator to be exempted from using air emission controls in accordance
with rule provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For each conveyance system required to use air emission controls, the owner or operator would be required to use one
of the following systems: (1) a conveyance system which uses a cover that is connected through a closed-vent system
to a control device; (2) a conveyance system which uses an enclosure that is connected through a closed-vent system
to a control device; (3) a conveyance system which is designed and operated as an enclosed pipeline in which all joints
or seams between the pipe sections are permanently or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
semi-permanently sealed (e.g., a welded joint between two sections of metal pipe or a bolted and gasketed flange);
(4) a conveyance system which is designed and operated as an individual drain system in accordance with the requirements
of 40 CFR 61.346(a)(1) or 40 CFR 61.346 (b)(1) through (b)(3); or (5) any other conveyance system which is designed
to operate as a closed system such that the conveyance system operates with no detectable emissions (as determined
by procedures specified under the rule) at all times that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulated material is in the conveyance system except under certain conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
8. Equipment Leak Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP would require owners and operators of affected facilities
to control organic HAP emissions from leaks in pumps, compressors, pressure relief devices, sampling connection
systems, open-ended valves or lines, valves, flanges and other connectors, and product accumulator vessels that
either contain or contact a regulated material which is a fluid (liquid or gas) and has a total organic HAP concentration
equal to or greater than 10 percent by weight. The equipment leak standards would not apply to equipment that operates
less than 300 hours per calendar year, or equipment for which the owner or operator is already complying with the requirements
of 40 CFR 63 subpart H. For each equipment component subject to this standard at either an existing source or a new source,
the owner or operator would be required to perform the leak detection and repair program and implement the equipment
modifications required under 40 CFR 61.241 through 61.247. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
9. Air Emission Control Equipment Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Specific design, performance, and operating requirements are proposed for each cover, closed-vent system, and
control device installed by the owner or operator to comply with the tank, surface impoundment, container, conveyance
system, enclosed treatment unit standards of the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed requirements for covers are determined by the type of cover used and the type of regulated material management
unit on which the cover is installed. Requirements are specified for vapor-leak tight covers (i.e covers that operate
with no detectable emissions as determined by procedures specified under the rule), external and internal floating
roofs installed on tanks, floating membrane covers installed on surface impoundments, and container enclosures
requiring continuous or frequent worker access.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each closed-vent system would be required to operate with no detectable emissions (as determined by procedures specified
under the rule). For the proposed rule, any control device could be used that reduces the mass content of either total
organic compounds (less methane and ethane) or total HAP in the gases vented to the device by 95 percent by weight or
greater. An owner or operator would be allowed to comply with alternative performance requirements for enclosed
combustion devices (e.g., thermal vapor incinerators, catalytic vapor incinerators, boilers, and process heaters)
and for flares.

10. Test Methods and Compliance Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For affected units using air emission controls in accordance with the rule requirements, no regulated material determination
would be required under the proposed rule. An owner or operator would be required to determine the VOHAP concentration
or organic HAP vapor pressure of the regulated material being managed in the unit not using air emission controls in
accordance with the requirements of the standards. Either analysis of regulated material samples using procedures
specified in the rule or the owner's or operator's knowledge of the regulated material could be used could be used for
a regulated material determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The owner or operator would determine that covers and closed-vent system operates with no detectable emissions by
visual inspection and testing the equipment in accordance with the procedures specified in Method 21 under 40 CFR
60 appendix A. Test procedures for control devices would be consistent with procedures specified in existing NESHAP.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
11. Monitoring and Inspection Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To ensure that the air emission control equipment is properly operated and maintained, the proposed off-site waste
and recovery operations NESHAP would require that the owner or operator periodically inspect and monitor this equipment.
Visual inspections and leak detection monitoring using Method 21 would be required for certain types of covers to
ensure gaskets and seals are in good condition, and for closed-vent systems to ensure all fittings remain leak-tight.
In general, semi-annual inspection and leak detection monitoring of covers is proposed. Annual inspection and leak
detection monitoring would be required for closed-vent systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Continuous monitoring of control device operation would be required under the proposed rule. This would involve
the use of automated instrumentation to measure and record appropriate control device operating parameters that
indicate whether the control device is in compliance with the applicable performance requirements of the rule. A
more detailed explanation of these proposed monitoring requirements for control devices is presented in section
V.E.1 of this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In cases when an owner or operator complies with the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP by treating a regulated
material to remove or destroy HAP before placing the regulated material in a unit, the EPA is proposing that the owner
or operator monitor appropriate operating parameters for the treatment process as described in section V.E.2 of
this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
12. Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP would require that the owner or operator to maintain certain
records and submit to the EPA certain reports consistent with the recordkeeping and reporting requirements for all
NESHAP as specified in the Part 63 general provisions (40 CFR 63 subpart A). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Summary of Rule Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Implementation of the proposed off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP would result in substantial reductions
in organic HAP emissions to the atmosphere from off-site waste and recovery operations located in the United States.
Furthermore, many of the organic HAP emitted from the off-site waste and recovery operations source category are
also volatile organic compounds (VOC). These VOC react photochemically with other chemical compounds in the atmosphere
to form ozone. Although the NESHAP proposed today would not specifically require control of VOC emissions from off-site
waste and recovery operations, the organic emission control technologies upon which today's rulemaking is based
would also significantly reduce VOC emissions from the source category. The EPA estimates that implementation of
the proposed off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP would reduce nationwide organic HAP emissions by approximately
43,000 Mg/yr and reduce nationwide VOC emissions by approximately 52,000 Mg/yr.

The EPA prepared estimates of the cost to owners and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators of implementing the requirements of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP at facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected to be subject to the rule. The total nationwide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capital investment cost to purchase and install the air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission controls that would be required by the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule is estimated by the EPA to be approximately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$49 million. The total nationwide annual cost of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP, as proposed, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is estimated to be approximately $24.5 million per year.

A. Section 112 Statutory Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 112 of the Clean Air Act (CAA) regulates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stationary sources of hazardous air pollutants (HAP). This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section was comprehensively amended under Title III of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. The term ``stationary source'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
means any building, structure, facility, or installation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that emits or may emit air pollutants. Under the amended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CAA section 112(b), Congress listed 189 chemicals, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compounds, or groups of chemicals as HAP. The EPA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directed by the CAA section 112 to regulate the emission of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these HAP from stationary sources by establishing national 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission standards (i.e., NESHAP). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A 1990 amendment to section 112(c) of the CAA requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the EPA to develop and publish a list of source categories 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that emit HAP for which NESHAP will be developed. The EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is required to list all known categories and subcategories 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of ``major sources.'' The term ``major source'' is defined by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the CAA to mean ``any stationary source or group of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stationary sources located within a contiguous area and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under common control that emits or has the potential to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emit, considering controls, in the aggregate 10 tons per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year (ton/yr) or more of any HAP or 25 ton/yr or more of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combination of HAP.'' The EPA's initial list of categories 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of major sources of HAP emissions was published in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 16, 1992 (57 FR 31576). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For each NESHAP source category listed by EPA, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards must be developed to control HAP emissions from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both new sources and existing sources in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific statutory directives set out in CAA section 112, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended. The statute requires the EPA to establish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards under a NESHAP to reflect the maximum degree of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction in HAP emissions through application of maximum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achievable control technology (MACT). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A statutory minimum or baseline to the level of HAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission control that the EPA can select to be MACT for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular source category is defined under CAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 112(d)(3). This minimum HAP emission control level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is referred as the ``MACT floor.'' For new sources, the MACT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
floor is the level of HAP emission control that is achieved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in practice by the best controlled similar source. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statute allows standards under a NESHAP for existing sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be less stringent than standards for new sources. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination of MACT floor for existing sources is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dependent on the nationwide number of existing sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the source category. For a source category with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30 or more existing sources, the MACT floor is the average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission limitation achieved by the best performing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12 percent of the existing sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once the MACT floors are determined for new and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing sources in a source category, the EPA must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish standards under a NESHAP that are no less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stringent than the applicable MACT floors. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator may promulgate standards that are more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stringent than the MACT floor when such standards are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined by the EPA to be achievable taking into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration the cost of implementing the standards as well 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as any non-air quality health and environmental impacts and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
energy requirements listed in CAA section 112(d)(2). All 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owners and operators of sources within the source category 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must comply with the promulgated NESHAP.

B. Listing of Source Category 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On the EPA's initial list of HAP emission source 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categories published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 16, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1992 (57 FR 31576), the EPA included one source category 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the Agency intended to represent those off-site waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and recovery operations that are not specifically listed as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a separate, distinct NESHAP source category such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazardous waste incineration or municipal solid waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
landfills. This source category was titled on the initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
list as ``solid waste treatment, storage, and disposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities.'' Since the initial source category list was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published, the EPA decided that it is appropriate to change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the title of this NESHAP source category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Effective by this notice, the EPA is changing the title 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the NESHAP source category subject to today's proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule to ``off-site waste and recovery operations.'' This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change is appropriate for two reasons: (1) To avoid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confusion with the terms ``solid waste'' and ``treatment, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage, and disposal facilities'' which have specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meanings within the context of statutory and regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements in existing rules established by the EPA under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(RCRA); and (2) to better distinguish the types of air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission sources addressed by this NESHAP source category 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from other NESHAP source categories.

Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA published an advance notice of proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking (ANPR) in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 20, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993 (58 FR 66336) announcing the EPA's intent to develop a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NESHAP for the off-site waste and recovery operations source 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
category. The purpose of the ANPR was to inform owners and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators of affected industries and the general public of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the planned scope of the NESHAP rulemaking for the off-site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste and recovery operations source category, and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solicit information that would aid in the development of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To supplement the Agency's information regarding the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
off-site waste and recovery operations source category, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA requested comments from the public on the ANPR. The EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically requested more information on wastes and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recoverable materials characteristics (types, quantities, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organic composition), waste management practices, and waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and recoverable material operations emission points and air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission data. A 30-day comment period, from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
December 20, 1993 to January 19, 1994, was provided for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interested parties to submit comments on the ANPR. The EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received written comments from 16 commenters concerning the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ANPR. These comments were considered by the EPA in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development of the proposed off-site waste and recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations NESHAP.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many industrial sectors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that manage wastes or recoverable materials containing HAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are listed as specific NESHAP source categories on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial EPA source category list (57 FR 31576, July 16, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1992). For example, plants and facilities in the NESHAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source categories representing the synthetic organic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical manufacturing industry, the petroleum refining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry, the pesticide manufacturing industry, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pharmaceutical manufacturing industry frequently manage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some, if not all, of the wastes and recoverable materials 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generated by the manufacturing processes operated at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities at the same location where the materials are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generated (i.e, on-site). For NESHAP source categories in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which operations to manage waste or recoverable material may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occur at the same facility where the material is generated, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the EPA is addressing HAP emissions from the management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations as part of the NESHAP being developed for that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular source category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NESHAP rule proposed today under 40 CFR 63 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart DD would apply only to those operations used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manage, convey, or handle waste or recoverable material 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing organic HAP which have been generated at other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities but are not specifically listed as a NESHAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source category. On EPA's initial list of HAP emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source categories, the following operations are listed as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate NESHAP source categories: municipal solid waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(MSW) landfills; publicly-owned treatment works (POTW); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sewage sludge incinerators; hazardous waste incineration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
units; boilers and industrial furnaces; and hazardous waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remediation activities. For these source categories, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate NESHAP under 40 CFR part 63 are being developed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA establishes rules for the management of solid wastes under authority of the Resource Conservation and Recovery
Act (RCRA). Under authority of subtitle C of RCRA, the EPA has established rules regulating the management of solid
wastes determined to be hazardous waste (refer to 40 CFR Parts 260 through 271). Municipal solid wastes and other types
of nonhazardous solid wastes are regulated by rules established under authority of subtitle D of RCRA (e.g., refer
to 40 CFR Parts 257 and 258).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Definition of Waste.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP, the EPA is proposing definitions of ``waste'' and ``recoverable
materials'' that are consistent with the definitions used by the EPA for other air rules promulgated under the CAA
(selection of this definition is explained further in section IV.A of this notice). These definitions define the
types of materials considered to be a ``waste'' or ``recoverable material'' in a broader context than the definition
of ``solid waste'' that the EPA has historically used for RCRA rulemakings. The proposed definition of ``waste''
for the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP includes all materials defined to be solid wastes under RCRA
rules including hazardous wastes. In addition, materials excluded from the RCRA definition of solid waste such as
recovered materials recycled back to a process unit and used oil reprocessed for sale as a fuel are included in the definition
of ``recoverable material'' proposed for the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP. As a result, certain
off-site waste and recovery operations exempted from RCRA rules may be subject to the requirements of the NESHAP rule
proposed today. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Duplicative Requirements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 At many facilities where hazardous wastes are managed and wastes are received from off-site, both the off-site waste
and recovery operations NESHAP proposed today and existing RCRA air rules under 40 CFR parts 264 and 265 would likely
be applicable to the facilities. At these facilities, some operations would be subject to either air emission standards
under the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP or the air emissions standards under the RCRA air rules. However,
in certain situations, some operations would be subject to air emission standards under both sets of rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CAA requires that the requirements of rules developed under the Act be consistent, but avoid duplication, with
requirements of rules developed under RCRA. Certain testing, monitoring, inspection, recordkeeping, and other
requirements of the proposed off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP also would be required under the RCRA
air rules. The EPA believes that each of these requirements is necessary to assure compliance with and enforce the
rules. However, it is unnecessary for owners and operators of those facilities subject to both the off-site waste
and recovery operations NESHAP and the RCRA air rules to conduct duplicative waste testing, keep duplicate sets of
records, or perform other duplicative actions for the same waste or recoverable material operation. Thus, the EPA
requests comment on how applicable requirements under the RCRA air rules should be incorporated into the off-site
waste and recovery operations NESHAP to allow owners and operators to demonstrate compliance with both rules without
having to repeat duplicative requirements.

3. Pollution Prevention Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 13101 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, Pub. L. 101&hyph;508, November 5, 1990) establishes the national policy of the United States for pollution prevention.
This act declares that: (1) pollution should be prevented or reduced whenever feasible; (2) pollution that cannot
be prevented or reduced should be recycled or reused in an environmentally-safe manner wherever feasible; (3) pollution
that cannot be recycled or reused should be treated; and (4) disposal or release into the atmosphere should be chosen
only as a last resort. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Opportunities for applying pollution prevention to the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP are basically
limited to pollution treatment prior to disposal or release into the atmosphere. By definition, the off-site waste
and recovery operations source category consists of operations used to manage materials that have already been generated
at other locations such as a manufacturing plant. Thus, there are no pollution prevention practices such as modifying
the manufacturing process to reduce the quantity of materials containing organic HAP generated or to recycle the
materials back to the process which can be implemented once the material arrives at an off-site waste and recovery
operations facility. The EPA has incorporated the pollution prevention policy into the proposed rule by requiring
wastes and recoverable materials containing organic HAP be treated to remove or destroy organic HAP prior to management
in units open to the environment. Thus, to the extent possible, pollution prevention has been considered in the development
of this rulemaking. Today's proposed NESHAP for the off-site waste and recovery operations source category is consistent
with the pollution prevention policy.

A. Hazardous Air Pollutant Types 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The specific chemicals, compounds, or groups of compounds designated by Congress to be HAP are listed in CAA section
112(b). Both organic and inorganic chemical compounds are included on this HAP list. The EPA noted in the ANPR for the
off-site waste and recovery operations source category its intent to regulate under this NESHAP only organic compounds
which have been listed as HAP (58 FR 66337). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA decided not to regulate under the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP proposed today emissions
of the metals and other inorganic chemical compounds listed as HAP. The primary source of inorganic HAP emissions
from off-site waste and recovery operations is combustion units such as waste incinerators and boilers and industrial
furnaces burning wastes or recoverable materials for energy. As explained in section II.D.1 of this notice, the EPA
is addressing HAP emissions from these combustion sources under separate regulatory actions. Furthermore, the
data available to the EPA do not suggest that significant quantities of inorganic HAP are emitted to the air from the
off-site waste and recovery operations that would be subject to this NESHAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many different types of organic HAP potentially can be emitted from off-site waste and recovery operations facilities
because of the wide variety of manufacturing processes and other sources which generate the materials sent to these
facilities. Selection of the specific organic HAP chemicals for regulation under the off-site waste and recovery
operations NESHAP is explained further in section IV.A of this notice.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Off-site waste and recovery operations are conducted at many different types of facilities. Some of these facility
types are listed as a specific NESHAP source category. The off-site waste and recovery operations source category
is intended to represent all of the other facilities where off-waste and recovery operations are conducted but are
not specifically included under another NESHAP source category. Based on this premise, the EPA identified the following
types of facilities described below to be included (but not limited to) in the off-site waste and recovery operations
source category.

1. Hazardous Waste TSDF 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the RCRA rules regulating the management of wastes determined to be hazardous waste, the EPA has established
a permit system for owners and operators of facilities where operations are conducted to treat, store, or dispose
of a RCRA hazardous waste. A facility subject to RCRA permitting requirements is termed a treatment, storage, and
disposal facility (TSDF). A RCRA hazardous waste may be generated on the same site where a TSDF is located, or may be
generated at one site and then transported to a TSDF at a separate location. Wastes not designated as RCRA hazardous
waste are also managed at some TSDF. Although a waste may not specifically designated as a RCRA hazardous waste, this
waste can still contain significant quantities of organic constitutes listed as HAP under the CAA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA has conducted nationwide surveys to collect information regarding hazardous waste management practices.
Data from the most recent surveys indicate that approximately 2,300 TSDF were operating in the United States in 1986.
At 710 of these TSDF, owners and operators reported managing RCRA hazardous wastes that are generated off-site. The
EPA survey data indicate that approximately 240 of the 710 TSDF that receive waste from off-site also manage wastes
other than RCRA hazardous waste.

Many landfill facilities throughout the Unites States are dedicated to the disposal of solid wastes other than those
defined as RCRA hazardous wastes. Landfills accepting household wastes are defined under RCRA rules to be municipal
solid waste (MSW) landfill units. No MSW landfill units are included in the off-site waste and recovery operations
source category because these units are listed as a separate NESHAP source category. However, some other landfills
are operated by waste management companies that will accept only industrial nonhazardous wastes (i.e., these landfills
do not accept any household waste or RCRA hazardous waste).

The EPA estimates that there are approximately 10 industrial landfills currently operating that accept only nonhazardous
industrial process wastes. These landfills receive a wide range of wastes that may contain significant amounts of
organic HAP. Furthermore, the EPA estimates that nationwide there are approximately an additional 1,800 construction
and demolition debris landfills currently in operation that can be included in this segment of the off-site waste
and recovery operations source category. However, the EPA does not expect wastes received at construction and demolition
debris landfills to contain significant amounts of organic HAP.

3. Industrial Wastewater Treatment Facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Analogous to landfills, many waste treatment facilities are operated by municipal governments and private companies
throughout the United States for the treatment of wastewaters. Wastewater treatment facilities accepting residential
and commercial wastewaters are considered to be publicly owned-treatment works (POTW). No POTW are included in the
off-site waste and recovery operations source category because POTW are listed as a separate NESHAP source category.
In addition to POTW, some privately-owned wastewater treatment facilities process nonhazardous wastewaters received
from off-site sources. A nationwide survey was conducted by the EPA of wastewater treatment facilities operating
in 1989. Using these survey data, a data base excluding POTW was created. The results of this survey indicate that 15
wastewater treatment facilities were operating nationwide which were neither a POTW nor a hazardous waste TSDF but
did process wastewaters received from off-site sources that potentially could generate wastewaters containing
organic HAP.

4. Recycled Used Oil Management Facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Used oils from motor vehicles and other sources potentially can contain organic chemicals, such as benzene, which
have been listed as HAP under CAA section 112(b). Although the management of used oils which are recycled is regulated
by separate rules promulgated by the EPA under authority of RCRA section 3014, these rules do not address air emissions
from used oil management facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA gathered information regarding recycled used oil management practices in the United States for the development
of the RCRA standards. This information indicates that approximately 2,800 million liters of used oil enters the
commercial used oil recycling market each year. Approximately three-fourths of this recycled used oil is sent to
facilities categorized by EPA as ``used oil processors.'' Used oil processors typically collect used motor oil and
industrial lubricating oils. These oils are processed to remove water and sediments from the oils. The processors
then sell the oil as a fuel for burning primarily in boilers, furnaces, and space heaters. There were 182 used oil processing
facilities operating in the United States in 1991. The remainder of the recycled used oil is sent to facilities categorized
as ``used oil re-refiners.'' At these facilities the used oil is processed into base lube oil stocks and other products.
In 1991, there were four used oil re-refining facilities operating in the United States. Several companies have expressed
interest in expanding used oil re-refining capacity in the United States.

5. Oil and Gas E&amp;P Waste Management Facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are a variety of wastes and recoverable materials generated during oil and gas exploration and production (E&amp;P).
The majority of these materials are managed on-site at the production site (i.e., at the location of the well). However,
some E&amp;P wastes and recoverable materials generated at the production site that may contain organic HAP are subsequently
sent to off-site crude oil reclamation and land treatment facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA gathered information regarding E&amp;P waste and recoverable material management practices from EPA conducted
site visits and existing industry sponsored surveys. Nationwide, approximately 100,000 Mg/yr of E&amp;P wastes
and recoverable materials are sent to off-site crude oil reclamation facilities. These materials consist mostly
of tank bottoms from crude oil storage tanks or produced water storage tanks. In addition, approximately 135,000
Mg/yr of E&amp;P waste sludges are managed in off-site land treatment operations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to facilities that are in business to manage wastes or recoverable materials received from other generators,
some facilities that provide support services may indirectly receive wastes or recoverable materials which are
potential organic HAP emission sources. Two types of such facilities have been identified by the EPA: (1) Facilities
where empty drums previously used to hold wastes or recoverable containing organics are cleaned and reconditioned
for reuse; and (2) truck terminal facilities at which tank trucks used for chemical waste or recoverable material
transport are cleaned and rinsed prior to being used to transport a new load. At both of these types of facilities, organic
HAP emissions can occur from the wastewater treatment system operated at the facility to treat the wastes and cleaning
solutions drained from drums or truck tanks as a result of the container cleaning operation. Wastewater treatment
operations are expected to be the primary source of organic HAP emissions at these types of facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The need for and frequency of cleaning a drum and tank truck depends on the type of service in which the container is used.
If drums and tank trucks are reused for the same type of product or wastes (i.e., dedicated service), the containers
do not need to be cleaned between each use. Only when a drum or tank truck is used for different types of products or wastes
(i.e, nondedicated service) is there frequent cleaning of the containers. Of the approximately 45 million drums
used annually in the United States, about 5.6 million are estimated to be in nondedicated service. Approximately
20,000 tank trucks of the nationwide total of 91,000 are estimated to be in nondedicated service.

C. Nationwide Organic HAP Emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA estimated organic HAP emissions from typical or average size facilities in each of the off-site waste and recovery
operations facility segments described in the previous section of this notice using the best information available
to the Agency at the time the estimates were completed. The type, amount, and date of this information varied for each
of the different off-site waste and recovery operation facility segments. The estimate results are presented in
the BID for this proposed rulemaking. Based on these estimates, the EPA identified the following off-site waste and
recovery operations facility segments likely to include some individual facilities that are major sources of HAP
emissions as defined under CAA section 112: (1) Hazardous waste TSDF; (2) industrial waste landfills other than construction
and demolition debris landfills; (3) industrial wastewater treatment facilities; (4) crude oil reclamation facilities
and E&amp;P waste land treatment facilities; and (5) used oil re-refining facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA estimates that there are the following numbers of existing off-site waste and recovery operations facilities
in the United States: 710 hazardous waste TSDF receiving wastes from off-site; 10 industrial waste landfills receiving
nonhazardous industrial waste other than construction and demolition debris from off-site; 15 privately-owned
industrial wastewater treatment facilities; 11 crude oil reclamation facilities; 15 E&amp;P waste land treatment
facilities; and 4 used oil re-refineries. Many but not all of these facilities would be designated as major sources
of HAP emissions as defined under CAA section 112. Insufficient information is available the EPA to project numbers
for new off-site waste and recovery operations facilities. The EPA is requesting information from affected industries
and other interested parties to improve the Agency's profile of existing and new off-site waste and recovery operations
in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total nationwide organic HAP emissions from the off-site waste and recovery operations source category are estimated
by the EPA to be approximately 51,500 megagrams of organic HAP per year (Mg/yr). Approximately 90 percent of these
organic HAP emissions (approximately 46,000 Mg/yr) are estimated to occur from the operations at hazardous waste
TSDF receiving waste or recoverable materials from off-site.

IV. Development of Regulatory Alternatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Selection of Source Category and Pollutants for Control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Off-site waste and recovery operations were included as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a source category on the EPA's initial list of HAP source 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categories (refer to section II.B of this notice). As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously explained, the EPA intends this source category 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to address HAP emissions only from those waste and recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations that are not included in another separate NESHAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source category or are being addressed by other EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory actions. Consequently, the following waste and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery operations that receive materials from other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities are specifically excluded from the off-site waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and recovery operations source category because these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations have been listed by the EPA as separate NESHAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source categories: hazardous waste incineration, municipal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solid waste landfills, publicly-owned treatment works, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sewage sludge incinerators, site remediation activities, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industrial boilers and process heaters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wastes and recoverable materials sent to the facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selected for regulation under the off-site waste and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery operations NESHAP are generated by a wide variety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of manufacturing and production processes as well as other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recycling, reprocessing, or waste management operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, many of the organic chemicals or groups of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemicals listed as HAP under CAA section 112(b) may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present in the wastes or recoverable materials sent to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
off-site waste and recovery operations facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is not appropriate to select all organic HAP listed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under CAA section 112(b) for regulation under the off-site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste and recovery operations NESHAP. Some specific organic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemicals that are designated as HAP have no or minimal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential to be emitted to the atmosphere from off-site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste and recovery operations. For other organic HAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemicals that may be emitted from off-site waste and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery operations, there are limits to the detectability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of some of these chemicals in wastes by the test methods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently available to implement the off-site waste and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery operations NESHAP because of properties inherent in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the sampling and analysis protocol. Consequently, the EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decided it is appropriate to develop a list of the specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organic HAP chemicals to be regulated by this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To select which organic HAP chemicals would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulated under the off-site waste and recovery operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NESHAP, the EPA evaluated all chemicals or groups of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemicals listed as HAP in CAA section 112(b). Among the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors included in the EPA's evaluation was an assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the aqueous and organic volatility characteristics of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each HAP chemical, the ability of the analytical test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods to quantitate a HAP chemical, and the aqueous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solubility of a HAP chemical. Based on the evaluation, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA selected the specific organic HAP chemicals listed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Table 1 to the proposed rule (to obtain a copy of this table 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the regulatory text of the proposed rule refer to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beginning of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 section of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice). The EPA requests comment on the list of HAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemicals that the Agency is proposing to be regulated under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The list of organic HAP selected for regulation under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP contains 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
many different types of organic chemicals. The EPA decided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to develop a single set of regulatory alternatives for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
off-site waste and recovery operations source category to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control organic HAP emissions as a class as opposed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attempting to develop a series of regulatory alternatives to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control emissions of each individual organic HAP chemicals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the list. Consequently, the control technologies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered for the regulatory alternatives are directed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
towards the control total organic HAP emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is EPA's intent that the NESHAP address waste and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery operations receiving from other facilities those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials that potentially can emit significant quantities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the organic chemicals on the HAP list for the rule. As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
explained in section II.D.2.a of this notice, the EPA has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developed definitions for different types of wastes to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement the Agency's waste management rules promulgated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under authority of RCRA. However, certain wastes and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recoverable materials that have been specifically excluded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the definitions of waste adopted for these RCRA rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may still contain organics listed as HAP under CAA section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
112(b). Consequently, simply adopting the definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
already used by the EPA for wastes under the RCRA rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could allow certain off-site waste and recovery operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that emit organic HAP to remain unregulated. Therefore, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA decided that to fulfill the congressional directives of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CAA section 112, it is necessary to define the types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials to be regulated under this CAA rulemaking in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
broader context than the EPA has historically used for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RCRA rules.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the off-site waste and recovery operations source 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
category, the EPA decided to adapt the definition of ``waste'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted for the benzene waste operations NESHAP (40 CFR 60 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart FF). Based on this definition, the EPA created 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate terms for ``waste'' and ``recoverable materials'' to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used for the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For this rulemaking, the EPA is proposing to define ``waste'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as any material generated from industrial, commercial, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mining, or agricultural operations or from community 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities that is discarded, discharged, or is being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accumulated, stored, or physically, chemically, thermally, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or biologically treated prior to being discarded or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discharged. The EPA is proposing to define ``recoverable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material'' for this rulemaking as any material generated from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industrial, commercial, mining, or agricultural operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or from community activities that is recycled, reprocessed, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reused, or is being accumulated, stored, or physically, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemically, thermally, or biologically treated prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being recycled, reprocessed, or reused. Based on these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definitions, materials affected by this rulemaking include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those materials determined to be hazardous wastes under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RCRA rules, solid wastes that are not hazardous wastes under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RCRA rules, and secondary materials such as used, surplus, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and scrap materials that are either recycled for recovery of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reusable materials or reprocessed for sale as new products.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Subcategorization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subcategorization of a source category is sometimes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate for a rulemaking when industrial segments within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a source category require application of different types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control techniques. In developing today's proposed rule, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the EPA considered subcategorization of the off-site waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and recovery operations source category and decided not to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
propose subcategories for the off-site waste and recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations NESHAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As described in section III.B of this notice, the EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified several different industrial segments to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in the off-site waste and recovery operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source category. Most of these off-site waste and recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations facilities are also hazardous waste TSDF (refer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to section III.C of this notice). However, the quantity and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
type of organic HAP emissions from an off-site waste and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery operations facility are not dependent upon whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a particular facility is subject to RCRA hazardous waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management rules. As previously described, off-site waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and recovery operations facilities can receive materials 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are not hazardous wastes under the RCRA rules but still 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contain organics listed as HAP under CAA section 112(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, common organic HAP control technologies are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to the operations used at all of the off-site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste and recovery operations facility types. There are no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant differences in the organic HAP emissions or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control technologies applicable to controlling these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions from any of the off-site waste and recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations facility types. Thus, based upon these factors, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the EPA concluded that designation of separate subcategories 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the purpose of developing the off-site waste and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery operations NESHAP is not warranted.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purpose of developing regulatory alternatives which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could be effectively compared in developing this rulemaking, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the EPA identified the predominate types of emissions points 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at off-site waste and recovery operations facilities where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organic HAP emissions occur. Five emission point type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classifications were designated as follows: tanks, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containers, land disposal units, process vents, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment leaks.

D. Definition of Source 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To develop a NESHAP, the EPA first defines the source 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
category and determines the types of HAP emitted from this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source category that are to be controlled by establishing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission standards. Within a source category, the EPA must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
next decide which of the sources of HAP emissions (i.e., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission points or groupings of emission points) are most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate for establishing separate emission standards in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the context of the CAA statutory requirements and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry operating practices for the particular source 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
category. The EPA considered three options for defining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``source'' for the off-site waste and recovery operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NESHAP.

<TEXT>
 
<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The first option is to define the source in a very 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
broad context as the entire facility. This option was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rejected by the EPA for the off-site waste and recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations NESHAP because it would be very difficult to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply a single facility-wide emission limitation level for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MACT to all off-site waste and recovery operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities for several reasons. First, the mechanism by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which organic HAP are emitted to the atmosphere and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
types of air emission controls applicable to reducing these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions vary widely for the emission point types 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified for off-site waste and recovery operations. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, covers frequently are installed on tanks to control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
air emissions while work practice programs are used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control air emissions from equipment leaks. Furthermore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not all off-site waste and recovery operations at a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular facility may be subject to this rulemaking. As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously explained, certain types of waste combustion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
units, landfill units, and other operations are being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addressed by separate EPA regulatory actions. Finally, some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste and recovery operations at a particular facility may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be dedicated to managing only wastes or recoverable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials generated on-site and, thus, would not be subject 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A second option is to define the source in a more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
narrow context as the entire operation used to manage a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular waste or recoverable material from the point 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where the material enters the facility through the point 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where the material exits the facility or, if it is a waste, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposed on-site. Under this definition, the source would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consist of a mix of different types of emission points 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representing the sequence of units in which the waste or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recoverable material is stored, conveyed, treated, and, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some cases, disposed. Under this option, a single emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limitation for MACT would be established for the entire 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
group of emission points comprising the management sequence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to handle the waste or recoverable material. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
second option for defining sources under the off-site waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and recovery operations NESHAP was also rejected by the EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as inappropriate. Unlike manufacturing or production 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processes that produce a specific product, the operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to manage a particular type of waste or recoverable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material cannot be readily characterized by one or even 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
several standardized process configurations which are used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
throughout the industrial segment representing the source 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
category. The types, configurations, and sequencing of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
units used for operations handling a particular type of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste or recoverable material are not consistent, but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instead can vary widely from one facility to the next. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the EPA concluded that this option is not an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate approach for defining sources for the off-site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste and recovery operations NESHAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final option considered by the EPA is to further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
narrow the definition of source to the individual emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
points identified for the source category (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
tanks, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containers, land disposal units, process vents, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment leaks). Under this option, an overall emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limitation for MACT would be established for each emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
point type. The EPA believes that this option is the most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate approach for defining sources for the off-site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste and recovery operations NESHAP. This approach defines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the source in terms of common types of units used at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
off-site waste and recovery operations facilities for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handling all types of wastes and recoverable materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, this approach to defining sources is consistent with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other EPA air rules for waste and recovery operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, for the off-site waste and recovery operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NESHAP, the EPA is proposing to define the source to be each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the individual emission point types.

E. Determination of MACT Floor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statutory requirements under CAA section 112 for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination of the MACT floor are explained in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section II.A of this notice. As explained in section III.C 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this notice, the off-site waste and recovery operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source category contains more than 30 existing sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nationwide. Therefore, for the off-site waste and recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations NESHAP, the MACT floor for existing sources is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined the average emission limitation achieved by the best 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performing 12 percent of existing sources. The MACT floor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for new sources is defined by the emission control that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. MACT Floor for Existing Sources
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Existing Tanks. The MACT floor for existing tanks at off-site waste and recovery operations facilities is determined
to be use of covers on tanks managing wastes or recoverable materials with a VOHAP concentration equal to or greater
than 100 ppmw. This floor determination is based on consideration of data for site-specific tank management practices
reported at 540 of the 710 hazardous waste TSDF and existing EPA air emission standards for tanks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA's review of its tank data base for the off-site waste and recovery operations source category indicates that
most tanks (significantly more than 12 percent) managing waste or recoverable materials containing organic HAP
are covered tanks. A small portion of these tanks also are reported to use more effective air emission controls such
as venting the tank to a control device or using a floating roof on the tank. However, the higher level of air emission
control achieved by this segment of tanks does not represent the average of the top 12 percent of tanks listed in the
data base. Thus, the EPA determined that the air emission control technology for the existing tank MACT floor is use
of a cover.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For other source categories, the EPA has established the need to use a cover or other air emission controls on a tank
based on a characteristic parameter of the materials placed in the tank. The EPA believes that using this approach
provides an effective and enforceable means for applying air emission controls to those tanks with the potential
for organic air emissions and not requiring the unnecessary installation of controls on tanks with no or little potential
for organic air emissions. Consequently, to complete the definition of the MACT floor for tanks at off-site waste
and recovery operations facilities, an applicability cutoff provision (referred to hereafter in this notice as
an ``action level'') is needed to distinguish the tanks at off-site waste and recovery operations facilities that
need to use air emission controls.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the need to periodically confirm that a material placed in a tank remains below the action level selected
to determine applicability, the indicator parameter must be in a format that is relatively simple to determine by
an affected facility owner or operator and can be expeditiously checked by EPA or State enforcement personnel. Considering
this requirement, the EPA evaluated possible action level formats and decided that an action level format based on
the volatile organic HAP concentration of the materials as determined using EPA Method 305 is appropriate for identifying
those tanks used for off-site waste and recovery operations that are expected to have little or no potential for organic
HAP emissions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The data available to the EPA at this time for the off-site waste and recovery operations source category are insufficient
to perform a rigorous statistical analysis for the purpose of establishing the minimum VOHAP concentration value
for the wastes or recoverable materials managed in each of the tanks listed in the data base and reported to use air emission
controls. From a qualitative perspective, application of tank air emission controls is not needed when the material
in the tank has little or no potential for organic HAP emissions. In general, these wastes or recoverable materials
can be characterized as materials having low VOHAP concentrations. The EPA considered a range of possible values
to establish the VOHAP concentration limit. Based on consideration of available information regarding the potential
for organic HAP emissions from off-site waste and recovery operations, the EPA concluded that a VOHAP concentration
value of 100 ppmw would best represent the MACT floor for existing tanks required to use air emission controls.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Using a VOHAP concentration value of 100 ppmw also allows owners and operators to use several different methods for
determining the VOHAP concentration of a waste or recoverable material. This is an important factor considering
the diversity of wastes and recoverable materials potentially subject to the off-site waste and recovery operations
NESHAP and the potential interferences of the quantitation limits of certain analytical methods by non-HAP organic
chemicals in the material. Additionally, selection of 100 ppmw would require most existing tanks managing wastes
or recoverable materials having organic HAP emissions to use air emission controls consistent with other EPA regulatory
actions related to off-site waste and recovery operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many waste and recovery operations facilities subject to this regulation will also be subject to other air emission
standards. The EPA is aware that being subject to several standards with differing action levels may create confusion
in the regulated community. To the extent possible within the requirements of the Clean Air Act, the EPA wishes to minimize
discrepancies between the action level in the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP and other emission standards
affecting waste and recovery operations. The EPA therefore requests comment on the 100 ppmw VOHAP concentration
action level, as well as information that can be used to support alternative action levels, such as 500 ppmw. Specifically,
the EPA requests information on action levels for surface impoundments and other land disposal units.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Existing Containers. The MACT floor for existing containers at off-site waste and recovery operations facilities
is determined to be the use of covers on containers managing wastes or recoverable materials with a VOHAP concentration
equal to or greater than 100 ppmw. The number and type of containers used to manage organic HAP containing wastes or
recoverable materials at off-site waste and recovery operations vary from site-to-site. Furthermore, at any off-site
waste and recovery operations facility, the number of drums, roll-off boxes, or other containers at the site can often
fluctuate on a weekly or monthly basis depending on the number and origin of new material shipments received at the
facility during a particular week or month. Thus, no data are available to the EPA which allow a statistical determination
of the type of air emission controls used on the average of the top 12 percent of containers located at off-site waste
and recovery operations facilities or the VOHAP concentration of wastes or recoverable materials handled in containers.
Based on existing RCRA rules for containers handling hazardous waste and observations by EPA representatives during
site visits to facilities that manage wastes in containers, the EPA concluded that the average emission limitation
achieved by the best performing 12 percent of containers used to handle wastes and recoverable materials containing
organic HAP is the level of control achieved by the use of covers. Thus, the EPA determined that the air emission control
technology for existing container MACT floor is the use of a cover.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA selected a VOHAP concentration value of 100 ppmw to be the action level for the MACT floor for existing containers
consistent with the level selected for existing tanks. Containers such as drums, tank trucks, roll-off boxes, and
tank rail cars are a primary means used to ship materials to off-site waste and recovery operations facilities. In
many cases, these materials are temporarily stored at the off-site waste and recovery operations facility directly
in the shipping containers or are transferred to tanks or other management units prior to treatment and disposal,
in the case of wastes, or prior to reprocessing and shipment, in the case of recoverable materials. The most volatile
of the organic HAP in a waste or recoverable material will be emitted soon after being exposed to the atmosphere. If
containers at the off-site waste and recovery operations facility are not controlled to the same level required of
tanks, a significant portion of the organic HAP in the waste or recoverable material will be emitted before the material
is transferred to the controlled tanks or other controlled management units. Consequently, the organic HAP emission
reduction effectiveness of applying air emission controls on downstream tanks and other management units would
be significantly diminished since a significant portion of the organic HAP in the waste or recoverable material had
already escaped to the atmosphere from open containers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
c. Existing Land Disposal Units. The MACT floor for existing land disposal units at off-site waste and recovery operations
facilities is determined to be no disposal of wastes that contain equal to or greater than 100 ppmw VOHAP concentration
in open land disposal units. No data are available to the EPA which allow a statistical determination of the type of
air emission controls used on the top 12 percent of land disposal units located at off-site waste and recovery operations
facilities or the VOHAP concentration of the wastes disposed of in these units. However, since most of the facilities
operating land disposal units included in the off-site waste and recovery operations source category are also hazardous
waste TSDF, many of the land disposal units are subject to treatment standards under the RCRA land disposal restrictions
(LDR) codified in 40 CFR part 268.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The LDR treatment standards require hazardous waste TSDF owners and operators to treat certain types of hazardous
waste to reduce the toxicity or mobility of specific chemicals contained in the waste before the owner or operator
can place the waste in a surface impoundment, land treatment unit, landfill, or wastepile. The treatment standards
of the RCRA LDR are established by requiring treatment below constituent specific concentration limits that vary
by type of hazardous waste or by requiring use of specific treatment processes. Many of the chemicals for which LDR
treatment standards have been established are also listed as HAP. Thus, the EPA determined that the air emission control
technology for the existing land disposal unit MACT floor is treatment of wastes to remove or destroy organic HAP in
the waste prior to placing the waste in the land disposal unit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Treatment of the waste to reduce the organic HAP concentration to a level of 100 ppmw was selected for the MACT floor
for existing land disposal units based on the same reasoning used in determining the MACT floors determined for existing
tanks and containers (i.e., to distinguish those units with little or no potential to emit organic HAP). The degree
of air emission control achieved by placing a waste with a VOHAP concentration above 100 ppmw in tanks and containers
using air emission controls would be lost if these wastes are ultimately allowed to be placed in land disposal units
without first removing or destroying the organic HAP to a level consistent with the level used to apply air emission
controls to tanks and containers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Existing Process Vents. The MACT floor for process vents used on treatment processes subject to the off-site waste
and recovery operations NESHAP is determined to be application of air emission controls on each affected process
used to treat wastes or recoverable materials with a VOHAP concentration equal to or greater than 100 ppmw as determined
at the point where the material enters the facility. All process vents on an affected process are to be connected through
a closed-vent system to a control device with a minimum 95 percent organic HAP emission control efficiency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As previously explained, most facilities in the off-site waste and recovery operations source category are also
hazardous waste TSDF. Distillation, fractionation, thin-film evaporation, solvent extraction, and stripping
processes that are treating hazardous waste at these TSDF are subject to the existing RCRA air emission standards
for process vents under 40 CFR 264 subpart AA and 40 CFR 265 subpart AA (hereafter referred to in this notice as the ``subpart
AA rules''). The EPA concluded that it is not appropriate to directly transfer the air emission control requirements
of the subpart AA rules to the MACT floor for the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP. Instead, this MACT
floor is based on adapting, to the extent applicable and relevant, the air emission control requirements of the subpart
AA rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The subpart AA rules require a TSDF owner or operator to identify all process vents associated with distillation,
fractionation, thin-film evaporation, solvent extraction, and stripping processes that are treating hazardous
waste having an annual average total organic concentration equal to or greater than 10 ppmw (i.e., vents affected
by the subpart AA rules). Total organic emission rates for each affected vent and for the entire facility from all affected
vents must be determined. The total facility process vent emission rate must then be compared to two specified emission
rate limits (3 pounds of total organic emission per hour and 3.1 tons of total organic emission per year) to determine
whether the owner or operator must use additional air emission controls for the affected vents. If the total facility
process vent emission rate exceeds either of the specified emission limits, then the owner or operator is required
to implement control measures that will reduce total facility process vent organic emissions to below both of the
emission limit levels, or to install air emission controls to reduce total facility process vent organic emissions
by at least 95 weight percent.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Adopting a 10 ppmw action level for the process vent MACT floor corresponding to the 10 ppmw total organic concentration
value used for subpart AA rules was considered by the EPA but determined not to be appropriate. The 10 ppmw value used
for the subpart AA rule is not the sole regulatory criterion (i.e., action level) by which the need to apply air emission
controls to affected vents is determined. The need to apply controls under the subpart AA rules is determined by the
total organic emission rates for each affected vent and for the entire facility from all affected vents. The data available
to the EPA at this time for the off-site waste and recovery operations source category are insufficient to correlate
a VOHAP concentration action level value equivalent to the total organic emission rate limits used for the subpart
AA rules. Consequently, the EPA relied on a qualitative assessment to select a VOHAP concentration action level which
would exclude those treatment processes having little or no potential for organic HAP emissions. A VOHAP concentration
action level of 100 ppmw was selected for the MACT floor for existing process vents consistent with the rationale used
to select the action level for tanks, containers, and land disposal units.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. Existing Equipment Leaks. The MACT floor for equipment leaks is determined to be control of emissions from leaks
in ancillary equipment containing or contacting wastes or recoverable materials with total organic HAP concentrations
equal to or greater than 10 percent by implementing leak detection and repair (LDAR) work practices and equipment
modifications. Most off-site waste and recovery operations facilities are also hazardous waste TSDF. Thus, ancillary
equipment operated at these facilities to treat hazardous waste are subject to the existing RCRA organic air emission
standards for TSDF equipment leaks (40 CFR 264 subpart BB and 40 CFR 265 subpart BB). These standards require implementation
of a LDAR program and modifications to certain types of ancillary equipment operated at the facility that handle hazardous
waste having a total organic concentration equal to or greater than 10 percent. The LDAR and equipment requirements
are consistent with existing NSPS process equipment leak standards promulgated by the EPA under CAA section 111 (i.e.,
40 CFR 60 subparts VV, GG, and KK) and for certain NESHAP process equipment leak standards promulgated under CAA section
112 (i.e., 40 CFR 61 subpart V).

2. MACT Floor for New Sources
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The MACT floor for new sources is identical to the MACT floors determined by the EPA for existing sources with the exception
of the MACT floor for new tanks and new containers. For the emission point types other than tanks or containers, the
MACT floor determined for existing sources also represents the emission control that is achieved in practice by the
best controlled similar source.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. New Tanks. The MACT floor for new tanks is determined to be use of a cover vented to a control device that reduces organic
HAP emissions by 95 percent (or equivalent floating roof technology) for those new tanks in which the organic HAP vapor
pressure of the waste in the tank is equal to or greater than 0.1 kPa (approximately 0.07 psi). This is the level of emission
control that is required for new tanks under the Hazardous Organic NESHAP (40 CFR 63 subpart G). The EPA concluded that
these types of emission controls represent the emission control level achieved in practice by the best controlled
sources similar to the types of new tanks anticipated by the EPA to be built at off-site waste and recovery operations
facilities and used for management of wastes or recoverable materials containing organic HAP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. New Containers. The MACT floor for new containers is determined to be the use of covers and submerged loading for
containers in which waste or recoverable material is placed having a VOHAP concentration equal to or greater than
100 ppmw. The EPA's review of its container data base for the off-site waste and recovery operations source category
indicates that some existing TSDF owners and operators (but significantly less than 12 percent) reported using submerged
fill to load material containing organic HAP into containers.

1. Regulatory Alternatives for Existing Sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Different regulatory alternatives for control of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organic HAP emissions from existing sources at off-site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste and recovery operations facilities were defined. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory alternative was defined by combining the MACT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
floor determinations for each of the five emission point 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
types (labeled ``Regulatory Alternative 1''). Four additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory alternatives for the off-site waste and recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations source category were defined which would provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increasingly greater amounts of total organic HAP emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction from the baseline level of organic HAP emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(labeled ``Regulatory Alternative 2'' through ``Regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternative 5''). Additional organic HAP emission control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements were added to the controls defined for Regulatory Alternative 1 in order of increasing emission control
incremental cost effectiveness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Alternative 1 requires application of air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission controls on tanks, containers, and treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processes managing waste or recoverable material with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VOHAP concentration equal to or greater than 100 ppmw as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined at the point of where the material first enters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the facility. For tank and container emission points, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Alternative 1 requires use of a cover on each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit. For process vent emission points, Regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternative 1 requires connecting the process vent to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control device that reduces organic HAP emissions by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
95 percent. For land disposal unit emission points, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Alternative 1 requires treatment of the wastes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to disposal to reduce the waste VOHAP concentration to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less than 100 ppmw. For equipment leak emission points, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Alternative 1 requires for equipment handling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste or recoverable material streams with a total organic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HAP concentration equal to or greater than 10 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation of a leak detection and repair (LDAR) program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and certain equipment modifications. The requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the LDAR program and equipment modifications are consistent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the existing NSPS process equipment leak standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promulgated by the EPA under CAA section 111 (i.e., 40 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
60 subparts VV, GG, and KK) and for certain NESHAP process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment leak standards promulgated under CAA section 112 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i.e., 40 CFR 61 subpart V). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Alternative 2 adds additional control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for containers. The control requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the other emission points remain the same as for Regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternative 1. In addition to using covers on containers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Alternative 2 requires use of submerged fill when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastes or recoverable materials are transferred into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containers by pumping. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Alternative 3 adds additional control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for tanks. The control requirements for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other emission points remain the same as for Regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternative 2. Tanks in which the organic HAP vapor pressure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the waste or recoverable material in the tank is equal to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or greater than 5.2 kPa (approximately 0.75 psi) are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to use a cover and be vented to a control device 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that reduces organic HAP emissions by 95 percent. Tanks in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the organic HAP vapor pressure of the waste or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recoverable material in the tank is less than 5.2 kPa use a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cover without additional controls (i.e., a cover only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without being vented to a control device). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Alternative 4 changes the LDAR program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for the equipment leak emission point category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The control requirements for the other emission points 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remain the same as for Regulatory Alternative 3. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Alternative 4, the LDAR program would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted in accordance with procedures consistent with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hazardous Organic NESHAP (HON) promulgated by the EPA under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR 63 subpart H.

Regulatory Alternative 5 lowers the organic HAP vapor

pressure level for tanks required to be vented to a control

Tanks in which the organic HAP vapor pressure of the waste

2. Regulatory Alternatives for New Sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on current waste management trends, the EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expects very few, if any, new off-site waste and recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations facilities to be built in the foreseeable future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A more likely scenario is construction of new units (such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tanks or treatment units) at existing off-site waste and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery operations facilities to expand facility capacity, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replace existing surface impoundments, or add new treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capability or expand treatment capacity. However, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available information to the EPA is insufficient to make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projections of the numbers or types of new sources to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
built during the next 5 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A regulatory alternative representing the MACT floor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for new sources at off-site waste and recovery operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities was defined by combining the MACT floor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determinations for new sources. No regulatory alternatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beyond the MACT floor were identified for new sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulatory alternative for new sources requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application of air emission controls on tanks, containers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and treatment processes managing waste or recoverable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material with a VOHAP concentration equal to or greater than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
100 ppmw as determined at the point where the material first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enters the facility. For tank emission points, tanks in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the organic HAP vapor pressure of the waste or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recoverable material in the tank is equal to or greater than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
0.7 kPa are required to use a cover and be vented to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control device that reduces organic HAP emissions by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
95 percent (or equivalent floating roof technology). Tanks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in which the organic HAP vapor pressure of the waste or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recoverable material in the tank is less than 0.7 kPa use a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cover without additional controls (i.e., a cover only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without being vented to a control device). For container 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission points, the regulatory alternative requires use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a cover on each unit and use of submerged fill when wastes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or recoverable materials are transferred into containers by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pumping. For process vent emission points, the regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative requires connecting the process vent to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control device that reduces organic HAP emissions by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
95 percent. For land disposal unit emission points, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory alternative requires treatment of the wastes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to disposal to reduce the waste VOHAP concentration to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less than 100 ppmw. For equipment leak emission points, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory alternative requires a implementation of a LDAR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program and certain equipment modifications specified under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the existing for ancillary equipment handling waste or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recoverable material streams with a total organic HAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration equal to or greater than 10 percent. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment leak requirements are consistent with the existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NSPS process equipment leak standards.

G. Regulatory Alternative Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA developed estimates of the impacts associated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with each of the regulatory alternatives for existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources. As explained in the preceding section, no impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were estimated for the regulatory alternatives for new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources because of difficulty in projecting the numbers and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
types of new sources likely to be built over the next 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

1. Overview of Impacts Estimation Methodology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In developing NESHAP and other air standards, the EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequently uses a model plant approach for comparing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative control options. However, for the off-site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste and recovery operations source category, it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difficult to adequately characterize the source category 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using a selection of several representative model plants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because, for many of the facilities in the source category, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the quantities and characteristics of wastes and recoverable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials received at the facility are highly variable and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can change often (as frequently as on a day-to-day basis). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, many different waste management unit and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recoverable material reprocessing unit configurations are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used at off-site waste and recovery operations facilities to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manage these ever changing materials. Consequently, the EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decided a model plant approach is not appropriate for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimating control option impacts for the off-site waste and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery operations source category.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Instead of using a model plant approach for the off-site waste and recovery operations source category, the EPA decided
to adapt a computer model developed by the Agency to estimate nationwide organic air emission impacts from RCRA hazardous
waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSDF). As explained in section III of this notice, the EPA estimates
that approximately 90 percent of the nationwide organic HAP emissions for the off-site waste and recovery operations
source category occur from hazardous waste TSDF. Consequently, the EPA considers adapting this computer model to
be appropriate for evaluating alternative control options for the off-site waste and recovery operations source
category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary sources of site-specific waste data used as input to the computer model are two comprehensive nationwide
surveys that the EPA Office of Solid Waste (OSW) conducted in 1987: the National Survey of Hazardous Waste Generators
(referred to hereafter as the ``GENSUR''); and the National Survey of Hazardous Waste Treatment, Storage, Disposal,
and Recycling Facilities (referred to hereafter as the ``TSDR Survey''). These data represent waste quantities,
waste compositions, and waste management practices at hazardous waste TSDF in 1986, and are the most recent nationwide
TSDF waste data available to the EPA on a consistent, industry-wide basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data base indicates that 710 TSDF received wastes and recoverable materials from off-site waste generators in
1986. The EPA adapted its computer model to simulate the waste management processes reported in the TSDR Survey to
be operating at each of these TSDF. Organic HAP emission factors and emission control cost factors are assigned to
each waste management process using one (or in many cases a combination of several) of the model units developed for
the TSDF RCRA air rule projects. Further details regarding the emission estimation methodology are provided in the
BID for this proposed rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA is aware that some waste management practices have changed since the data were collected for the GENSUR and
TSDR Survey because of new EPA regulations promulgated since 1986 (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the RCRA land disposal restrictions) as well as changes implemented by the waste management industry. To address
these changes in the definition of the baseline used for this rulemaking, assumptions were applied in the computer
model to better reflect current industry-wide waste management trends (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, conversion of surface impoundments to tanks, treatment of certain wastes prior to or as an alternative to land disposal).
Additional assumptions were made to simulate the implementation of the different regulatory alternatives in the
computer model. These assumptions are described in further detail in the BID for this proposed rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

2. Regulatory Baseline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the purpose of evaluating the relative organic emission reduction effectiveness of different regulatory alternatives,
the EPA defines a ``baseline'' as a reference point from which each regulatory alternative can be compared. The baseline
represents the estimated level of organic emissions from the source category that would occur in the absence of implementing
any of the regulatory alternatives. For the off-site waste and recovery operations source category, the EPA chose
a baseline which would reflect the level of organic emissions for each emission point type following implementation
of air emission controls required by federally enforceable air regulations in effective as of July 1991. The EPA defined
the baseline to consist of the following regulations: (1) RCRA organic air emission standards for TSDF process vents
(40 CFR 264 subpart AA and 40 CFR 265 subpart AA); (2) RCRA organic air emission standards for TSDF equipment leaks (40
CFR 264 subpart BB and 40 CFR 265 subpart BB); (3) RCRA land disposal restrictions (40 CFR part 268); and (4) NESHAP for
benzene waste operations (40 CFR 61 subpart FF).

3. Organic Emissions Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA estimated organic HAP emission reductions that would be achieved if air rules based on each of the five regulatory
alternatives were implemented. Baseline organic HAP emissions are estimated to be approximately 52,000 Mg/yr.
The organic HAP emissions assuming implementation of the individual regulatory alternatives are estimated to be
approximately: 28,000 Mg/yr for Regulatory Alternative 1, 23,000 Mg/yr for Regulatory Alternative 2, 9,000 Mg/yr
for Regulatory Alternative 3, 9,000 Mg/yr for Regulatory Alternative 4, and 8,000 Mg/yr for Regulatory Alternative
5.

4. Other Environmental and Energy Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The primary source of other environmental and energy impacts is expected to result from the operation of control devices
used to remove or destroy organics in captured vapor streams. Electric motor-driven fans, blowers, or pumps, depending
on the type of control device, are used for operations such as moving the captured organic vapors to the control device,
circulating cooling water through a condenser, or pumping recovered liquids to an accumulation tank. Generation
of the electricity to operate the control device often requires burning of fuel in an electric utility power plant
which produces air emissions, wastewater discharges, and solid wastes. When carbon adsorption systems are used,
the organic HAP removed from the vapor stream are adsorbed on the activated carbon in the control device. Once the carbon
becomes saturated with organics, it must be regenerated or disposed of in a landfill. Regeneration of the carbon requires
steam. Producing this steam in a boiler creates both secondary air and energy impacts. Disposal of the spent carbon
produces a solid waste impact.

5. Control Cost Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Total capital investment (TCI) cost represents the cost to facility owners and operators to purchase and install
air emission control equipment. The TCI costs in 1991 dollars to implement each of the regulatory alternatives is
estimated to be approximately: $11 million for Regulatory Alternative 1, $14 million for Regulatory Alternative
2, $49 million for Regulatory Alternative 3, $57 million for Regulatory Alternative 4, and $78 million for Regulatory
Alternative 5. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Total annual cost represents the total cost to facility owners and operators each year to: Operate and maintain the
air emission controls required by the proposed rule; perform the inspection, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting
required by the proposed rule; and repay the capital investment for the air emission controls. The capital recovery
was estimated using an interest rate of 7 percent applied over a period ranging from 10 to 20 years depending on the expected
service life for each type of air emission control equipment. The total annual cost to implement each of the regulatory
alternatives is estimated to be approximately: $4.7 million per year for Regulatory Alternative 1, $5.2 million
per year for Regulatory Alternative 2, $24.5 million per year for Regulatory Alternative 3, $26.1 million per year
for Regulatory Alternative 4, and $36.3 million per year for Regulatory Alternative 5.

6. Economic Impact Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA performed an economic impact analysis using a model that simulates 60 separate waste disposal markets and
then estimates facility and market responses to the costs of implementing the requirements of the proposed rule.
All dollar amounts for prices and costs were adjusted to reflect 1991 dollars. The EPA made no projections of new off-site
waste and recovery operations that would be affected by the proposed rule.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Complying with the proposed rule will increase the costs of providing services at off-site waste and recovery operations
facilities. The magnitude of the cost increases would vary from facility to facility depending on factors such as
the types of wastes or recoverable materials received, the types of waste or recovery operations performed, the number
and types of emission points for each of these operations, and the level of emission control already in place at the
facility. Cost increases would lead to some price increases, and possibly reduced profits for some firms in the business.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule is likely to affect prices charged in almost all of the 60 markets studied, although many markets
are likely to experience very small changes or none at all. The most severely affected market (in percentage terms)
may experience a price increase in excess of 70 percent. The greatest absolute increase in price would be an increase
of $500 per Mg of waste, which would be a 30 percent increase. The greatest decrease in quantity would be 375 Mg of waste.
Overall, the quantity of off-site waste managed at the 700-plus facilities in the data base used for the economic impact
analysis would decrease by slightly over 1,600 Mg, or about 0.009 percent of the estimated 19 million Mg of waste managed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA's analysis assumed that owners of affected facilities would respond to this rule by either installing and
operating the required air emission control equipment, discontinuing specific individual waste or recovery operations
affected by the rule, or closing the entire facility. The EPA projects that although 100 individual waste and recovery
operations located at a number of facilities could shut down as a result of this proposed rule, only about 10 entire
facilities would close. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of decisions made by the EPA regarding the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP rulemaking since
the completion of the economic impact analysis change the costs to comply with the rule for some individual waste or
recovery operations at a particular facility from the costs used for the economic impact analysis. The compliance
costs for some of these individual operations would increase while for other individual operations the costs would
decrease depending on site-specific factors. However on a facility-wide basis, the EPA expects that the total cost
to comply with the requirements of the proposed rule for most of individual off-site waste and recovery operations
facilities listed in the data base to be about the same as the total individual facility compliance costs used for the
economic impact analysis described above. Thus, the EPA believes that the results of this analysis are representative
of the overall economic impacts of the proposed rule.

A. Selection of Regulatory Alternative for Existing Sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To select one of the five regulatory alternatives to serve as the basis for the proposed standards for existing sources,
the EPA evaluated the organic HAP emission reductions, control costs, economic impacts, and other environmental
and energy impacts associated with implementing the air emission controls under each regulatory alternative. Based
on this evaluation, the EPA selected Regulatory Alternative 3 as the basis for the standards proposed for existing
sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Alternative 1, the MACT floor, is estimated to reduce nationwide organic HAP emissions by approximately
24,000 Mg/yr. Regulatory Alternative 2 is estimated to reduce nationwide organic HAP emissions by approximately
29,000 Mg/yr. Substantially higher organic HAP emission reductions beyond those estimated for Regulatory Alternatives
1 and 2 are estimated to be achieved by either Regulatory Alternative 3, 4, or 5. All three of these regulatory alternatives
are estimated to achieve similar levels of organic HAP emission reduction from the regulatory baseline. Nationwide
organic HAP emission reductions are estimated to be 43,000 Mg/yr for Regulatory Alternative 3, 43,000 Mg/yr for Regulatory
Alternative 4, and 44,000 Mg/yr for Regulatory Alternative 5. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The highest level of nationwide organic HAP emission reduction would be achieved by selecting either Regulatory
Alternative 3, 4, or 5 as the basis for the standards for existing sources. The estimated control cost estimates for
Regulatory Alternatives 4 and 5 are higher than the estimated costs for Regulatory Alternative 3. Because Regulatory
Alternative 3 would provide essentially the same level of nationwide organic HAP emission reduction for a lower cost,
Regulatory Alternatives 4 and 5 were eliminated from further consideration as the basis for the proposed standards.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA may set standards that are more stringent than the MACT floor if such standards are achievable considering
the cost, environmental, and other impacts listed in CAA section 112(d)(2). Based on the information available to
the EPA at this time, the only difference in these cost, environmental, and other impacts that the EPA can distinguish
between Regulatory Alternatives 1, 2, and 3 is related to the estimated nationwide costs of controls required by each
of these regulatory alternatives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total nationwide annual cost estimated to implement controls under either Regulatory Alternative 1 or 2 is approximately
the same ($4.7 million per year for Regulatory Alternative 1 versus $5.2 million per year for Regulatory Alternative
2). The total nationwide annual cost estimated to implement controls under Regulatory Alternative 3 is significantly
higher ($24.5 million per year). However, given the additional 19,000 Mg/yr of nationwide organic HAP emission reduction
that is estimated to be achieved over Regulatory Alternative 1 and the additional 14,000 Mg/yr of nationwide organic
HAP emission reduction that is estimated to be achieved over Regulatory Alternative 2, the EPA concluded that the
additional cost of implementing controls under Regulatory Alternative 3 is reasonable and justifiable. Thus, the
EPA selected Regulatory Alternative 3 as the basis for the proposed standards for existing sources.

B. Selection of Regulatory Alternative for New Sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No regulatory alternatives beyond the MACT floor were identified for new sources. Thus, the MACT floor for new sources
is the basis for the control requirements proposed for new sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Selection of Format for Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 112 of the CAA requires that emission standards for control of HAP be established unless it is the Administrator's
judgement that emission standards cannot be established or enforced for a particular type of source. Formats for
emission standards include percent reduction, concentration limits, or a mass emission limit. Section 112(h)(2)
identifies two conditions under which it is not feasible to establish an emission standard: (1) If the pollutants
cannot be emitted through a conveyance designed and constructed to emit or capture the pollutant; or (2) if the application
of measurement technology to a particular class of sources is not practicable because of technology and economic
limitations. In these cases, the EPA may instead establish design, equipment, work practice, or operational standards,
or a combination thereof.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NESHAP proposed today for the off-site waste and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery operations source category are a combination of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission standards and equipment, design, work practice, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operational standards. Whenever feasible, emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards have been proposed. However, in some cases, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission limitations would not adequately ensure that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum emission reductions required by the standards are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieved. In those cases, a combination of equipment, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design, work practice, and operational standards have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined by the EPA to be equivalent to the emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards proposed today.

D. Selection of Test Procedures and Compliance Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposed rule, determination of the VOHAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration would not be required for materials placed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
units that use air emission controls in accordance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of the rule. To determine whether a particular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste or recoverable material may be placed in a unit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to the rule but not using the required air emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controls, the owner or operator would be required to conduct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial and periodic determinations of the material VOHAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration. The proposed rule would allow the owner or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator to directly measure the VOHAP concentration by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyzing samples of the material or to use knowledge of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste or recoverable material.

E. Selection of Monitoring and Inspection Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Air Emission Control Equipment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Control devices used to comply with the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent reduction or concentration limit need to be properly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operated and maintained if the standards are to be achieved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on a long term basis. Continuous monitoring of the control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
device operation provides a means to help ensure that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control device remains in compliance with the applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission standard. The EPA considered two monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
options for this NESHAP; (1) the use of continuous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions monitoring (CEM) systems; and (2) the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitors that measure operating parameters which can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directly related to the emission control performance of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular control device. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The organic HAP emissions from off-site waste and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery operations which would be vented to control devices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under this NESHAP typically are not composed of a single or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a few specific organic HAP chemicals. Rather, these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions are more likely to be composed of a mixture of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
many different organic HAP chemicals because of the varying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compositions of the wastes or recoverable materials received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at off-site waste and recovery operations facilities. As a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general rule, CEM systems that uses gas chromatography to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measure individual gaseous organic HAP compound chemicals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are not practical for applications where the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organic HAP chemicals to be monitored exceeds five (see 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed PS 101 and 102, Appendix A of 40 CFR part 64, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 22, 1993 at 58 FR 54648). Therefore for many 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
off-site waste and recovery operations applications, a CEM 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system is not currently commercially available which can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measure total organic HAP for the specific set of organic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HAP chemicals selected for regulation under the off-site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste and recovery operations NESHAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A possible alternative would be to use a CEM system to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measure total VOC or total hydrocarbons (THC) as surrogate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for total organic HAP. However, the EPA concluded that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requiring monitoring based on this alternative is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate for this rulemaking. Current CEM systems that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measure VOC emissions operate by flame ionization detection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(FID), photoionization detection (PID), non-dispersive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
infrared (NDIR) absorption, or other detection principles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that respond to VOC levels. These CEM systems provide a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measure of the relative concentration level of a mixture of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organic chemicals, rather than a quantification of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organic species present (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the total VOC measurement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
device will have a different instrument response for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different organic chemicals). While CEM systems would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide an adequate measure of compliance, monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control device operating parameters (as described below) is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
common practice and provides at least an equivalent measure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of control device performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the reasons explained above, the EPA rejected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requiring the use of CEM systems for the off-site waste and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery operations NESHAP. Instead, the EPA selected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring of control device operating parameters indicative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of air emission control performance as the most appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach to monitoring for the off-site waste and recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations NESHAP source category. However, the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule would not preclude owners or operators choosing to use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a CEM system to comply with the rule's monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for those cases where it is possible to do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed off-site waste and recovery operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NESHAP specifies the types of parameters that can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitored for common types of control devices. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters were selected because they are good indicators of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control device performance and instrumentation is available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at a reasonable cost to monitor these parameters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuously. The proposed rule also would provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions under which an owner or operator could be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved, on a case-by-case basis, to monitor parameters not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically listed in the rule.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposed rule, each individual owner or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator would establish on a site-specific basis minimum or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum operating parameter values, as appropriate for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
type of parameter monitored, that the control device must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not exceed to remain in compliance with the emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards. These site-specific operating parameter values 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could be established through either performance tests, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control device design analysis, or manufacturer's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendations. The established operating parameter values 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for each control device would be incorporated in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operating permit issued for a facility (or, in the absence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of an operating permit, the established levels would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directly enforceable) and would be used to determine a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility's compliance status. Excursions outside the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established operating parameter values would be considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violations of the applicable emission standard except when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the excursion is caused by a startup, shutdown, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
malfunction that meets the criteria specified in the Part 63 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general provisions (40 CFR 63 subpart A). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed NESHAP does not require monitoring of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the following boilers or process heaters when used as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control device to comply with the requirements of the rule: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Boilers and process heaters with a heat capacity equal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to or greater than 44 megawatts (approximately 150 million 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Btu/hr); (2) boilers or process heaters with a heat capacity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less than 44 MW that introduces the vent stream as a primary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel or mixes it with the primary fuel; or (3) boilers or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process heaters with a heat capacity less than 44 MW that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
introduces the vent stream through the same burner. The EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concluded that the specific range of temperatures and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residence times for these types of combustion units which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility operators must continuously maintain to meet their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility process heat or steam demands will ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with the control device standards without the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need for monitoring. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Continuous monitoring is not feasible for those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission points required to comply with certain equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards and work practice standards (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, tanks equipped 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with only covers, pumps and valves subject to LDAR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs). In such cases, failure to install and maintain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the required equipment or properly implement the LDAR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program would constitute a violation of the applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment or work practice standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA request comments on the proposed approach for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination of control device compliance based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuous operating parameter monitoring. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Treatment Processes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposed off-site waste and recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations NESHAP, wastes or recoverable materials having 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VOHAP concentrations of 100 ppmw or more must be treated to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remove or destroy organic HAP in accordance with standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified in the rule before the material can be placed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain management units. Like the control devices used for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organic HAP emission control, the treatment processes used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to comply with these standards (i.e., minimum percent HAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction, VOHAP concentration limits, required HAP mass 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removal levels) need to be properly operated and maintained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if the standards are to be achieved on a long-term basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the EPA is proposing to require monitoring of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operating parameters for the treatment processes used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comply with the rule requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Analogous to the monitoring approach that the EPA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing for control devices, the EPA would prefer that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each owner or operator establish on a site-specific basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum or maximum operating parameter values, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate, for the treatment process that the owner or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator must not exceed to remain in compliance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards. To implement this approach for treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processes, monitoring methods are needed that will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficiently representative, accurate, precise, reliable, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequent, and timely to determine whether a deviation occurs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and therefore to certify whether compliance is continuous or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intermittent. The EPA has identified for some types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment process, such as steam stripping, operating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters that can be continuously monitored and recorded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which directly relate to the treatment process performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA requests comments on establishing monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for treatment processes that can be used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine compliance with the proposed standards based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuous operating parameter monitoring. The EPA further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requests comment on establishing an option within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation for specific default values for treatment process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operating parameters, in the event that owners or operators 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would rather not establish their own minimum or maximum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operating parameter values.

F. Selection of Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under CAA section 114(a), the EPA may require any owner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or operator of a source subject to a NESHAP to establish and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintain records as well as prepare and submit notifications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and reports to the EPA. General recordkeeping and reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for all NESHAP are specified in the Part 63 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general provisions (40 CFR 63.9 and 40 CFR 63.10). All 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recordkeeping and reporting requirements were selected for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with these Part 63 general provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
G. Emissions Averaging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Emissions averaging is an approach used by the EPA for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain other NESHAP rulemakings when the average level of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions from individual facilities in the source category 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remains relatively predictable over extended periods of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time. Application of this approach allows a facility owner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or operator to obtain emission credits by reducing emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from specific emission points at the facility to a level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less than that required by the rule. These emission credits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can then be used to offset emission debits created at those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission points at the facility that are not controlled to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the level required by the rule. Under the EPA's emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
averaging policy, a facility owner or operator must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate that the overall emissions average determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the facility will not result in greater risk or hazard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to human health or the environment than would occur by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complying with the rule requirements at each individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission point. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the development of the proposed rule for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
off-site waste and recovery operations source category, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA considered including an emissions averaging approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the statutory requirements of the CAA do not allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions averaging between different sources. As explained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in section II.D of this notice, the EPA is proposing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source for the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be each emission point type (e.g., each tank, container). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, using a facility-wide emissions averaging approach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i.e., establishing a single average organic HAP emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level for the entire facility) is not appropriate for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, independent of the definition of source 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the EPA selects for this rulemaking, the nature of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
day-to-day operations at off-site waste and recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations facilities complicates and discourages the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application of an emissions averaging approach to this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NESHAP. At an off-site waste and recovery operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility, wastes or recoverable materials are often received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from many different generators. The quantities of materials 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received from these generators can vary from very small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amounts (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, a single 55-gallon drum of a particular waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or recoverable material) to very large amounts (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multiple truck or railcar loads of a single material type). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, the quantities of waste or recoverable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material received as well as the compositions and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations of organic HAP in these materials are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constantly changing over short periods of time (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, daily, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weekly). On a given day an off-site waste and recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations facility can receive wastes or recoverable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials from one group of generators and the next day the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility can receive new wastes or recoverable materials 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from a completely different group of generators. Because of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this operating mode, it is difficult to predict the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantities and organic HAP characteristics of the waste or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recoverable materials that will be received at an off-site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste and recovery operations facility over a future period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of time. Thus, operating the off-site waste and recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations facility so not to exceed a specific overall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average organic HAP emissions level would require the owner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or operator to rigorously monitor and regulate the flow of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastes and recoverable materials into the facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
throughout the entire averaging period used to determine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified average emissions limit. This would require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sampling each load of incoming material, updating the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions averaging calculations, and possibly restricting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantities of waste or recoverable material with certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organic HAP compositions that enter the facility during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remainder of the averaging period to ensure the facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not exceed the specific average organic HAP emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit. The EPA believes this would be a complex and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resource intensive task for off-site waste and recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations facility owners and operators to implement and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for regulatory agency personnel to monitor and enforce. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA decided not to allow emissions averaging in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule for the off-site waste and recovery operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source category because such an approach is not appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for this source category. The EPA requests comments on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
feasibility of applying emissions averaging to the off-site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste and recovery operations source category and requests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information and data that would be necessary to support 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development and implementation of an emissions averaging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach.

A. Effective Date for Compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with CAA section 112(i)(3), owners and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators of existing sources would be required to comply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the requirements of this NESHAP within 3 years after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promulgation of the rule unless a compliance extension is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
granted to a particular source. Owners and operators of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources that begin operation on or after October 13, 1994 would be required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comply with all provisions of the NESHAP upon startup. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

B. Modifications and Reconstruction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Owners and operators of newly constructed or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reconstructed off-site waste and recovery operations must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comply with the requirements specified in the Part 63 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general provisions (40 CFR 63.5). For modified sources, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has proposed guidance under the authority of CAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 112(g) (refer to 59 FR 15504, April 1, 1994). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA anticipates that the final promulgated guidance will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply to off-site waste and recovery operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Relationship to Title V Operating Permit Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under title V of the CAA, the EPA has established a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program the requires all owners and operators of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HAP-emitting sources to obtain an operating permit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(57 FR 32251, July 21, 1992). The EPA's operating permit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program establishes a single document that includes all of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the requirements which pertain to a single source. Each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit will contain federally enforceable conditions with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the source owner and operator must comply. Under this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program, all applicable requirements of the off-site waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and recovery operations NESHAP would ultimately be included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a source's title V operating permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State operating permit programs must be approved by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA. Once a State's permit program has been approved, each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
off-site waste and recovery operations facility within that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State must apply for and obtain an operating permit. If the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State where the facility is located does not have an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved permitting program, the owner or operator of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility must submit the application to the EPA Regional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
office in accordance with the requirements of the Part 63 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general provisions (40 CFR 63 subpart A).

C. Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposes procedural requirements on the development of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant regulatory actions. The EPA must therefore 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine whether a regulatory action is significant. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Order defines a significant regulatory action as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$100 million or more, or adversely affect in a material way 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, users 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fees, or loan programs, or the rights and obligations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipients thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Order.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order 12866, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has been determined that this action will be treated as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``significant regulatory action'' within the meaning of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Order. As such, this action was submitted to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review. Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documented in the docket pertaining to the off-site waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

D. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.) requires Federal agencies to give 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
special consideration to the impacts of regulations on small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities, which are small businesses, small organizations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and small governments. The major purpose of the Regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Flexibility Act is to keep paperwork and regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements from being out of proportion to the scale of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the entities being regulated, without compromising the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
objectives of, in this case, the Clean Air Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A small business with establishments in Standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industrial Classification 4953, Refuse Systems, is defined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the Small Business Administration as one receiving less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than $6 million per year, averaged over the most recent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three fiscal years. A small organization is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not-for-profit enterprise that is independently owned and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operated and is not dominant in the waste disposal industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A small government is one that serves a population of less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 50,000 people. The EPA may use other definitions, but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elects to use these. The EPA believes that small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organizations and small governments have at most a very 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minor involvement with the types of off-site waste and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery operations subject to this rulemaking, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore would not be significantly affected by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP. Hence, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has concentrated its attention on small businesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act specifies that Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies must prepare an initial regulatory flexibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis if a proposed regulatory action would have a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities. The data bases available to the EPA reflect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
state of the hazardous waste TSDF industry in 1986, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide limited basis for updating the economic factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the EPA does not have reliable projections of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
construction of new facilities with off-site waste and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery operations that would be subject to the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule. The EPA therefore assumes the proposed rule may have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a significant impact on a substantial number of small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
businesses, and has conducted a regulatory flexibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis. This analysis is part of the economic impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis (titled Economic Impact Analysis of Proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Off-Site Waste and Recovery Operations) prepared for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking and available in the docket (Docket No. A&hyph;92&hyph;16). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even though many off-site waste and recovery operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities are expected to be area sources and would not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to the proposed NESHAP, the EPA assumed for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory flexibility analysis that all facilities listed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the data base are colocated at major sources. Also, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis did not exclude those off-site waste and recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations facilities that would not be subject to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NESHAP under the proposed applicability exemption for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities at which the total annual organic HAP mass 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
content of all wastes and recoverable materials subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the rule entering the facility is less than 1 Mg/yr. From 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its data base, the EPA has identified 110 small businesses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that own 112 affected facilities. About 90 of these small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
businesses would incur compliance costs associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using air emission control equipment. For about one-third 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the 90 businesses, the annual compliance costs would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceed 5 percent of normal production or waste treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs. For the median small business, the same costs come 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to less than 0.4 percent of sales `` compared with about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
0.01 percent for the median large business. Excluding the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs of monitoring and recordkeeping costs, the capital 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs would exceed the retained earnings breakpoints (the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum amount of new capital a business can raise without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issuing new stock and without changing its existing capital 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
structure) of about 40 percent of the 90 small businesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only about 30 percent of large businesses would have capital 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs of compliance exceeding their breakpoints. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the EPA evaluated the possibility that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule might cause a small business to close. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the rule may cause specific waste treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processes to be shut down at many off-site waste and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery operations facilities, only about 10 facilities are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projected to close outright. Of these, the EPA can single 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
out only three small businesses, each of which has only one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility. Limiting the analysis, to the extent possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the information available in the data base, to only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those facilities which are major sources and would not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualify for the 1 Mg of HAP applicability exemption does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change this number of potential closures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Flexibility Act, the Administrator certifies that this rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may have a significant economic impact on a substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of small entities.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Region V announces its intent to delete the Olmsted County
Landfill Site from the National Priorities List (NPL) and requests public comment on this action. The NPL constitutes
appendix B of 40 CFR part 300 which is the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Contingency Plan (NCP), which USEPA
promulgated pursuant to section 105 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability
Act of 1980 (CERCLA) as amended. This action is being taken by USEPA, because it has been determined that all Fund-financed
responses under CERCLA have been implemented and USEPA, in consultation with the State of Minnesota, has determined
that no further response is appropriate. Moreover, USEPA and the State have determined that remedial activities
conducted at the Site to date have been protective of public health, welfare, and the environment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region V announces its intent to delete the Olmsted County Sanitary Landfill
Site from the National Priorities List (NPL), which constitutes appendix B of the National Oil and Hazardous Substances
Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP), and requests comments on the deletion. The EPA identifies Sites that appear to
present a significant risk to public health, welfare or the environment, and maintains the NPL as the list of those
Sites. Sites on the NPL may be the subject of remedial actions financed by the Hazardous Substance Superfund Response
Trust Fund (Fund). Pursuant to &sect;300.425(e)(3) of the NCP, any site deleted from the NPL remains eligible for
Fund-financed remedial actions if the conditions at the site warrant such action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The USEPA will accept comments on this proposal for thirty (30) days after publication of this document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section II of this document explains the criteria for deleting sites from the NPL. Section III discusses procedures
that EPA is using for this action. Section IV discusses the history of this site and explains how the site meets the deletion
criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deletion of sites from the NPL does not itself create, alter, or revoke any individual's rights or obligations. Furthermore,
deletion from the NPL does not in any way alter USEPA's right to take enforcement actions, as appropriate. The NPL is
designed primarily for informational purposes and to assist in Agency management.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. NPL Deletion Criteria
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NCP establishes the criteria the Agency uses to delete Sites from the NPL. In accordance with 40 CFR 300.425(e),
sites may be deleted from the NPL where no further response is appropriate. In making this determination, USEPA will
consider, in consultation with the State, whether any of the following criteria have been met:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) Responsible parties or other persons have implemented all appropriate response actions required; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) All appropriate Fund-financed responses under CERCLA have been implemented, and no further response action
by responsible parties is appropriate; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (iii) The Remedial investigation has shown that the release poses no significant threat to public health or the environment
and, therefore, remedial measures are not appropriate.

III. Deletion Procedures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Upon determination that at least one of the criteria described in &sect;300.425(e) has been met, USEPA may formally
begin deletion procedures once the State has concurred with the intent to delete. This 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 document, and a concurrent notice in the local newspaper in the vicinity of the Site, announce the initiation of a 30-day
comment period. The public is asked to comment on USEPA's intention to delete the site from the NPL. All critical documents
needed to evaluate USEPA's decision are generally included in the information repository and the deletion docket.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon completion of the public comment period, if necessary, the USEPA Regional Office will prepare a Responsiveness
Summary to evaluate and address comments that were received. The public is welcome to contact the USEPA Region V Office
to obtain a copy of this responsiveness summary, if one is prepared. If USEPA then determines the deletion from the
NPL is appropriate, final notice of deletion will be published in the

IV. Basis for Intended Site Deletion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Olmsted County Landfill is located in the Oronoco Township just east of State Highway 52 about three miles north
of Rochester's city limits. The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency issued the landfill's operating permit to the
City of Rochester in 1970, and amended it in 1972, 1979 and 1984. In late 1982 the city transferred ownership of the landfill
to Olmsted County. The facility's permitted boundary encompasses 304 acres. The county stopped sending municipal
wastes to the landfill in 1987, but one cell continued to be used for demolition debris and coal ash from Rochester Public
Utilities until March 1993. The county has now officially ceased using the landfill. It has been permanently covered,
and the landfill was certified closed by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency in December 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Beginning in 1983, monitoring wells on the Site showed groundwater beneath the landfill was being contaminated with
volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are typically found at landfills. The landfill was added to the Permanent
List of Priorities (the Minnesota Superfund list) in 1984, and in 1986 the USEPA placed it on the National Priorities
List (Federal Superfund list), 51 FR 21054&hyph;21112. Under a cooperative agreement with the USEPA, the MPCA assumed
management of Superfund activities at the Site. The MPCA issued a Request for Response Action in 1989 directing the
city and the county to investigate the nature and extent of the contamination. Olmsted County has taken the lead in
funding and conducting the investigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Remedial Investigation (RI) of the Olmsted County Landfill Site included an ongoing dye-trace study to determine
the direction and rate of groundwater flow in the vicinity of the landfill. Ambient air and landfill gas samples were
characterized, along with ground- and surface-water samples.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Numerous field investigations were conducted over a 13-month period. The RI was completed in July 1992. The supplemental
RI, which was completed in September 1993, was conducted in order to further investigate gas emissions at the site.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the findings in the Remedial Investigation and the Supplemental Remedial Investigation, further response
under CERCLA is not necessary. The low potential for Site impacts will be adequately addressed under the Minnesota
Solid Waste Rules for landfills. The continued monitoring, long-term care and contingency actions are specified
in a Closure Order and Post Closure Care Plan issued to the County on March 22, 1994, by the MPCA. Continued monitoring
to insure compliance with Minnesota Solid Waste Rules will adequately protect human health and the environment.
Annual reviews of the data collected are a current requirement under the Rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On June 21, 1994, a Record of Decision was signed that concludes no remedial action under CERCLA is necessary at the
Site. The selected no-action remedial alternative was chosen in accordance with CERCLA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA, with concurrence of the State of Minnesota, has determined that all appropriate Fund-financed responses under
CERCLA at the Olmsted County Landfill site have been completed, and no further Superfund response is appropriate
in order to provide protection of human health and the environment.

This further notice of proposed rulemaking is one segment of the Fifth Order on Reconsideration and Further Notice
of Proposed Rulemaking in this proceeding. The final rules adopted in this decision may be found elsewhere in this
issue. In the Further Notice Proposed Rulemaking, the Commission sought comment on possible alternative definitions
for small cable operators, independent small cable systems, and small cable systems owned by small multiple system
operators. The Commission also sought comment on whether to retain current definitions or use different definitions
for purposes of establishing special rate or administrative treatment for small operators and small multiple system
operators. The Commission specifically seeks comment on these issues in light of Section 3(a) of the Small Business
Act, and on whether the Commission should employ the current Small Business Administration definition of a small
cable company in the cable rules. A change in the definitions of these categories of cable operators may affect eligibility
under any final rules which the Commission may adopt pertaining to small cable systems.

Background

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1992, Congress amended &sect;3(a) of the Small Business Act to require federal agencies to use small business definitions
created by the Small Business Administration (``SBA''), or in the alternative, seek public comment on different
definitions and obtain the approval of the Small Business Administrator with regard to any regulation applicable
to small businesses, unless other statutory definitions are applicable. SBA rules currently define a small cable
company as one with $11 million or less in gross revenues. The Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition
Act of 1992 defined a small cable system as one with 1,000 or fewer subscribers. A small cable operator is defined as
one with 15,000 or fewer subscribers that is not affiliated with a larger operator. In addition, a small multiple system
operator (``MSO'') is one serving 250,000 or fewer total subscribers that owns only systems with less than 10,000
subscribers each and has an average system size of 1,000 or fewer subscribers. In this rulemaking, the SBA's Office
of Advocacy and the Small Cable Business Association have expressed concern about the Commission's definitions
of small operators eligible for transition relief and our definition of small MSOs. Specifically, the SBA's Office
of Advocacy and the Small Cable Business Association believe the current definitions in our rules defining eligibility
for transition and administrative relief are under inclusive and were promulgated in violation of &sect;3(a) of
the Small Business Act. They urge us to re-evaluate the definitions and seek public input before deciding on permanent
standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Chief Counsel of the SBA's Office of Advocacy has urged the Commission to explore a full range of burden-reducing
regulatory options in our rate proceedings. We are in full agreement with that suggestion. Based on the existing record,
however, we are not persuaded that the actions taken to date to ease the regulatory difficulties faced by smaller operators
have been undertaken in violation of the law. Specifically, the Commission does not believe that Small Business Administration
size standards, to which federal agencies may be required to adhere under Section 3 of the Small Business Act, are applicable
to the Commission's definitions of small cable operators and small cable systems developed in the Second Order on
Reconsideration, Fourth Report and Order, and Fifth Notice of Proposed Rulemaking MM Docket No. 92&hyph;266. For
example, Section 3(a) of the Small Business Act provides that SBA size standards apply for the purposes of all legislation,
unless the legislation specifically authorizes different size standards. The Cable Television Consumer Protection
and Competition Act of 1992 (``1992 Cable Act'') in fact contains a size definition of a small system as one with 1,000
or fewer subscribers. See 47 U.S.C. &sect;543(i). Specifically, the statute requires the Commission to develop
cable rate regulations that reduce cost and administrative burdens for such ``small systems.'' Given the statute's
small system definition of 1,000 or fewer subscribers, Section 3(a) of the Small Business Act is inapplicable. The
Commission has implemented the statutory provision regarding small system relief in a more flexible manner than
is explicitly mandated by the 1992 Cable Act and is now considering further flexibility through extending relief
to additional systems. But this does not alter the fact that the Commission is implementing a statute with an explicit
small business standard. Additionally, the Small Business Act defines small-business concerns as one ``which is
not dominant in its field of operation.'' 15 U.S.C. &sect;632(a)(1). Cable systems subject to rate regulation, regardless
of whether they are large or small, are by definition dominant in their field of operation because they do not face effective
competition. Thus, Section 3(a) of the Small Business Act also does not apply because regulated cable systems do not
meet the definition of a small business concern.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We established transition treatment for small operators pending completion of our cost studies, and have established
administrative relief for independent small systems and small systems owned by small multiple system operators
(``MSOs''). Under our interim cost-of-service rules, independent small systems and small systems owned by small
MSOs also may use special forms for cost-of-service showings. When cost studies are completed, we may make permanent,
eliminate, or modify our transition rate treatment of small operators. When we develop average equipment cost schedules,
we may terminate or modify our provisions for streamlined rate reductions for independent small systems and small
systems owned by small MSOs. In our final cost proceeding, we may modify our requirements for cost showings by independent
small systems and small systems owned by small MSOs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe that it would establish a more complete record for purposes of promulgating final rate rules applicable
to small operators, independent small systems, and small systems owned by small MSOs if we obtain comment on possible
alternative definitions that we could use for purposes of determining eligibility for special rate or administrative
treatment provisions that could apply to small businesses. We are initiating the instant Further Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking for purposes of obtaining this comment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, we solicit comment on whether we should retain current definitions or use different definitions for
purposes of establishing special rate or administrative treatment for small operators and small MSOs that could
be small businesses. We specifically seek comment on these issues in light of Section 3(a) of the Small Business Act,
and on whether we should employ the current SBA definition of a small cable company in our cable rules.

Pursuant to Section 603 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Commission has prepared the following initial regulatory
flexibility analysis (IRFA) of the expected impact of these proposed policies and rules on small entities. Written
public comments are requested on the IRFA. These comments must be filed in accordance with the same filing deadlines
as comments on the rest of the Notice, but they must have a separate and distinct heading designating them as responses
to the regulatory flexibility analysis. The Secretary shall cause a copy of the Notice, including the initial regulatory
flexibility analysis, to be sent to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration in accordance
with Section 603(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Pub. L. No. 96&hyph;354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. Section 601

Reason for action. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 requires the Commission to prescribe rules
and regulations for determining reasonable rates for basic tier cable service and to establish criteria for identifying
unreasonable rates for cable programming services. The Commission has adopted rate regulations that require a comparison
to the rates of cable systems subject to effective competition, as defined in the Cable Act of 1992 and represented
in the revised benchmark formula. This Notice proposes to review and determine appropriate definitions of small
systems, small operators, and small MSOs for the purpose of determining rate regulation applicable to these categories
of companies.

This is a revision of the NASA FAR Supplement (NFS), to allow the Contracting Officer to direct the Contractor to establish
claim to copyright in computer software and assign the copyright to the Government or another party. Assignment to
the Government can only be directed when the Contractor has not previously been granted permission to establish copyright
on its own behalf. This is needed because existing contract clauses do not provide this authority for some types of
contracts.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
FAR clause 52.227&hyph;14, Rights in Data_General, as modified by the NASA FAR Supplement (NFS), currently allows
contractors to establish copyright in software developed under the contract. The clause also currently requires
contractors to obtain the Contracting Officer's permission prior to exercising this right. This revision will not
restrict this right. However, if a contractor is not interested in obtaining copyright, or developing the software,
and is unwilling to assign the copyright to NASA or its designee, no copyright can be claimed for the software. In many,
if not most, cases this does not matter. However, in some situations where further development of software is needed
before the software can be marketed, the U.S. private sector may be unwilling to invest in developing and marketing
the software without the availability of copyright protection. This revision will provide authority to acquire
assignments of copyright in such situations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is NASA's intent to announce to the public the availability of licensable software and the criteria which will be
utilized in selecting licensees. Exclusive and partially exclusive licenses will be granted only after public notice
and opportunity to file written objections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAR 27.404(g)(3) authorizes agencies to include contractual requirements to assign copyright to the Government
or another party. The FAR further directs that any such requirements established by agencies should be added to clause
52.227&hyph;14, Right in Data_General. This authority is the same as is presently contained in FAR clause 52.227&hyph;17,
Rights in Data_Special Works. That clause is specifically tailored for acquisitions where data is the main deliverable;
it lacks many elements necessary in contracts involving a mix of deliverables. The proposed revision will result
in a clause that more appropriately addresses NASA's needs in acquisitions involving mixed deliverables. Further,
with the increased emphasis in recent years on promoting U.S. competitiveness and the commercialization of Government-generated
technology, it is important that we take steps to protect computer software that has a significant technology transfer
value. The availability of copyright protection will enable NASA to enhance U.S. competitiveness and more effectively
transfer valuable computer software technology.

The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has determined that this rule is significant under E.O. 12866. This
regulation is needed on an urgent and compelling basis because valuable computer software developed under NASA contracts
may become part of the public domain, and thereby lose its value, if the software is not copyrighted. Current regulations
grant the contractor the right to request permission to establish copyright, but there is no procedure to force the
contractor to exercise that right or to transfer the copyright to the Government. The regulation meets the need, i.e.,
provides protection for the software's value, by allowing NASA to direct the contractor to establish copyright and
assign the copyright to NASA or another party. The potential costs for this regulatory action are limited to the nominal
costs involved in establishing and transferring copyright. These costs may vary, but are estimated to be less than
$100 per copyright, and it is anticipated that less than 10 contractors annually would each be required to incur this
expense one time. Because the contracts under which valuable software is likely to be developed are usually cost-reimbursable
research and development contracts, the costs for copyright and transfer would normally be charged to the Government.
The potential benefits are the value of the protected software; this value cannot be measured, as it depends on future
discoveries and developments. This value cannot be considered to be taken away from contractors, because it never
belonged to them.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary proposes to amend the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program regulations. The FFEL Program consists
of the Federal Stafford, Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS), Federal PLUS, and the Federal Consolidation
Loan Programs. These amendments are needed to implement certain changes made to the Higher Education Act of 1965,
as amended (HEA), by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, enacted August 10, 1993, and by the Higher Education
Technical Amendments of 1993, enacted December 20, 1993. The proposed regulations would also amend the FFEL Program
regulations to permit a lender to issue a ``master check'' to an institution for purposes of disbursing Federal Stafford
loan proceeds to an institution, to prohibit a subsequent holder of a loan to bill the Secretary for any applicable
interest benefits or special allowance on a loan for which origination fees have not been paid, and to limit the collection
charges that may be assessed a borrower with a defaulted loan that is paid off through loan consolidation. The proposed
regulations would implement section 428(n) of the HEA as amended by OBRA which requires a State to share the costs of
defaulted Federal Stafford and Federal SLS loans with the Federal government.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FFEL Program regulations (34 CFR Part 682) govern the Federal Stafford Loan Program, the Federal SLS Program,
the Federal PLUS Program, and the Federal Consolidation Loan Program (formerly the Guaranteed Student Loan programs).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary is proposing to revise 34 CFR Part 682 to implement changes made to the HEA by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1993 (OBRA) (Pub. L. 103&hyph;66) and the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1993 (the Technical Amendments)(Pub.
L. 103&hyph;208). OBRA added section 428(n) to the HEA to require a State to pay a fee to the Secretary based on the State's
new FFEL loan volume and the dollars associated with the most recent cohort default rates calculated for schools in
that State. This provision is intended to encourage a State to ensure that its educational institutions provide quality
services to their students. A State may achieve this objective through licensing and State Postsecondary Review
Entities. This provision is also intended to partially offset the cost to the Federal government of paying student
loan default claims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These proposed regulations would also amend the FFEL Program regulations to reflect certain other changes made to
the HEA by OBRA. The Secretary proposes to amend the regulations to reflect statutory provisions providing for the
payment of lender referral fees to guaranty agencies, the reduction of the reinsurance coverage and reinsurance
rates for a guaranty agency's losses on default claims and the reduction of insurance coverage a guaranty agency may
pay on default claims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These proposed regulations would also amend the FFEL Program regulations to reflect certain changes to the HEA by
the Technical Amendments. These changes require a lender to rebate excess interest on certain Federal Stafford loans
to either the borrower or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary and require lenders to convert the interest rates on certain Federal Stafford loans to a variable interest
rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These proposed regulations would also amend the FFEL Program regulations to permit a lender to disburse Federal Stafford
loan proceeds to a school via a master check. This change is needed to facilitate a lender's ability to disburse Federal
Stafford loans. These proposed regulations would also prohibit a subsequent holder of a loan to bill the Secretary
for any applicable interest benefits or special allowance on a loan for which origination fees have not been paid.
This change is needed to ensure that origination fees are paid on a loan if the loan is sold by considering the loan ineligible
for reinsurance if such fees are not paid. These proposed regulations would also limit the collection charges that
may be assessed a borrower with a defaulted loan that is paid off through loan consolidation. This change will encourage
a borrower to get his or her loan out of default for purposes of Title IV eligibility by having it paid off through consolidation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations would delete current &sect;682.407_Administrative Cost Allowance for Guaranty Agencies.
This section is no longer needed because OBRA removed the Secretary's authority for paying an administrative cost
allowance to a guaranty agency from the HEA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations would implement the requirements of section 427A(i) of the HEA as amended by the Technical
Amendments. The changes in this section reflect the new statutory language that requires lenders to return excess
interest to certain Stafford loan borrowers or the Secretary and requires the conversion of the interest rate on certain
Federal Stafford loans to a variable interest rate.

Section 682.207&blank;Due diligence in disbursing a loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations would extend a provision of the FFEL Program regulations that were published on June 28,
1994 (59 FR 33334) that permitted the use of a master check for purposes of disbursing PLUS loans to the Federal Stafford
loan programs. This proposed rule would allow a lender to use a master check to disburse Federal Stafford loans, thereby
facilitating their disbursement. A ``master check'' is a check representing the disbursement of loan proceeds for
more than one borrower. If a master check is used, the lender must provide the school with a list of the borrower's names,
social security numbers, and the loan amounts disbursed through the master check. The proposed regulations would
also require a lender to provide a school with a list of the borrowers' names, social security numbers, and the loan
amounts if the loans are disbursed by electronic funds transfer.

Section 682.305&blank;Procedures for payment of interest benefits and special allowance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations would amend the FFEL Program regulations to require an originating lender to pay origination
fees to the Secretary. In many cases, the Secretary is not recovering the origination fees from the originating lender
or any subsequent holder of a loan when the loan is sold. A June 1994 report conducted by the General Accounting Office
and the Office of the Inspector General (GAO/AIMD&hyph;94&hyph;131 and ACN 17&hyph;30302) has identified this
as a potentially serious area of abuse that may be costing the Department a significant amount of money. The Secretary
has decided that regulatory controls are needed to help reduce the incidence of abuse in this area. Therefore, in addition
to the proposed rule that would require the originating lender to pay origination fees, the proposed regulations
would also prevent a subsequent holder of a loan for which the origination fees were not paid from receiving any interest
benefits or special allowance on that loan, or a guaranty agency from receiving reinsurance payments from the Secretary
on that loan, until the origination fees have been paid.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations are needed to implement section 428(e) of the HEA. Under this section, the Secretary will
pay a lender referral fee to each guaranty agency with whom the Secretary has a lender referral agreement in an amount
equal to 0.5 percent of the principal amount of a loan made as a result of the agency's referral services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations would also change the regulations to reflect a change made by OBRA to section 428(b)(1)(G)
of the HEA that limits a guaranty agency to paying 98 percent of the unpaid principal balance of each loan on default
claims on loans disbursed on or after October 1, 1993.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations would add a new paragraph to the regulations that would limit the amount of collection charges
and late fees a guaranty agency may guarantee when a defaulted loan is consolidated. Under the proposed regulations,
a guaranty agency may not guarantee a consolidation loan that includes a defaulted loan if the collection fees and
late charges assessed the borrower on the defaulted loan being consolidated exceeds 18.5 percent of the outstanding
principal and interest on the defaulted loan at the time the pay-off amount of the loan is certified to the consolidating
lender. The Secretary is proposing this provision to limit the amount of collection fees and late charges that a borrower
may be liable for on a defaulted FFEL Program loan if such loan is consolidated. Because collection charges and late
fees may be as high as 42 percent of the outstanding principal and interest of a defaulted loan, the Secretary is proposing
this limitation to encourage a borrower to pay off a defaulted loan through loan consolidation and bring the loan out
of default for purposes of title IV eligibility.

The proposed regulations would amend this section of the regulations to reflect a change made by OBRA to section 428(c)(1)
of the HEA that reduces the percentages the Secretary will reinsure on a guaranty agency's default claims on loans
made on or after October 1, 1993 from 100, 90, and 80 percent to 98, 88, and 78 percent, respectively, with two exceptions.
First, the Secretary will reinsure loans at 100, 90, or 80 percent that are transferred from an insolvent guaranty
agency or from an agency that withdraws its participation in the FFEL Program, under a plan approved by the Secretary.
Second, the Secretary will provide 100 percent reinsurance for loans made under an approved lender-of-last-resort
program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule would add a new &sect;682.418 to the FFEL Program regulations to implement a change made by OBRA
to section 428(n) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA). This provision requires a State to pay a fee to the Secretary
if a school located in that State has a cohort default rate that exceeds 20 percent. The purpose of this fee is to partially
offset the cost to the Federal government of paying default claims on FFEL Program loans by requiring a State to share
the cost of defaults by student borrowers attending schools in the State. A State will be required to pay the fee to the
Secretary within 60 days after the date it is notified by the Secretary of the fee it must pay. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 428(n) mandates a formula for the Secretary to use to determine the amount of the State's fee. The State's fee
is calculated by multiplying the State's new loan volume for FFEL Program loans for all schools in the State for the
current fiscal year by 12.5 percent, and multiplying that result by the sum of the amounts calculated as explained
in the following paragraph for each school in the State with a cohort default rate that exceeds 20 percent. That result
is then divided by the amount of loan volume attributable to current and former students of schools in that State who
entered repayment during the fiscal year used in calculating the cohort default rates. Under section 428(n), the
amount by which the State's new loan volume is multiplied increases from 12.5 percent to 20 percent in fiscal year 1996
and to 50 percent in fiscal year 1997 and succeeding fiscal years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amount by which a school exceeds the 20 percent default standard for this calculation is the amount of loan volume
in default for the cohort default rate for the school minus 20 percent of the loans attributable to current and former
students of the school who entered repayment during the fiscal year used in calculating the cohort default rate.

The Secretary is considering the following approaches to implement the formula and is interested in public comment
as to which approach would best implement the statute. The language in the statute indicates that the fee structure
should be calculated using the new loan volume attributable to all institutions in the State for the current fiscal
year. However, the Secretary will not know the final new loan volume data for a fiscal year until after the fiscal year
has ended. The Secretary has identified the following two options to implement the statute: (1) to use the new loan
volume for the fiscal year that precedes the fiscal year in which the fee is determined; or (2) to estimate the new loan
volume for the fiscal year during which the State is assessed a fee. Also, because the time of the year the Secretary
will be determining the fee coincides with the time of the year cohort default rates are generally determined, the
Secretary may be presented with the opportunity to use either the cohort default rates that are currently being issued,
or the rates that were issued the previous year. Schools would have had the chance to appeal the rates that were issued
in the previous year based on inaccurate data, while the newer rates will more likely reflect the school's current
situation. The Secretary is interested in comments regarding which rate should be used if this situation arises.

The following example illustrates the application of the statutory formula and the resulting fee a State would be
required to pay. If the new loan volume for a State is $100 million and $40 million of Stafford and SLS loans entered repayment
during the fiscal year used for the relevant cohort default rates, and the dollars associated with the default rates
of the schools in the State with cohort default rates above 20 percent is $10 million entering repayment and $4 million
entering default, the State would pay $625,000 as a default offset fee for fiscal year 1995.

A State may charge a fee to schools located in the State that participate in the FFEL Program to defray the fee assessed
the State by the Secretary. As required by the statute, the State's fee structure must be approved by the Secretary
and be based on the relationship of the school's cohort default rate to the default fee assessed the State by the Secretary.
A State may not develop its fee structure so that a school is assessed a fee by a State that is greater than that school's
contribution to the fee the State is required to pay the Secretary. The State's school fee payment structure must also
include a procedure by which a school with a high cohort default rate may be exempted from payment of the fee if the school
can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the State that exceptional mitigating circumstances contributed to its cohort
default rate. A State must provide a school a reasonable amount of time from the date it notifies the school that it is
being assessed a fee under this provision to either pay the fee or submit an appeal, with appropriate documentation
that demonstrates that exceptional mitigating circumstances contributed to its cohort default rate. The Secretary
is particularly interested in knowing if the public believes it would be appropriate for the Secretary to provide
regulatory guidance with respect to the exceptional mitigating circumstances a State may select. The Secretary
also is interested in knowing if the public believes the following criteria would assist the States in developing
their exceptional mitigating circumstances: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The completion and job placement rates of Stafford and SLS loan borrowers at the school whose loans entered repayment
during the fiscal year used for calculating the school's cohort default rate; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The regional or State unemployment rates during the fiscal year used for calculating the school's cohort default
rate and during the subsequent fiscal year; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The income level of former Stafford and SLS loan borrowers at the school whose loans entered repayment during the
fiscal year used for calculating the school's cohort default rate and during subsequent fiscal year; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The exceptional mitigating circumstances criteria currently reflected in 34 CFR 668.17(d)(ii) under which
a school may appeal its loss of eligibility to participate in the FFEL Program; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The school's status as a Historically Black College and University, a Tribally Controlled Community College
under section 2(a)(4) of the Tribally Controlled Community College Assistance Act of 1978, and a Navajo Community
College under the Navajo Community College Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary is particularly interested in receiving public comment on these criteria as well as other criteria
the public believes may assist a State in developing its exceptional mitigating circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A State may not attempt to collect a fee from a school under these regulations during the school's appeal of the fee to
the State or if the school satisfactorily demonstrates to the State that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceptional mitigating circumstances contributed to its cohort default rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary is interested to know if the public believes that the State should be responsible in whole, or in part,
for the portion of the State's fee that is attributed to: (1) the fees that are attributed to a school that has closed
or no longer participates in the FFEL Program; (2) the fees attributed to schools that meet the exceptional mitigating
circumstances standards established by the State; and, (3) the fees attributed to Historically Black Colleges and
Universities, tribally controlled community colleges, and Navajo Community Colleges that are exempt from losing
eligibility to participate in the FFEL Program under section 435(a)(2) of the HEA, if it is determined that such schools
are not responsible for their contribution to the State's fee.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of these proposed regulations,
the Secretary has determined that the benefits of the proposed regulations justify the costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary has also determined that this regulatory action does not unduly interfere with State, local, and tribal
governments in the exercise of their governmental functions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist the Department in complying with the specific requirements of Executive Order 12866, the Secretary invites
comment on whether there may be further opportunities to reduce any potential costs or increase potential benefits
resulting from these proposed regulations without impeding the effective and efficient administration of the Title
IV, HEA programs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Executive order 12866 requires each agency to write regulations that are easy to understand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary invites comments on how to make these regulations easier to understand, including answers to questions
such as the following: (1) Are the requirements in the regulations clearly stated? (2) Do the regulations contain
technical terms or other wording that interferes with their clarity? (3) Does the format of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the regulations (grouping and order of sections, use of headings, paragraphing, etc.) aid or reduce their clarity?
Would the regulations be easier to understand if they were divided into more (but shorter) sections? (A ``section''
is preceded by the symbol ``&sect;'' and a numbered heading; for example, &sect;682.410 Fiscal, administrative
and enforcement requirements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (4) Is the description of the proposed regulations in the ``Supplementary Information'' section of this preamble
helpful in the understanding of the proposed regulations? How could this description be more helpful in making the
proposed regulations easier to understand? (5) What else could the Department do to make the regulations easier to
understand? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A copy of any comments that concern whether these proposed regulations are easy to understand should also be sent to

The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Certain reporting, recordkeeping, and compliance requirements are imposed on guaranty
agencies, lenders, schools, and States by the regulations. These requirements, however, would not have a significant
impact because the regulations would not impose excessive regulatory burdens or require unnecessary Federal supervision.
