Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule has been determined to be significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and, therefore, has been reviewed
by OMB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Major importers of U.S. wheat such as Japan, China, Mexico, and Korea have indicated a strong interest in having U.S.
grain officially tested for the presence of specific pesticide residues. FGIS will be offering certification of
these specific pesticide levels for export and domestic wheat. The anticipated volume of requests for this service
is 500 samples per year or 10 per week. This represents approximately $100,000 per year, which will reimburse the costs
of providing the service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FGIS has provided official pesticide residue testing under the Agricultural Marketing Act since the early 1980's.
Producers, grain handlers, processors, and foreign buyers of U.S. grain expect FGIS to provide an impartial assessment
of grain quality as required by its legislative authority. FGIS, in turn, responds to industry requests by developing
testing procedures and soliciting comments regarding the specific action before implementation. It is participants
in the grain industry who determine who should conduct the analysis based on the documentation needed to fulfill contract
requirements established by the grain market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Federal Grain Inspection Service has determined that this proposed
action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12778 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to
have retroactive effect. The USGSA provides in Section 87g that no State or subdivision may require or impose any requirements
or restrictions concerning the inspection, weighing, or description of grain under the Act. This final rule will
not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with
this rule. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions
of this rule.

Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
David Shipman, Acting Administrator, FGIS, has determined that this final rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.)
because most users of the official inspection and weighing services and those entities that perform these services
do not meet the requirements for small entities.

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35), the information collection requirements
contained in part 800 have been previously approved by OMB under control number 0580&hyph;0013.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 28, 1994, FGIS published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 9424) a proposed rule entitled ``Fees for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Official Pesticide Residue Testing.'' These fees were established for a new service to provide official pesticide
residue determinations for 29 pesticides in wheat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the early 1980's, FGIS has provided official service under the Agricultural Marketing Act (AMA) to test grain
and processed grain products for three pesticide residues: carbon tetrachloride, methyl bromide, and ethylene
dibromide. This service is available upon request from the FGIS Commodity Testing Laboratory in Beltsville, MD.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FGIS is expanding its pesticide residue testing program to include testing wheat for 29 additional pesticides under
the authority of the USGSA. The service will be performed on a request basis; it will not be required for either domestic
or export shipments. All samples will be tested at the FGIS Technical Center in Kansas City, MO. A minimum of 500 grams
of wheat will be required for testing. The residues (routine compounds) that will be certified are as follows: aldrin;
azinphos-methyl; alpha-BHC; beta-BHC; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delta-BHC; carbofuran; chlorpyrifos; chlorothalonil; chlorpyrifos-methyl; p,p
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;-DDD; p,p
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;-DDE; 3-p,p
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;-DDT; diclofop-methyl; dieldrin; dimethoate; endosulfan; endrin; esfenvalerate; fenitrothion; fenthion;
folpet; lindane; malathion; methidathion; methoxychlor; parathion; parathion-methyl; pirimiphos-methyl;
and triallate. These compounds will be analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Laboratory analytical
results will be provided to the applicant as soon as practicable. Generally, the testing requires a minimum of 48 hours.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fees will be set forth in Section 800.71(a), Schedule A. The proposed fee is $200 for each sample tested during a
regular workday and $300 for each sample tested during a nonregular workday. The USGSA, as amended, (7 U.S.C. 71 et
seq.) provides that FGIS charge and collect reasonable fees that cover its estimated cost of performing official
inspection, weighing, reinspection, and appeal services. The fees are to cover, as nearly as practicable, the FGIS
costs for performance of these official services, including related administrative and supervisory costs. The
testing fee does not include charges for sampling. Sampling service fees, if required, will be assessed in accordance
with the sampling rates in Section 800.71(a), Schedule A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Testing for additional residues (special compounds) within FGIS capabilities will be charged at a proposed rate
of $100 per hour during a regular workday and $150 per hour during a non regular workday. Testing of residues in other
grains, oilseeds, and commodities may be provided as a service at a later date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Major importers of U.S. wheat such as Japan, China, Mexico, and Korea have indicated a strong interest in having U.S.
grain officially tested for the presence of specific pesticide residues. FGIS will be offering certification of
these specific pesticide levels for export and domestic wheat. The anticipated volume of requests for this service
is 500 samples per year or 10 per week. This represents approximately $100,000 per year, which will reimburse the costs
of providing the service.

Comment Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the 30-day comment period, three comments were filed in response to the proposal. The two comments in support
of the proposal were received from a grain industry association and a state department of agriculture. A third comment
in opposition to the proposal was filed by an independent (private) laboratory association and was received after
the close of the comment period.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment in support of the proposal encouraged FGIS to use statistically valid quality control methods in offering
pesticide testing. The commentor also requested that the testing not be mandatory. In addition, the commentor asked
about the memorandum of understanding between FGIS and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In response to the
comment, the testing service will be performed on a request basis; it will not be required for either domestic or export
wheat shipments. Grain samples 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that have been officially sampled and determined to contain violative levels of pesticide residues will be reported
to the FDA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another comment in support of the proposal stated that the service would help to strengthen the marketing of U.S. wheat
abroad and the service would meet importers' needs for more thorough testing for pesticide residues. The commentor
also pointed out that importers often request official testing rather than what is offered by private laboratories
and that only FGIS would be able to provide a chain-of-custody for the tested products from sampling to analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third comment was received after the 30-day comment period. This comment objected to FGIS testing on the grounds
that the government would be competing with private laboratories. FGIS has provided official pesticide residue
testing under the AMA on pesticide residue since the early 1980's. Producers, grain handlers, processors, and foreign
buyers of U.S. grain expect FGIS to provide impartial assessment of grain quality as required by its legislative authority.
FGIS, is turn, responds to industry requests by developing testing procedures and soliciting comments regarding
the specific action before implementation. It is participants in the grain industry who ultimately determine who
will conduct the analysis (FGIS or independent lab) based on documentation needed to fulfill contract requirements
established by the grain market.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Board is publishing amendments to Regulation DD (Truth in Savings) and the official staff commentary to implement
recent changes made to the Truth in Savings Act by the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act
of 1994. The law narrows the scope of accounts covered by the Truth in Savings Act to accounts held by individuals for
a personal, family or household purpose. Accounts held by unincorporated nonbusiness associations of individuals
are no longer subject to Truth in Savings requirements. The amendments to Regulation DD would merely implement this
change by deleting references to ``unincorporated nonbusiness associations of individuals.'' The Board has made
a finding that publishing a proposed amendment for comment is unnecessary and contrary to the public interest; therefore,
the amendment is adopted in final form.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the Truth in Savings Act (12 U.S.C. 4301 et seq.) is to assist consumers in comparing deposit accounts
offered by depository institutions. Institutions must disclose fees, the interest rate, the annual percentage
yield (APY), and other account terms whenever a consumer requests the information and before an account is opened.
Fees and other information also must be provided on any periodic statement sent to the consumer. Deposit account advertisements
and advance notices to account holders of adverse changes in terms are also covered. The act restricts how institutions
determine the account balance on which interest is calculated. The act is implemented by the Board's Regulation DD
(12 CFR part 230). (See final rule published on September 21, 1992 (57 FR 43337), correction notice published on October
9, 1992 (57 FR 46480), and amendments published on March 19, 1993 (58 FR 15077).) An official staff commentary was published
on August 8, 1994 (59 FR 40217).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Regulatory Amendment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 was enacted September 23, 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;325,
108 Stat. 2160). Section 332 of the act amends the Truth in Savings Act. The amendment narrows the scope of covered accounts
to those held by individuals primarily for personal, family or household purposes. Accounts held by unincorporated
nonbusiness associations of individuals are no longer covered by Truth in Savings, effective on the law's date of
enactment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board is adopting amendments to the regulation and commentary to implement this change. The Administrative Procedure
Act provides that notice and opportunity for public comment are not required if the Board finds that notice and public
comment are unnecessary or would be contrary to the public interest. 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B). The Board believes such a
finding is appropriate in this case. The Congress has eliminated a class of accounts from Truth in Savings coverage,
and the amendments merely effect that change. These amendments_which only delete references to accounts held by
unincorporated nonbusiness associations of individuals_are technical and not subject to interpretation. In light
of the Congress' action, the Board has no discretion with regard to this regulatory change. It is essentially ministerial.
The Board is required by law to amend Regulation DD in the manner proposed. This amendment to 12 CFR part 230 relieves
depository institutions from the requirement that they treat ``unincorporated nonbusiness associations of individuals''
as ``consumers'' under Regulation DD. Because this regulatory amendment eliminates requirements, it is effective
September, 23, 1994_the effective date of the statutory amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, the Board has determined that publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking and providing opportunity
for public comment for the following amendments is unnecessary and would be contrary to the public interest.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The FDIC has adopted final amendments concerning delegations of authority and other technical amendments to its
regulations in order to reflect the name, duties and powers of the FDIC's new Division of Compliance and Consumer Affairs,
which was established under a recent internal reorganization. The Division of Compliance and Consumer Affairs was
created by abolishing the FDIC's Office of Consumer Affairs and transferring its functions, as well as those of the
FDIC's Division of Supervision relating to compliance with consumer protection, fair lending, community reinvestment,
civil rights, and other laws not directly affecting the safety and soundness of depository institutions, to the new
division. The intended effect of these amendments is to provide officials in the new division with appropriate delegated
authority and to make other technical and conforming amendments.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On August 29, 1994, the Acting Chairman of the Board of the FDIC approved a reorganization of the Corporation resulting
in the establishment of a new Division of Compliance and Consumer Affairs. This was accomplished by abolishing the
Office of Consumer Affairs and transferring its functions and duties to the new division. The functions and duties
of the Division of Supervision relating to compliance with consumer protection, fair lending, community reinvestment,
civil rights, and other laws not directly affecting the safety and soundness of depository institutions were also
transferred to the new division. The Board adopted a resolution on August 30, 1994 approving the restructuring in
order to reaffirm and strengthen its commitment to enforcing consumer protection, fair lending, community reinvestment,
and civil rights laws and to better utilize FDIC resources.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FDIC has identified portions of its regulations that will be directly affected by the aforementioned corporate
reorganization and thus require modification. These amendments include delegations of authority and other technical
amendments to part 303 as well as a technical amendment to part 338.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
A. Amendments to Part 303
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Part 303 of the FDIC's regulations generally sets forth the procedures to be followed by both the FDIC and applicants
with respect to applications, requests, or notices required to be filed by statute or regulation. Part 303 also currently
sets forth delegations of authority from the FDIC's Board of Directors to the Director of the Division of Supervision,
associate directors, regional directors and deputy regional directors of that division to act on certain applications
and other matters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These amendments primarily provide delegations of authority, where appropriate, to the Director and the regional
managers of the Division of Compliance and Consumer Affairs to act on certain matters within the purview of the new
division. The amendments also replace certain obsolete terminology and legal citations with current nomenclature
and accurate citations where applicable. Specific changes are described below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=2 -->
1. Scope and Definitions (&sect;303.0)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The description of the scope of part 303 has been revised to reflect the delegations of authority added to part 303 for
the new Division of Compliance and Consumer Affairs as well as to reflect that part 303 prescribes where applications,
requests and notices required to be filed by statute or regulation should be filed. Definitions of ``Director (DCA)''
and ``regional manager'' have been added to reflect the management of the new Division of Compliance and Consumer
Affairs. The new term ``DCA'' has been added and defined to mean the Division of Compliance and Consumer Affairs or
any successor thereto. The term ``Director'' has been revised to ``Director (DOS)''. The term ``Associate Director''
has been redefined to include any associate director of the Division of Supervision or the Division of Compliance
and Consumer Affairs. The revisions clarify that the terms ``associate director,'' ``regional director,'' ``deputy
regional director,'' ``Associate General Counsel for Compliance and Enforcement,'' and ``regional counsel''
include officials of equivalent authority. A definition of ``institution-affiliated party'' has replaced the
term ``individual'' throughout, incorporating by reference the meaning provided in 12 U.S.C. 1813(u). The term
``order of correction'' relating to actions terminating deposit insurance has been replaced with the term ``notification
to primary regulator,'' which is the nomenclature currently found in 12 U.S.C. 1818(a). The definition of ``notice
of assessment of civil penalties'' has been revised to conform with current law. The term ``final order to pay'' relating
to the assessment of civil money penalties has been deleted as unnecessary, and the term ``amended order to pay'' added
to provide for orders which change the amount originally assessed in civil money penalty actions. The definition
of ``total assets'' has been revised and a definition of ``Tier 1 capital'' added, incorporating by reference the
definitions found at 12 CFR 325.2(n) and (m), respectively. The term ``protest'' has been revised to reflect the appropriate
regional manager's duties with respect to Community Reinvestment Act protests. Section 303.0(c)(1) has been added
to explain that any authority delegated to the Director of the Division of Supervision or the Director of the Division
of Compliance and Consumer Affairs may be exercised by the Executive Director, Divisions of Compliance, Resolutions
and Supervision. Similarly, &sect;303.0(c)(2) explains that any authority delegated to the regional manager may,
where confirmed in writing, be exercised by his or her principal assistant. Finally, &sect;303.0(d) is added to clarify
that, if appropriate, any use of the singular includes the plural and the plural includes the singular and that any
use of the masculine, feminine or neuter gender encompasses all three.

This section has been amended to provide delegations of authority to the Director and the regional manager of the Division
of Compliance and Consumer Affairs to authorize investigations and examinations pursuant to this section as deemed
appropriate. Upon receipt of any report of investigation or examination, authority is delegated to the Director
or regional manager of the new division to take any action determined necessary or appropriate under the circumstances.

where confirmed in writing, the associate director or the appropriate regional manager, in the exercise of authority
under this section.

References throughout the section have been revised to include the authority of the Director of the Division of Compliance
and Consumer Affairs or designee to act on certain enforcement matters involving consumer compliance issues. With
respect to enforcement matters involving both safety and soundness and consumer compliance matters, authority
to act is delegated to the Director of the Division of Supervision and the Director of the Division of Compliance and
Consumer Affairs, or their designees, jointly.

This section continues to allow for the delegation of authority to various Division of Supervision personnel to initiate
termination of insurance actions pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1818(a). However, it replaces the obsolete term, ``order
of correction'', with the current term, ``notification to primary regulator'', and provides that the delegates
may act when the insured depository institution's Tier 1 capital is less than 2% of its total assets, which is essentially
the current delegation updated to reflect changes in the capital regulations. Paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) modify
the certification requirements to conform with the terminology currently found in 12 U.S.C. 1818(a).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These sections have been changed to provide delegations of authority to both the Director of the Division of Supervision
and the Director of the Division of Compliance and Consumer Affairs to initiate actions pursuant to sections 8 (b)

of Supervision and the Division of Compliance and Consumer Affairs when both safety and soundness and consumer compliance
matters will be addressed in the action.

In this section, the term ``individual'' is replaced with the current terminology, ``institution-affiliated party.''
The section has also been revised to provide delegations of authority to both the Director of the Division of Supervision
and the Director of the Division of Compliance and Consumer Affairs and, where confirmed in writing, to an associate
director to issue notices of intent to remove from office pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1818(e). The amendment also provides

The delegations have been revised to provide delegated authority to the Director of the Division of Supervision and
the Director of the Division of Compliance and Consumer Affairs to issue orders of suspension or prohibition pursuant
to section 8(g) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act). The amendment also provides for the joint issuance
of such orders by the Division of Supervision and the Division of Compliance and Consumer Affairs when both safety
and soundness and consumer compliance matters will be addressed in the action. The language has also been revised
to conform with the statute as it currently reads. Hence, the reference to ``indicted director, officer or person
participating in the conduct of the affairs'' has been replaced with ``institution-affiliated party who is charged
in any information, indictment, or complaint as set forth in section 8(g) of the Act.''

Current &sect;303.9 delegates to the Director of the Division of Supervision and, where confirmed in writing, an
associate director the authority to issue notices of assessment of civil money penalties. The amendment provides
an additional delegation of authority to the Director of the Division of Compliance and Consumer Affairs and, where
confirmed in writing, to an associate director of that division. The amendment also provides for the issuance of joint
notices of assessment of civil money penalties by the Division of Supervision and the Division of Compliance and Consumer

of Liquidation and, where confirmed in writing, to an associate director or the appropriate regional director or
deputy regional director and the General Counsel or his designee to issue an order of investigation pursuant to section
10(c) of the Act. This section has been amended to include a delegation of authority to the Director of the Division
of Compliance and Consumer Affairs and, where confirmed in writing, to the appropriate regional manager of that division.
The amendment also provides for the joint issuance of an order of investigation by the Director of the Division of Supervision
and the Director of the Division of Compliance and Consumer Affairs when both safety and soundness and consumer compliance
matters will be a subject of the investigation. The reference to ``Division of Liquidation'' has been changed to ``Division
of Depositor and Asset Services'' to reflect an earlier title change for that division. The reference to the relevant
FDIC regulation is updated to specify the current citation, which is subpart K of part 308.

where a proceeding was issued jointly by DOS and DCA, both Directors, or their designees, must agree to accept, deny
or enter into any negotiations for unilateral settlement offers. Section 303.9(l) has also been amended to provide
that in cases where both safety and soundness and consumer compliance matters are addressed, joint written agreements
may be entered into. Section 303.9(l)(2) has further been amended to broaden the scope of authority delegated to both
directors, and where confirmed in writing by either director, to an associate director, to accept or enter into written

unchanged, but language is added to clarify that notifications and notices are included in the types of actions that

remains substantially unchanged.

B. Amendment to Part 338 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Part 338 is amended by changing the address on the Equal Housing Lender Poster contained in &sect;338.4(b) of the FDIC's
regulations, 12 CFR 338.4(b), to reflect the name of the new Division of Compliance and Consumer Affairs.

Exemption From Public Comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Rules of agency organization, procedure or practice are exempt from public comment requirements of section 553 of
the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A)). The FDIC believes that it is unnecessary to seek public comment
in this case because these amendments concern rules of agency organization, procedure or practice which fall within
this exemption. Therefore, the amendments are being issued as a final, rather than proposed, rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Effective Date of Amendments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) generally requires that a final rule be published 30
days prior to its effective date, subject to certain exceptions. One such exception is that if an agency finds good
cause for making a rule immediately effective and publishes the basis for such finding, then the rule need not be published
30 days prior to its effective date. 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3). These amendments merely concern internal delegations of
authority and do not affect any substantive rights. Therefore, the FDIC Board of Directors finds good cause to waive
the 30-day delayed effective date in order to quickly effectuate the corporate reorganization and to provide the
new Division of Compliance and Consumer Affairs with appropriate legal authority to carry out its functions and duties.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) is amending the existing regulations governing its Affordable Housing Disposition
Program (AHDP). The amendments set forth in this interim final rule are necessary because the Resolution Trust Corporation
Refinancing, Restructuring and Improvement Act of 1991 (Refinancing Act), the Departments of Veterans Affairs,
Housing and Urban Development and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act of 1992 (1992 Appropriations Act), the
Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (1992 Housing Act) and the Resolution Trust Corporation Completion
Act of 1993 (Completion Act) changed the manner in which the RTC is to identify, market and sell certain affordable
housing properties. This interim final rule also clarifies certain policies of the RTC regarding the disposition
of assets in the AHDP and reflects certain comments received with respect to a previously published interim final
rule. By implementing the statutory changes required by the Refinancing Act, the 1992 Appropriations Act, the 1992
Housing Act and the Completion Act, and clarifying certain provisions of the AHDP and making the other changes set
forth herein, these regulations will enhance the availability and affordability of residential real property for
very-low income, lower-income and moderate-income families and individuals.

On August 31, 1990 (55 FR 35564), the RTC published a final rule establishing the procedures to be followed by the RTC
in connection with the sale of eligible residential properties to qualifying purchasers under the AHDP. Those procedures
were established in accordance with the affordable housing provisions of section 21A(c) of the Federal Home Loan
Bank Act, as amended by section 501 of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA)
(12 U.S.C. 1441a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 6, 1992 (57 FR 19500), the RTC published an interim final rule and request for comments (May 6, 1992 Interim Rule).
That publication implemented some of the statutory changes made to the AHDP by the Refinancing Act and clarified the
RTC's policies on a number of issues relating to the disposition of assets in the AHDP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On June 12, 1992 (57 FR 24937), the RTC published an interim statement of policy. That publication provided that when
more than one multifamily property is purchased from the RTC under the AHDP, the RTC will require that not less than
15 percent of the dwelling units in each separate property purchased be made available to low or very-low income individuals.
The final statement of policy was published on August 19, 1992 (57 FR 37581) and reflected no significant changes from
the interim statement of policy.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This interim final rule differs from the May 6, 1992 Interim Rule in several ways: (1) It implements several statutory
changes made to the AHDP by the Refinancing Act and not reflected in the May 6 1992 interim final rule; (2) It implements
a number of statutory changes made to the AHDP by the enactment of the 1992 Appropriations Act, the 1992 Housing Act
and the Completion Act; (3) It further clarifies RTC policies relating to the disposition of assets within the AHDP.

property are modified to substitute specific value limits for the former references to various sections of the National
Housing Act of 1934, as amended (National Housing Act). In order to implement section 12 of the Completion Act, the
definitions of eligible condominium property and eligible single family property are modified to permit specific
maximum values higher than those set by the National Housing Act so long as Congress has appropriated funds for such
purpose. To implement section 601 of the Refinancing Act, the definition of eligible multifamily property is modified
to permit the inclusion of conservatorship properties, if Congress appropriates funds for that purposes. Public
Citizen, Inc. requested that the definition of eligible multifamily property be extended generally to include otherwise
eligible conservatorship properties. In view of section 12 of the Completion Act, this interim final rule goes as
far in that direction as the RTC believes is permissible without a Congressional appropriation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Section 14(a) of the Completion Act is implemented in this interim final rule by a requirement that the RTC send
notices to clearinghouses of the availability for sale of certain properties which are ``ineligible'' under the
AHDP program. ``Ineligible properties'' include (a) properties that would otherwise be eligible condominium property
or eligible single family property, but have values above the applicable AHDP limits and within certain higher limits
set forth in the statute (if Congress has not appropriated funds to include such properties as eligible), and (b) properties
that would be eligible multifamily property but for being owned by the RTC in its capacity as conservator (if Congress
has not appropriated funds to include such properties as eligible). The clearinghouse is required to make such notice
available to qualifying purchasers, as well as other purchasers, as appropriate and technical assistance advisors
are permitted to perform a similar function.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Consistent with the interim and final statements of policy discussed above, the definition of lower-income occupancy
requirement(s) applicable to eligible multifamily properties sold in a bulk sale is revised to require that at least
15 percent of the units in each property must be made available for low- or very low-income families.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The marketing period continues to be 97 days for eligible single family property, but the definition permits a
longer marketing period to the extent Congress appropriates funds for such purpose.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Section 14(d) of the Completion Act is being implemented to increase participation by minority-owned and women-owned
businesses in the AHDP. The interim final rule requires that brokers and RTC staff provide, to a wide range of minority-owned
and women-owned businesses and minority-controlled nonprofit organizations, each engaged in providing affordable
housing, information concerning the availability of purchase money loans under section 21A(c)(6)(A)(ii) of the
Federal Home Loan Bank Act (12 U.S.C. 1441a(c)(6)(A)(ii)). Clearinghouses and technical assistance advisors are
also authorized to provide such information to such parties. In addition to the explicit requirements, the interim
final rule includes various definitions concerning this aspect of the AHDP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The definition of nonprofit organization is modified to limit the opportunity for for-profit individuals or
entities to benefit from such status.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The definition of public agency is clarified to include entities operating under executive, legislative or judicial
authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Consistent with current RTC directive, the interim final rule requires that the RTC send clearinghouses notices
containing information concerning properties with appraised values or values determined by the RTC which exceed
the applicable AHDP values. These properties (including the ``ineligible'' single family and condominium properties
discussed in paragraph (2) above) will not be marketed or sold as a part of the AHDP, and may be sold to any purchaser if
the sales price exceeds the applicable maximum AHDP value. However, if the sales price falls below the applicable
maximum value, these ``non-AHDP properties'' may only be sold, initially, to a qualifying purchaser. This change
is consistent with a suggestion made by Public Citizen, Inc.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) The RTC's authority to issue a second Notice of Marketing Period for unsold properties has been expanded to cover
single family properties and condominium units.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) The provisions concerning eligible multifamily properties are being clarified to reflect that if a purchaser
makes a commitment to reserve a higher proportion of properties for very low income families, that commitment must
be reflected in the LURA for such property.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(11) The provisions concerning rent restrictions applicable to AHDP properties are being clarified to reflect that
family size adjustments for purposes of determining rent will be based on unit size, rather than household size.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(12) The provisions describing the property listing which must accompany a Notice of Marketing Period are being revised
to conform more closely to statutory requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(13) In order to implement section 609 of the Refinancing Act, the RTC will be required to establish a net realizable
market value for an eligible multifamily property, which value will be a minimum sales price in all cases, except for
expedited sales to public agencies or nonprofit organizations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(14) Clarification and an addition examples are provided as to the preference given, with respect to the bulk sale
of eligible condominium properties, to sales that will benefit the larger number of very low- and low-income households.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(15) The provisions concerning bulk sales of eligible condomium property and eligible multifamily property are
modified to permit the RTC, when a bulk package is being marketed, to sell individual properties to qualifying purchasers.
Public Citizen, Inc. had suggested such a revision with respect to eligible multifamily property. This interim final
rule goes a step further by making a similar revision with respect to eligible condominium property.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(16) The provision which specifies the information to be provided in reports to Congress concerning the AHDP, has
been revised so that it more closely tracks the statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(17) The provision of &sect;1609.11 which addresses public agencies that acquire properties under the AHDP has been
expanded to specify the particular lower-income requirements that apply.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(18) Consistent with existing RTC policy, a new subsection 1609.9(b) has been added which provides that, with respect
to eligible multifamily property, the RTC will offer such property, initially, for direct sale exclusively to public
agencies and nonprofit organizations for a period of 45 days. If the RTC receives no notice of serious interest, the
property will be marketed pursuant to section 1609.7.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other stylistic changes to the regulations have also been made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the length of the interim final rule and the number of changes from the May 6, 1992 Interim Rule, this interim
final rule is published in its entirety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Administrative Procedure Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The RTC is adopting this regulation as an interim final regulation. It will be effective immediately upon publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, without the usual notice-and-comment period or delayed effective date as provided for in the Administrative Procedure
Act, 5 U.S.C. 553. These requirements may be waived for ``good cause''. The RTC believes that good cause exists because
the amendments made to the affordable housing provisions of FIRREA by the Refinancing Act, the 1992 Appropriations
Act, the 1992 Housing Act and the Completion Act took effect immediately upon their enactment. Moreover, immediate
clarification of existing policies is necessary in order to avoid undue delays in the disposition of affordable housing
properties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By implementing these changes immediately, the RTC is complying with the mandate from Congress to dispose of single
family, multifamily and condominium properties expeditiously and to the benefit of low and moderate income households.
The immediate effective date of the regulation is also desirable in order to avoid public confusion regarding the
RTC's policies and procedures in this area. Such confusion could impede the sales of affordable housing properties
and result in deterioration of existing inventory and increased holding costs associated with these properties.
Such costs ultimately would be borne by the taxpayer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, the RTC finds that the benefits to the public in adopting an interim final rule outweigh any harm
from the delay in seeking public comment. The RTC solicits comments and will consider those comments in the adoption
of the rule as final, which will take place within 90 days after the close of the public period.

As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq., the following initial regulatory flexibility
analysis is hereby provided:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Reasons, objectives, and legal bases underlying the interim final regulations. These elements have been discussed
elsewhere in the preamble.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Impact of the interim final regulations on small businesses: This interim final rule is not expected to have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The RTC expects, rather, that the interim final regulation
will result in a benefit to small business entities whose service will be utilized in fulfilling the mandates of the
legislation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Overlapping or conflicting federal rules. There are no known federal rules which overlap, duplicate, or conflict
with the interim final regulations.

the same 10 eligible single family properties for $325,000 and intends to reserve all of the properties for occupancy
and purchase by lower-income families (but not very low-income families). Although Y has offered more for the properties,
the properties should be sold to nonprofit organization X for $300,000.

in interest, with the provision that the property may subsequently be sold to a lower-income family without further
deed restrictions (except applicable recapture restrictions). The LURA or other recorded legal instrument shall
also require the property owner to rent such properties at affordable rates, to cooperate with periodic compliance
reviews and to pay a reasonable fee to cover the cost of the reviews. The LURA or other recorded instrument shall reflect
any commitment, made in accordance with a purchase offer pursuant to paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section, to reserve

for the longest term.

Thus, for example, rent for a 3-bedroom unit occupied by a very low-income family will be based upon the HUD-determined
income for a household at 50% of area median income which has 5 members. The rent for a 2-bedroom unit occupied by a lower-income
household will be based upon the HUD figure for a household at 65% of median income which has 3 members.

sell each eligible multifamily property at a price no less than the estimated net realizable market value unless sale
at a lower price is necessary to facilitate an expedited sale of such property and to enable a public agency or nonprofit
organization to comply with the applicable lower-income occupancy requirements. If the RTC receives an offer higher

 (i) If, before the expiration of the period for submission of bona fide offers, an offer to purchase a property initially
accepted by the RTC is subsequently rejected or fails (for any reason), the RTC shall accept another offer to purchase
the property that complies with the terms and conditions established by the RTC (if another offer was made during the
period for submission of bona fide offers). This provision does not require a qualifying multifamily purchaser whose
offer is accepted during the bona fide offer period to purchase the property before the expiration of that period.

(i) In choosing among bona fide offers for eligible multifamily property, the RTC will give preference to the offer
that would reserve the highest percentage of dwelling units for occupancy by very low-income families and lower-income
families and would retain such affordability for the longest term (not exceeding the term of the deed restrictions).
For purposes of making calculations pursuant to this paragraph (b)(9) alone, as described in the following examples,
``lower-income families'' shall mean families and individuals whose incomes are greater than 50 percent of area
median income but do not exceed 80 percent of area median income, as defined under 42 U.S.C. 1437a(b)(2) and as determined
by the Secretary of HUD, with adjustment for family size. The preference will be calculated in accordance with the

B offers to purchase the same eligible multifamily property for $900,000 and intends to reserve 50% of the units for
occupancy by very low-income families and 50% for occupancy by lower-income families. Multifamily purchaser C offers
to purchase the eligible multifamily property for $1,015,000 and agrees to reserve 20% of the units for occupancy

 Prior to listing an eligible condominium property with a clearinghouse, the RTC, in its sole discretion, will determine
whether to offer the property for sale individually or as part of a bulk sale package of multiple eligible condominium
properties. Subject to paragraph (c)(4)(vii) of this section, the composition of a bulk sale package will be determined
solely by the RTC prior to listing the properties with a clearinghouse. Properties listed for sale on an individual
basis will be available for purchase by qualifying households only. Properties listed as part of a bulk sale package
may be purchased by nonprofit organizations, public agencies or for-profit entities. After 90 days of marketing,
properties listed for individual sales may be relisted as part of a bulk sale package for the remaining 90 days.

 The Secretary, the RTC or its successor, or the State housing finance agency for the State in which the property is located
may temporarily reduce the lower-income occupancy requirements applicable to a property sold under this program
if the Secretary or the applicable State housing finance agency determines that an owner's compliance with such requirements
is no longer financially feasible. The owner of the property shall make a good-faith effort to return lower-income
occupancy to the level required by the property's LURA, and the agency, as appropriate, shall review the reduction
annually to determine whether financial infeasibility continues to exist.

 In choosing among bulk purchase offers from nonprofit organizations, public agencies and for-profit entities,
the RTC will give preference to the offer that would reserve the highest percentage of dwelling units for occupancy
or purchase by very low-income families and lower-income families and would retain such affordability for the longest
term (not exceeding the term of the LURA). The preference will be calculated in accordance with the following formula:

in response to bulk sale offers with respect to which the RTC has determined to waive the 100 percent lower-income occupancy
requirement pursuant to paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, 0.125% of the cash equivalent offer for each 1% of the
units set aside for occupancy by lower-income families that exceeds the applicable lower-income unit requirement;
provided, however, that very low-income units receiving a 0.25% preference for purposes of the preceding clause,

binding upon successors in interest, with the provision that the property may subsequently be sold to a lower-income
family without further deed restrictions (except for recapture restrictions). The deed or other recorded legal
instrument shall also require the property owner to cooperate with periodic compliance reviews and to pay a reasonable

(a) The RTC may, for such period of time as it determines appropriate, suspend any of the rules governing the marketing
or sale of eligible residential property set forth in this part, if during such period the RTC negotiates the sale of
any such property to a nonprofit organization or public agency. If the property is not sold pursuant to such negotiations,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) When an eligible multifamily property is ready for sale, and prior to sending the Notice of Marketing Period to
clearinghouses pursuant to &sect;1609.7(b)(1) of this part, the RTC shall suspend such marketing period and offer
such property exclusively to public agencies and nonprofit organizations serving the jurisdiction or area in which
such property is located. The marketing period for direct sales to public agencies and nonprofit organizations shall
be forty-five (45) days from the date on which the notice of marketing period is mailed by the RTC. If the RTC receives
no notices of serious interest from public agencies or nonprofit organizations during such marketing period, then
the RTC shall offer such property to all qualifying multifamily purchasers pursuant to &sect;1609.7(b) of this part.

(a) To the extent practicable, within a reasonable period of time after acquiring title to any non-AHDP property (including
an ineligible condominium property or an ineligible single family property) or to an ineligible multifamily property,
the RTC shall provide written notice to the clearinghouses. For single family properties, the notice shall contain
the same information about the properties that the notice required under &sect;1609.7(a)(1)(ii) of this part contains
with respect to eligible single family properties. For multifamily properties, the notice shall contain the same
information about the properties that the notice required under &sect;1609.7(b)(1)(ii) of this part contains with
respect to eligible multifamily properties. For condominium properties, the notice shall contain the same information
about such properties as the notice required under &sect;1609.7(c)(1)(iv) of this part contains with respect to
eligible condominium properties. Each notice also shall state that the property is not being sold or marketed through
the AHDP. With respect to a non-AHDP property (including an ineligible condominium property or an ineligible single
family property), the notice shall state that any purchaser may purchase the property at a sales price above the maximum
value set out in &sect;&sect;1609.2(j)(2), 1609.2(k)(2) or &sect;1609.2(m)(2) of this part, as applicable, but
only a qualifying purchaser may purchase the property at a sales price below such maximum value.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Any person or entity may purchase a non-AHDP property for a sales price above the maximum value set out in &sect;&sect;1609.2(j)(2),
1609.2(k)(2) or &sect;1609.2(m)(2) of this part, as applicable, but only a qualifying purchaser may purchase such
a property at a sales price below such maximum value. If the RTC is unable to sell a non-AHDP property in compliance with
the requirements of the preceding sentence, then the RTC may dispose of the property in such manner as it determines
appropriate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 15, 1994, the Federal Aviation Administration issued a final rule requiring air carriers, air taxi, and
commercial operators to provide duty period scheduling limitations and rest requirements for flight attendants
engaged in air transportation and air commerce [59 FR 42974; August 19, 1994]. At the time of issuance, the burden associated
with the recordkeeping requirements had not been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB); therefore,
those sections of the final rule did not have an effective date. On August 17, 1994, OMB approved the burden associated
with the recordkeeping requirements under OMB Control No. 2120&hyph;0585 through July 31, 1997. The FAA hereby gives
notice of that approval and the effective date for the affected sections of the final rule. A copy of the OMB approval
may be examined in Docket No. 27229 in the FAA Rules Docket, room 915G, 800 Independence Ave., SW, Washington, DC 20591.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
These special conditions are issued for Fokker Model F28 Mark 0070 airplanes manufactured by Fokker Aircraft B.V.
of Schiphol the Netherlands. These airplanes are equipped with electrical and electronic systems (such as the digital
electronic flight instrument system (EFIS)), which perform critical functions. The applicable regulations do
not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for the protection of these systems from the effects of high-intensity
radiated fields (HIRF). These special conditions provide the additional safety standards that the Administrator
considers necessary to ensure that the critical functions performed by these systems are maintained when the airplane
is exposed to HIRF.

Background

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 17, 1993, Fokker Aircraft B.V. of Schiphol the Netherlands, applied for an amendment to Type Certificate
A20EU to incorporate the Model F28 Mark 0070. This airplane is a derivative of the Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100, approved
April 21, 1989. The changes include: removal of two plug sections forward and aft of the wing to decrease overall length
by 182 inches; two cargo doors in lieu of three; modifications of the aft cargo door due to space constraints associated
with the shorter fuselage; one pair of Type III overwing exists in lieu of two pair, and a new nose wheel tire chine. Both
the Model F28 Mark 0070 and new production of the Model F28 Mark 0100 will incorporate a hydraulic stick pusher in lieu
of a pneumatic stick pusher, new stabilizer control unit, and a new interior. The Model F28 Mark 0070 will have a maximum
seating capacity of 79 passengers.

Amended Type Certification Basis

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the provisions of &sect;21.101 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR), Fokker must show that the Model F28
Mark 0070 meets the applicable provisions of the regulations incorporated by reference in Type Certificate No. A20EU,
or the applicable regulations in effect on the date of application for the Model F28 Mark 0070. The regulations incorporated
by reference in the type certificate are commonly referred to as the ``original type certification basis.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations incorporated by reference in Type Certificate No. A20EU for the Model F28 Mark 0070 are part 25 of the
FAR, as amended by Amendment 25&hyph;1 through 25&hyph;60 with certain exceptions which are not relevant to these
special conditions. In addition, Fokker has elected to show compliance with certain later requirements which are
also not relevant to these special conditions. These special conditions will form an additional part of the certification
basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the Administrator finds that the applicable airworthiness regulations (i.e., part 25, as amended) do not contain
adequate or appropriate safety standards for the Fokker Model F28 Mark 0070 because of a novel or unusual design feature,
special conditions are prescribed under the provisions of &sect;21.16 to establish a level of safety equivalent
to that established in the regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Special conditions, as appropriate, are issued in accordance with &sect;11.49 of the FAR after public notice, as
required by &sect;&sect;11.28 and 11.29, and become part of the type certification basis in accordance with &sect;21.101(b)(2).

Special conditions are initially applicable to the model for which they are issued. Should the type certificate for
that model be amended at a later date to include any other model that incorporates the same novel or unusual design feature,
or should any other model already included on the same type certificate be modified to incorporate the same novel or
unusual design feature, the special conditions would also apply to the other model under the provisions of &sect;21.101(a)(1).

Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There is no specific regulation that addresses protection requirements for electrical and electronic systems from
HIRF. Increased power levels from ground-based radio transmitters, and the growing use of sensitive electrical
and electronic systems to command and control airplanes, have made it necessary to provide adequate protection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure that a level of safety is achieved equivalent to that intended by the regulations incorporated by reference,
special conditions are needed for the Model F28 Mark 0070 that would require that the electrical and electronic systems
which perform critical functions such as the EFIS be designed and installed to preclude component damage and interruption
of function due to the effects of HIRF.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

High-Intensity Radiated Fields (HIRF)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With the trend toward increased power levels from ground-based transmitters, plus the advent of space and satellite
communications, coupled with electronic command and control of the airplane, the immunity of critical digital avionics
systems, such as the EFIS, to HIRF must be established.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is not possible to precisely define the HIRF to which the airplane will be exposed in service. There is also uncertainty
concerning the effectiveness of airframe shielding for HIRF. Furthermore, coupling to cockpit-installed equipment
through the cockpit window apertures is undefined. Based on surveys and analysis of existing HIRF emitters, an adequate
level of protection exists when compliance with the HIRF protection special condition is shown with either paragraphs
1 or 2 below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A minimum threat of 100 volts per meter peak electric field strength from 10 KHz to 18GHz.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The threat must be applied to the system elements and their associated wiring harnesses without the benefit of airframe
shielding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Demonstration of this level of protection is established through system tests and analysis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A threat external to the airframe of the following field strengths for the frequency ranges indicated.

As discussed above, these special conditions are applicable to Fokker Model F28 Mark 0070 airplanes manufactured
by Fokker Aircraft B.V. of the Netherlands. Should Fokker apply at a later date for a change to the type certificate
to include another model incorporating the same novel or unusual design feature, these special conditions would
apply to that model as well, under the provisions of &sect;21.101(a)(1).

Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action affects only certain unusual or novel design features on the Fokker Model F28 Mark 0070 airplanes. It is
not a rule of general applicability and affects only the manufacturer who applied to the FAA for approval of these features
on the airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The substance of the special conditions for these airplanes has been subjected to the notice and comment procedure
in several prior instances and has been derived without substantive change from those previously issued. It is unlikely
that prior public comment would result in a significant change from the substance contained herein. For this reason,
and because a delay would significantly affect the certification of the airplane, which is imminent, the FAA has determined
that prior public notice and comment are unnecessary and impracticable, and good cause exists for adopting these
special conditions immediately. Therefore, these special conditions are being made effective upon issuance. The
FAA is requesting comments to allow interested persons to submit views that may not have been submitted in response
to the prior opportunities for comment described above.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) maintains the Commerce Control List (CCL), which appears in the Export
Administration Regulations (EAR). This rule amends the CCL by revising Export Control Classification Number (ECCN)
1C60. This ECCN controls dual-use precursors and intermediate chemicals useful in the production of chemical warfare
agents. In addition this rule makes an editorial correction by removing ECCN 1C64E for Di-isopropylcarbodiimide
(C.A.S. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
538&hyph;75&hyph;0), which was inadvertently readmitted to the Commerce Control List. The changes made by this
rule are based on recent discussions in the Australia Group (AG). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, this rule revises the list of countries eligible to receive Australia Group (AG) benefits under U.S. regulations
to include the Czech Republic and remove Turkey.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the December 1993 meeting of the Australia Group, the delegates discussed certain technical revisions in the Australia
Group's harmonized controls on chemical weapons precursors. The changes discussed at the meeting were further modified
at the May 1994 meeting, and are contained in this interim rule. These changes refine the scope of controls on exports
of sample shipments and mixtures containing controlled precursor and intermediate chemicals. This rule does not
address controls on biological agents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim rule revises ECCN 1C60, which controls precursor and intermediate chemicals useful in the production
of chemical warfare agents, as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
ECCN 1C60 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Note 1 to 1C60 is revised to modify the general license treatment for sample shipments containing controlled chemical
precursors to eligible destinations (all destinations 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
except 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Iran, Syria, Country Groups S and Z, and countries subject to an embargo administered by the Department of the Treasury).
Previously, all 54 precursor chemicals were eligible for sample shipments. Under the revised rule &blank;&blank;&blank;&blank;
0-Ethyl-2-diisopropylaminoethyl methylphosphonite (QL) (C.A.S. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
57856&hyph;11&hyph;8), Ethylphosphonyl difluoride (C.A.S. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
753&hyph;98&hyph;0), and Methylphosphonyl difluoride (C.A.S. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
676&hyph;99&hyph;3) are 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 eligible for sample shipments. General license treatment for sample shipments to eligible destinations has been
available for a single sample shipment of a 55-gallon container or less of each chemical to any one consignee per calendar
year. Exporters may continue to export a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
single 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
sample shipment of a 55-gallon container (or approximately 200 kg) or less of each chemical except the three excluded
chemicals, for research or evaluation purposes to any one consignee per calendar year. The exporter is now required
to submit, to BXA within 30 days of each sample shipment, a written report on company letterhead stationery that details
the chemical(s), Chemical Abstract Service Registry (C.A.S.) number(s), quantity(ies), the ultimate consignee's
name and address, and the date exported. Information contained in the reports is subject to applicable confidentiality
provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Note 2 to 1C60 is revised to modify control of exports and reexports of mixtures that contain controlled chemical
precursors. Previously, controls on controlled chemicals extended to any mixtures containing those chemicals,
unless the chemical was merely an impurity that was not intentionally added or was a normal ingredient in consumer
goods intended for retail sales. This revision adds a three tier approach to a Note regarding mixtures under ECCN 1C60.
The first tier lists three chemicals that require a validated license ``regardless of the concentrations in the mixture''.
The second tier lists twenty chemicals that require a validated license when at least one of the precursors constitutes
more than 10 percent of the weight of the mixture on a solvent free basis. The third tier includes the remaining precursor
chemicals, not already covered by the first two tiers, and explains that a validated license is required if at least
one of the precursors constitutes more than 25 percent of the weight of the mixture on a solvent free basis. The retail
product exemption is continued, regardless of percentage of the controlled chemical, provided the product is formulated
as a consumer good packaged for retail sale for personal use. The exemption for unintended impurities is removed since
such impurities generally fall within one of the applicable de minimis levels. This rule also provides a definition
of ``mixtures''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the changes made by this rule, it is the Department's position that the provisions of &sect;776.12 of the
EAR do not apply to mixtures containing controlled chemical precursors, because mixing of chemicals does not constitute
incorporation within the meaning of &sect;776.12. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Turkey has been removed from the list of countries excepted from the requirement for a validated license under Export
Control Classification Number (ECCN) 1C60C. Because the Government of Turkey has not adopted AG-comparable export
controls, a validated license is required for all AG-list chemical precursors identified under ECCN 1C60C until
such time as appropriate export controls are in place.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, this rule adds the Czech Republic to the list of countries exempted from certain validated license requirements
on the basis of its recent membership in the 26-nation Australia Group. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, this rule revises &sect;778.8(a)(1)(i) for conformity and consistency.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Saving Clause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Shipments of items removed from general license authorizations as a result of this regulatory action that were on
dock for loading, on lighter, laden aboard an exporting carrier, or en route aboard a carrier to a port of export pursuant
to actual orders for export before October 19, 1994 may be exported under the previous general license provisions
up to and including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November 16, 1994. Any such items not actually exported before midnight November 16, 1994, require a validated export
license in accordance with this regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Rulemaking Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. This interim rule has been determined to be not significant for the purposes of Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. This rule involves collections of information subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). These collections have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control numbers 0694&hyph;0005,
0694&hyph;0010, 0694&hyph;0023 and 0694&hyph;0067. This rule imposes a new requirement that has been submitted
to the Office of Management and Budget for review under the Paperwork Reduction Act. Public burden for the collection
contained within the rulemaking is estimated to average one-half hour per response. This includes the time for reviewing
instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing
the collection of information. Send comments regarding these burden estimates or any other aspect of the data requirements,
including suggestions for reducing this burden, to the Office of Security and Management Support, Room 4513, Bureau
of Export Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230; and to the Office of Information and
Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503 (Attn: Paperwork Reduction Project_0694&hyph;XXXX).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism
assessment under Executive Order 12612. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment are not required to be given for this
rule by section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) or by any other law, under sections 3(a) of the
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has
to be or will be prepared. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, (5 U.S.C. 553), requiring notice of proposed rulemaking,
the opportunity for public participation, and a delay in effective date, are inapplicable because this regulation
involves a military or foreign affairs function of the United States. No other law requires that a notice of proposed
rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment be given for this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, because of the importance of the issues raised by these regulations, this rule is issued in interim form and
comments will be considered in the development of final regulations. Accordingly, the Department encourages interested
persons who wish to comment to do so at the earliest possible time to permit the fullest consideration of their views.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The period for submission of comments will close November 18, 1994. The Department will consider all comments received
before the close of the comment period in developing final regulations. Comments received after the end of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment period will be considered if possible, but their consideration cannot be assured. The Department will not
accept public comments accompanied by a request that a part or all of the material be treated confidentially because
of its business proprietary nature or for any other reason. The Department will return such comments and materials
to the person submitting the comments and will not consider them in the development of final regulations. All public
comments on these regulations will be a matter of public record and will be available for public inspection and copying.
In the interest of accuracy and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completeness, the Department requires comments in written form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Oral comments must be followed by written memoranda, which will also be a matter of public record and will be available
for public review and copying. Communications from agencies of the United States Government or foreign governments
will not be made available for public inspection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public record concerning these regulations will be maintained in the Bureau of Export Administration Freedom
of Information Records Inspection Facility, Room 4525, Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue,
NW., Washington, DC 20230. Records in this facility, including written public comments and memoranda summarizing
the substance of oral communications, may be inspected and copied in accordance with regulations published in Part
4 of Title 15 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Information about the inspection and copying of records at the facility
may be obtained from Edward Lingelbach, Bureau of Export Administration Freedom of Information Officer, at the above
address or by calling (202) 482&hyph;5653.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission today is adopting amendments to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Schedule 14A [17 CFR 240.14a&hyph;101] under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
] (the ``1934 Act'') to add a new item 22 that includes the specific requirements applicable to the proxy statements
of management investment companies (``funds'') registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 [15 U.S.C. 80a&hyph;1

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
] (the ``1940 Act'') and to modify the application of certain items to fund proxy statements. Item 22 replaces rules
20a&hyph;2, 20a&hyph;3, and 20a&hyph;4 under the 1940 Act [17 CFR 270.20a&hyph;2 through 20a&hyph;4], which are
rescinded; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Regulation 14A [17 CFR 240.14a&hyph;1] under section 14(a) of the 1934 Act [15 U.S.C. 78n(a)], Regulation 14C
[17 CFR 240.14c&hyph;1] under section 14(c) of the 1934 Act [15 U.S.C. 78n(c)], Regulation S&hyph;K [17 CFR 229 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
], and related rules to clarify the applicability of certain disclosure requirements to funds and to exempt funds
from certain proxy disclosure requirements; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Rule 30d&hyph;1 [17 CFR 270.30d&hyph;1] and Forms N&hyph;1A [17 CFR 274.11A], N&hyph;2 [17 CFR 274.11a&hyph;1],
and N&hyph;3 [17 CFR 274.11b] to conform certain disclosure requirements to the new proxy statement requirements,
and to make certain other technical and conforming changes; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Form N&hyph;14 [17 CFR 239.23], the form used by funds to register securities issued in connection with business
combination transactions, to require a comparative fee table in the disclosure documents delivered in connection
with such transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendments update fund proxy rules to reflect current matters on which fund shareholders are commonly asked to
vote and are designed to improve the disclosure provided to shareholders and to simplify the preparation of fund proxy
statements.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is adopting revisions to the disclosure requirements for fund proxy statements to update the proxy
disclosure requirements for funds and to simplify the preparation of fund proxies. The amendments consolidate into
a new item 22 in Schedule 14A disclosure requirements previously set forth in rules 20a&hyph;2, 20a&hyph;3, and 20a&hyph;4.
The disclosure requirements of these rules, as modified by the amendments, are incorporated in proposed item 22,
and these rules are rescinded. Item 22 includes: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) in paragraph (a), definitions applicable to item 22 and certain general requirements; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) in paragraph (b), disclosure requirements applicable to solicitations in connection with the election of directors;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) in paragraph (c), disclosure requirements applicable to solicitations in connection with approval of an investment
advisory contract or an amendment thereto; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) in paragraph (d), disclosure requirements applicable to solicitations in connection with a distribution plan
pursuant to rule 12b&hyph;1 under the 1940 Act [17 CFR 270.12b&hyph;1]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Item 22 eliminates certain of the current disclosure requirements concerning matters that are not directly relevant
to solicitations to elect directors or to approve an investment advisory contract. Item 22 includes provisions designed
to improve the disclosure provided to shareholders, including, among other things, a table showing all compensation
paid to directors. This item also specifies information required in fund proxy statements when a fund seeks approval
of a distribution plan under rule 12b&hyph;1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission also is adopting other amendments to the general proxy requirements in Regulation 14A and Schedule
14A, Regulation 14C, and related requirements in Regulation S&hyph;K to accommodate item 22 and to make certain requirements
more appropriate to disclosure for funds.

I. Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 16, 1993, the Commission issued a release proposing amendments to the proxy rules applicable to funds
under the 1940 Act.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed amendments were intended to update the proxy rules to reflect current matters on which fund shareholders
are typically asked to vote and changes in the fund industry since the proxy rules were adopted in 1960. The amendments
also were designed to improve the disclosure provided to shareholders in fund proxy statements by placing greater
emphasis on information that is directly relevant to specific matters submitted to a shareholder vote and by eliminating
disclosure that may not be pertinent to the matters being voted upon and which is, in most cases, available in other
disclosure documents. The Commission received twelve comment letters in response to the proposed amendments.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Commenters generally expressed strong support for the proposed amendments. The Commission is adopting the proposed
amendments with some modifications to reflect the comments received.

A. Item 22 of Schedule 14A: Reorganization of Disclosure Rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is consolidating into a new item 22 to Schedule 14A disclosure requirements set forth in rules 20a-2
and 20a-3.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Previously, funds preparing proxy statements had to refer to rules under both the 1934 Act and the 1940 Act including
Regulation 14A and Schedule 14A under the 1934 Act, Regulation S-K,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and rules 20a-2 and 20a-3 under the 1940 Act. Commenters strongly supported the consolidation of proxy disclosure
requirements in item 22.

These rules are rescinded. Rule 20a-4, which requires a financial data schedule to accompany a proxy filed in connection
with certain transactions if the proxy is filed electronically, is also rescinded and incorporated in subparagraph
(a)(4) of Item 22. The other items in Schedule 14A continue to be applicable, as appropriate, to fund proxy statements.
Schedule 14A includes provisions governing the form and content of all proxy statements. It requires, among other
things, information concerning: (i) the date, time, and place of the meeting of shareholders (item 1); (ii) proposals
to amend an issuer's charter, by-laws or other corporate documents (item 19); and (iii) voting tabulation procedures
(item 21).

The Commission has adopted minor technical amendments to rule 20a-1 [17 CFR 270.20a-1], the rule that implements
the Commission's authority with respect to proxies under section 20(a) of the 1940 Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-20(a)], to delete
references to rules 20a-2 and 20a-3 and to add references to, among other things, Regulation 14A and Schedule 14A.
In addition, the filing fee requirement in rule 20a-1(c) [17 CFR 270.20a-1(c)] has been moved to subparagraph (a)(2)
of item 22.

1. Proxy Statement Format; Summary Table 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Item 22, as proposed, included a new requirement concerning the format for disclosure when one proxy statement solicits
shareholder votes for more than one fund or multiple portfolios of series investment companies (``series funds'').
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
7
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This manner of solicitation, while more efficient and less costly, may be confusing to shareholders. Therefore,
to assist shareholders in identifying proposals applicable to their fund or portfolio, the Commission proposed
to require a fund to include a table at the beginning of the proxy statement that summarizes each proposal and indicates
which fund or series shareholders are being requested to approve each proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
A series fund is a fund comprised of two or more portfolios, each of which has a distinct investment objective with assets
specifically allocated to that portfolio; investors' interests in such a fund are limited to those portfolios in
which they invest. Each portfolio operates for many purposes like a separate fund, although the portfolios are all
part of the same business entity with one board of directors. Series funds are specifically permitted under section
18(f)(2) of the 1940 Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-18(f)(2)].

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters opposed the proposed tabular format, asserting that funds should have the flexibility to present
the information in other formats. The Commission believes that the tabular format affords ample flexibility for
funds to present the information they believe is important, while providing the advantages of a uniform format. The
Commission is adopting the proposed item with one change from the proposal:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
8
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the summary table requirement, as adopted, also applies to proxy statements for multiple class funds containing
multiple proposals affecting different classes.

Subparagraph (a)(3)(ii) of item 22. The table would not be required if the proxy statement solicits a vote or votes
on the same proposal or proposals from all fund or series shareholders. To assure that shareholders are not confused
in casting their vote, a separate proxy card is required for each fund, portfolio, or class.

Multiple class funds issue more than one class of securities, with each class typically subject to a different distribution
arrangement, but representing interests in the same portfolio of investments. Currently, funds must obtain exemptive
orders to implement these type of arrangements. The Commission recently proposed rule and form amendments that would
permit a fund to issue multiple classes of securities without the need for an exemptive order. Investment Company
Act Rel. No. 19955 (Dec. 16, 1993) [58 FR 68074 (Dec. 23, 1993)].

2. Definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission proposed in paragraph (a) of item 22 definitions for certain terms used in item 22. The definitions
are adopted substantially as proposed with some modifications to reflect comments on the scope of two of the definitions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, the definition of ``fund complex'' has been modified. The proposed amendments would require disclosure of
certain information if a fund director serves as director of more than one fund in a ``fund complex,'' including, for
example, the aggregate compensation paid to a director who serves on a number of boards in a fund complex.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As proposed, item 22(a) defined a ``fund complex'' as two or more funds with a common investment adviser (or which have
advisers that are affiliates) or, with respect to open-end funds, a common principal underwriter. The Proposing
Release requested comment on whether the definition should include groups of funds with common administrators.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission believes it is important to define fund complex in a manner that will result in disclosure of information
about directors (particularly concerning compensation) serving on the boards of related funds. As some commenters
pointed out, many funds may have common principal underwriters or administrators that solely provide services to
the fund but are otherwise not associated with the fund, and therefore would not be commonly understood to be part of
a group of related funds. Other similar definitions of ``group'' or ``family'' of investment companies address this
issue by specifying that the funds hold themselves out to investors as related companies for the purposes of investment
and investor services, in addition to sharing a principal underwriter.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
11
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission has decided to define fund complex as two or more funds that hold themselves out to investors as related
companies or that have a common investment adviser.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
12
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission believes the information about directors on the boards of funds that are marketed to investors as related
funds (regardless of whether they have a common principal underwriter or administrator) is important to shareholders.
In addition, the Commission believes that an investment adviser typically has such an important role in a fund's activities
that the definition of fund complex should include funds with common investment advisers regardless of whether the
funds hold themselves out as related companies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, as suggested by several commenters, the Commission has deleted the definition of ``distributor.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
13
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This definition was intended to identify persons involved in distributing fund shares for purposes of other disclosure
items that are designed to elicit disclosure about relationships between fund directors (who vote on Rule 12b&hyph;1
Plans) and persons involved in distributing fund shares that could involve conflicts of interest. Commenters argued
that, because many persons or firms may provide distribution services to a fund, the definition would likely result
in the disclosure of large amounts of information much of which would be immaterial because many of the persons involved
have a minor role in the distribution of fund shares. The Commission has eliminated the definition and has modified
the disclosure concerning Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plans to require information concerning only those persons receiving
significant payments from the fund for distribution services.

3. Comparative Fee Table 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As proposed, item 22(a) would require fund proxy statements seeking approval of proposals that would increase fees
or expenses, directly or indirectly, to include a comparative fee table showing the amount of fees and expenses currently
paid by fund shareholders and the amount of fees and expenses shareholders would have paid if the matter being voted
on had been in effect. Some commenters suggested that the fee table requirement be combined with a materiality limitation,
either for indirect fee increases or for increases in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
any 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
fees, direct or indirect. The Commission believes that shareholders should see the effects of any increases in fees.
Moreover, limiting the requirement to material increases in fees would necessarily introduce more variability,
and possibly uncertainty, into a determination of when the requirement is applicable. Therefore, the Commission
is adopting the fee table requirement as proposed.

15
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Subparagraph (a)(3)(iv) of item 22. The comparative fee table would be required if any of the fee categories in the
fee table would be increased (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 Management Fees, 12b&hyph;1 Fees, Other Expenses) regardless of whether total expenses would be increased, but
would not be required if a proposal's effect on expenses is speculative. A sample fee table is attached as an appendix
to this release. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission also proposed to amend Form N&hyph;14, the form used by funds to register securities issued in certain
investment company merger transactions, to require a comparative fee table for the combined fund. Commenters supported
the addition of the comparative fee table to Form N&hyph;14, and the Commission is adopting the amendments as proposed.
Paragraph (a) of item 3 of Form N&hyph;14.

4. Voting Results 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As proposed, item 22(a) would include a requirement that a fund state in the proxy statement whether it intends to inform
shareholders of the voting results in a shareholder report or other document transmitted to shareholders. Some commenters
had reservations about the voting results statement because, among other things, their experience did not suggest
that shareholders had a significant interest in the information. In addition, commenters objected to a requirement
for a negative statement if the fund does not plan to provide voting results in a subsequent shareholder report. In
lieu of the proposed disclosure requirement, the Commission is adopting an express requirement that funds report
voting results in the fund's next annual or semi-annual report. The Commission is amending rule 30d&hyph;1 to require
a report of voting results in the annual or semi-annual report to shareholders. The Commission believes that this
approach will assure that voting result information is available to shareholders and eliminate any necessity for
funds to make a negative statement regarding the availability of voting results in proxy statements.

The Commission proposed a number of revisions to the proxy disclosure requirements relating to the election of directors,
primarily to focus the requirements on information directly relevant to the qualifications, background, and relationships
of directors and to eliminate information that is not pertinent to the election of directors. The proposed revisions
included eliminating detailed disclosure concerning the investment adviser (including a certified balance sheet
of the adviser),

list, the proxy statement identify the fund complex and the number of directorships. Commenters generally supported
this revision to the disclosure of other directorships, and the Commission is adopting the modification as proposed.

D. Management Compensation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Fund proxy statements are required to include information about the compensation of fund directors and officers
in connection with the election of directors or proposals seeking shareholder approval of benefit plans in which
directors or officers will participate. These requirements have been included in item 8 of Schedule 14A, which references
Regulation S&hyph;K and fund registration statement forms.

 The Commission proposed amendments to consolidate the disclosure requirements for management compensation paid
by funds to directors and officers in paragraph (b) of item 22, to reformat the requirements, and to expand the information
provided for directors, in particular, adding disclosure of the aggregate compensation of directors who serve on
the board of more than one fund in a fund complex.

The Commission also proposed to amend fund registration statements to require a statement in the prospectus that
information about director and officer compensation and the background of fund management is available in the Statement
of Additional Information (``SAI''). Upon consideration of the comments, the Commission believes the general statement
in the prospectus about the availability of information in the SAI is sufficient notice for shareholders and has not
included this requirement in the final rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most of these changes were generally supported by the commenters. Commenters, however, were evenly divided on the
proposed disclosure of aggregate fund compensation paid to directors. The aggregate compensation disclosure was
proposed in recognition that directors often receive substantial annual fees for their service on a number of boards
in a fund complex, and that disclosure of only the compensation they receive from a single fund does not provide a complete
picture of director compensation. Commenters opposed to the disclosure asserted, among other things, that disclosure
of aggregate compensation could overshadow some of the benefits associated with directors serving on a number of
fund boards (such as development of expertise in fund issues and cost-savings) or ignore the necessity of paying adequate
compensation to attract well-qualified directors. Several commenters noted that because directors determine
their level of compensation, which is paid by the fund, the compensation received from other related funds is not indicative
of a conflict of interest or lack of independence from the investment adviser. Whether or not they supported disclosure
of aggregate fund complex compensation, many of the commenters specifically objected to what they considered to
be implications in the Proposing Release that compensation could compromise a director's independence or that directors
are not responsibly discharging their statutory and regulatory role. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission believes that the nature and amount of a director's aggregate compensation from a fund complex is useful
information that funds should provide to shareholders. Whether the amount of compensation affects a director's
independence is only one of many possible inferences a shareholder may draw from compensation information.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
26
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Another inference may be that the fund is overpaying directors; another may be that the fund is not obtaining the best
quality directors because they are underpaid; and still another inference may be that the amount of compensation
is commensurate with the level of expertise, oversight, and effort that directors provide to the fund. The Commission
believes that the possibility that unwarranted inferences may result from the disclosure of compensation information
is not an appropriate basis to eliminate a requirement for information about directors that will improve shareholders'
understanding of the compensation paid to directors and that is readily available to funds.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
27
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Therefore, the Commission is adopting the revised compensation disclosure requirements as proposed.

The Commission believes that the receipt of a substantial amount of compensation from a fund complex is not necessarily
determinative of the director's independence. The amount of compensation received, however, could be one factor
to be considered in evaluating the independence of a fund director from fund management.

Subparagraph (b)(6) of item 22. Paragraph (ii) of subparagraph (b)(6) has been revised to make it clear that the material
terms of compensation arrangements with directors other than the typical directors' fees disclosed in the compensation
table, including, for example, consulting arrangements, must be described. Such arrangements, however, could
raise the issue of whether a director has a material business or professional relationship with the fund and could
be found to be an ``interested'' director under section 2(a)(19)(A)(vi) of the 1940 Act [15 U.S.C. 80a&hyph;2(a)(19)(A)(vi)].

The compensation disclosure required for fund officers would remain the same under the proposed amendments except
for minor revisions. Because most funds are externally managed, fund executive officers generally do not have formal
management roles and receive no compensation from the fund. As currently required, however, compensation received
by the three highest paid executive officers having aggregate compensation from a fund (but not the fund complex)
exceeding $60,000 would have to be disclosed in the compensation table. To make the disclosure of management compensation
uniform, the compensation disclosure required to appear in the SAI portion of a fund's registration statement is
amended to be consistent with item 22. Forms N&hyph;1A (item 14), N&hyph;2 (item 18), and N&hyph;3 (item 20).

The Commission also is adopting, as proposed, an additional disclosure requirement concerning investment advisory
fees. If a change in the investment advisory fee is sought, subparagraph (c)(9) of item 22 requires disclosure of the
aggregate amount of the investment adviser's fee for the last year, the amount the adviser would have received had
the proposed fee been in effect, and the percentage amount of the proposed increase.

The Commission is eliminating some of the requirements that funds provide information about brokerage practices
because the requirements have not provided investors with information that is helpful in making a decision whether
to vote for or against an investment advisory contract. The Commission continues to be concerned about fund brokerage
practices. Recently, the Commission proposed amendments to Form N&hyph;1A that, if adopted, would require certain
expenses paid by directed brokerage to be treated as an expense in fund financial statements and the fee table, and
would require average brokerage commission rates to be disclosed in the Financial Highlights Table in fund prospectuses.

2. Material Factor Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission proposed to require a discussion of material factors considered by the board of directors in recommending
that fund shareholders approve an investment advisory contract. As proposed, the item enumerated certain material
factors that might be included in the discussion. Several commenters objected to enumerated material factors arguing
that such a requirement would lead to formalistic and ``boiler plate'' disclosure and may tend to oversimplify the
board's evaluation process. The Commission believes that the material factors discussion should reflect the board
of directors' evaluation of the investment advisory contract and shares commenters' concern that enumeration of
factors might lead to ``boiler plate'' disclosure.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
37
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Therefore, the Commission has decided not to include a list of material factors in the requirement for a discussion
of the recommended investment advisory contract.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission proposed to amend the proxy rules to set forth certain disclosure requirements for proxy statements
seeking approval of a Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan and plan amendments.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
39
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 These proposed requirements reflected, in many respects, disclosure currently made in proxy statements. Commenters
generally supported the proposed express disclosure requirements for Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plans, and the Commission
is adopting item 22(d) substantially as proposed.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
40
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Item 22(d) requires: (i) a description of the proposed action and the reasons shareholders are being requested to
vote on adoption (or amendment) of a Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan; (ii) disclosure of material differences between the proposed
and the current Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan; (iii) disclosure about distribution expenses under the plan paid by the fund
during the last fiscal year to the fund's investment adviser, principal underwriter, administrator, or any of their
affiliated persons, and to persons receiving 10% or more of the fund's aggregate distribution fees; and (iv) disclosure
about the factors the board of directors considered in recommending adoption of (or amendment to) the Rule 12b&hyph;1
Plan.

that would materially increase the amount spent for distribution.

G. Annual Report Delivery Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Rule 14a&hyph;3(b) [17 CFR 240.14a&hyph;3(b)] under the 1934 Act requires that, when directors are to be elected
at an annual or special shareholder meeting, registrants, including funds, furnish each person solicited with a
proxy statement that is accompanied or preceded by an annual report to shareholders. Most non-investment company
registrants hold annual meetings to elect directors, and, in many cases, the annual report delivery requirement
under rule 14a&hyph;3(b) is the only requirement that shareholders receive an annual report. Funds, on the other
hand, are subject to express annual (and semi-annual) shareholder reporting requirements under section 30(d) of
the 1940 Act [15 U.S.C. 80a&hyph;29(d)] and rule 30d&hyph;1, regardless of whether they hold annual meetings, and
fund shareholder meetings may not coincide with the mailing of the annual shareholder report.
<FOOTCITE>42</FOOTCITE>
 To clarify the annual report delivery requirements for funds, the Commission proposed to amend rule 14a&hyph;3(b)
to set forth the conditions under which a fund's annual report previously transmitted to shareholders as required
under rule 30d&hyph;1 would satisfy the rule.
<FOOTCITE>43</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission requested comment on other alternatives for the annual report delivery requirement, including whether
it might be appropriate to eliminate the proxy annual report requirement for funds in light of the reports required
to be transmitted to shareholders semi-annually under rule 30d&hyph;1.

Funds generally are not required under state law or the 1940 Act to hold annual shareholder meetings. Funds schedule
shareholder meetings as necessary to elect directors, to approve investment advisory contracts or Rule 12b&hyph;1
Plans, or to vote on other matters requiring shareholder approval.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
As proposed, an annual report transmitted to shareholders two months before the date of the proxy statement would
satisfy the delivery requirements of rule 14a&hyph;3(b). Where more than two months has elapsed, the rule 14a&hyph;3(b)
annual report delivery requirement would be satisfied if: (i) the fund mails the proxy statement at least 30 days prior
to the meeting; (ii) the proxy statement includes a prominent statement that the most recent annual report and any
subsequent semi-annual report will be delivered to shareholders, upon written or oral request, without charge;
and (iii) if requested by a shareholder, the annual report and, if available, the semi-annual report is transmitted
within two business days of the request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters supported the proposed clarification of the annual report delivery requirement. Other commenters,
however, urged the Commission to eliminate the requirement and to substitute a requirement that the proxy statement
include a legend advising shareholders that an annual report is available upon request. These commenters argued
that the shareholder reporting requirements of the 1940 Act make the proxy annual report requirement superfluous.
Commenters also noted that the primary effect of the annual report requirement is to impose restrictions on holding
shareholder meetings because meetings can not be scheduled when the annual report for the preceding fiscal year is
not yet available after the end of the fiscal year. In some cases, a fund complex may wish to make a combined proxy mailing
for several funds to reduce the expense of the proxy solicitation; however, a joint proxy statement may be precluded
if some of the funds have different fiscal years for which the annual report is not available.
<FOOTCITE>44</FOOTCITE>
 These commenters argued that the cost of mailing an annual report with the proxy statement to new shareholders who
have not received an annual report can be substantial, and these expenses are borne by the fund's shareholders.

The Commission agrees that the costs imposed on funds and their shareholders outweigh the benefits of requiring that
annual reports accompany a proxy statement. At the time of a proxy solicitation, shareholders who have recently invested
in a fund will have received a current prospectus and other shareholders will have received either an annual or semi-annual
report within six months of receiving the proxy statement. In addition, most funds transmit to shareholders quarterly
account statements providing information about fund performance. In contrast with the timeliness of information
provided under the 1940 Act's reporting regime, rule 14a&hyph;3(b) requires delivery of a fund annual report that
may be, in some cases, almost twelve months old. Thus, this requirement has the unintended and anomalous effect of
requiring delivery of an annual report the information in which may have been superseded by information in a more recent
semi-annual report. Moreover, as applied, the current requirements impose significant restraints on the timing
of shareholder meetings and may add substantial costs to holding meetings when, for example, accountants must perform
an audit on an expedited basis. Therefore, the Commission is revising rule 14a&hyph;3(b) to eliminate the annual
report delivery requirement for funds.

Paragraph (4) of rule 14a&hyph;3(b) requires the annual report to include information concerning changes in and

[17 CFR 229.304]. The Commission is preserving this requirement for funds by amending the shareholder report financial
statement requirements set forth in rule 30d&hyph;1 by reference to the applicable item in the registration statement
forms (new instruction 4(iv) of item 23 of Form N&hyph;1A; new instruction 4(c) of item 23 of Form N&hyph;2; and new

H. Other Matters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is adopting two other amendments to the general proxy provisions. First, the Commission is amending
rule 14a&hyph;3(e)(2) [17 CFR 240.14a&hyph;3(e)(2)], which relieves funds of the obligation to deliver proxy and
other soliciting materials to shareholders whose dividend payments are returned as undeliverable, to relieve funds
(and other registrants) of the delivery obligation when dividend reinvestment confirmations are returned as undeliverable.
Second, the Commission is amending Item 3 of Schedule 14A, which requires a description of appraisal or similar rights
under state law applicable to any matter being acted upon (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
mergers and other fundamental corporate transactions), to make it expressly inapplicable to open-end funds.
<FOOTCITE>47</FOOTCITE>
 The 1940 Act, which requires open-end funds to redeem their securities at net asset value,
<FOOTCITE>48</FOOTCITE>
 supersedes state law appraisal rights.

I. Date of Effectiveness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The new amendments to the proxy rules are effective on November 23, 1994. Funds may file, at their option, proxy statements
prepared in accordance with the new rules on or after the effective date. Funds must comply with the new rules for all
proxy statements filed on or after January 23, 1995. During the transition period between the effective date and the
compliance date, funds should state in the cover letter submitting the proxy statement whether the proxy statement
is prepared using the new rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Cost/Benefit of the Proposals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendments to the proxy rules, as adopted, are intended to improve the disclosure provided to fund shareholders
in proxy statements. The amendments are not expected to impose additional burdens on funds. The amendments eliminate
a substantial amount of ``boiler plate'' disclosure regarding matters that may not be relevant to shareholders.
The additional information required by the amendments is readily available, and the elimination of the annual report
requirement in connection with the proxy statement should provide funds with greater flexibility in scheduling
shareholder meetings and reduce related expenses.

 The Secretary amends the final Standards, Criteria, and Procedures under the Federal Direct Student Loan (Direct
Loan) Program to add the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control numbers to certain sections of the Standards,
Criteria, and Procedures. Those sections contain information collection requirements approved by OMB. The Secretary
takes this action to inform the public that these requirements have been approved, and therefore affected parties
must comply with them.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On July 1, 1994, final Standards, Criteria, and Procedures were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 governing the repayment and consolidation of loans under the Federal Direct Student Loan (Direct Loan) Program in
the academic year beginning July 1, 1994 (59 FR 34278). Compliance with information collection requirements in 34
CFR 685.209, 685.213, 685.214, and 685.215 was delayed until those requirements were approved by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1980. On September 23, 1994 OMB approved those information collection requirements under that Act;
therefore affected parties must now comply with those requirements.

Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 431(b)(2)(A) of the General Education Provisions Act (20 U.S.C. 1232(b)(2)(A)) and the
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), it is the practice of the Secretary to offer interested parties the opportunity
to comment on proposed regulations. However, the publication of OMB control numbers is purely technical and does
not establish substantive policy. Therefore, the Secretary has determined under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) that proposed
rulemaking is unnecessary and contrary to the public interest and that a delayed effective date is not required under
5 U.S.C 553(d)(3).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On November 4, 1992, the Commonwealth of Virginia submitted a formal revision to its State Implementation Plan (SIP).
The SIP revision consists of amendments to Virginia's definition of the term volatile organic compound (VOC), administrative
changes to Virginia's lists of emission control areas, and the addition of a new emission statement regulation. The
portion of Virginia's November 4, 1992 SIP revision submittal pertaining to emission statements is the subject of
a separate rulemaking action.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 15, 1990, amendments to the 1977 Clean Air Act were enacted. Under the amended Act, EPA and the States were
required to review the designation of areas and to redesignate areas as nonattainment for ozone if the air quality
data from 1987, 1988, and 1989, indicated that the area was violating the ozone standard. On November 6, 1991, and November
30, 1992, EPA promulgated designations pursuant to the amended Act, which expanded the boundaries of the Washington,
DC, Richmond, and Hampton Roads nonattainment areas. 56 FR 56694 and 57 FR 56762. The Washington, DC nonattainment
area was extended to include Stafford County; the Richmond nonattainment area was expanded to include Charles City
County, Colonial Heights County, Hanover County, and Hopewell County; and the Hampton Roads nonattainment area
was expanded to include James City County, York County, Poquoson County, and Williamsburg City.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following is EPA's evaluation of the SIP revisions submitted by the Commonwealth of Virginia. Detailed descriptions
of the amendments addressed in this document, and EPA's evaluation of the amendments, are contained in the technical
support document (TSD) prepared for this revision. Copies of the TSD are available from the EPA Regional office listed
in the

Commonwealth's Submittal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Section 120&hyph;01&hyph;02 has been amended to revise the definition of the term volatile organic compound
(VOC) to be consistent with EPA's definition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Appendix P, which contained a list of VOC emission control areas, has been amended to include a list of emission
control areas for oxides of nitrogen (NO

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emission control areas correspond to the ozone nonattainment designations which EPA issued in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 6, 1991, and November 30, 1992. 56 FR 56694 and 57 FR 56762.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The list of VOC emission control areas in appendix P was revised to correspond to the ozone nonattainment area designations
which EPA issued in the

EPA's Evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These amendments are administrative in nature, and will have no adverse effect on air quality. These amendments are
consistent with EPA requirements, and consequently serve to strengthen the Virginia SIP. Therefore, they are approvable
as a revision to the Virginia SIP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is approving this SIP revision without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment
and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 publication, EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be filed. This action
will become effective December 19, 1994 unless, by November 18, 1994, adverse or critical comments are received.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If EPA receives such comments, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a subsequent
notice that will withdraw the final action. All public comments received will then be addressed in a subsequent final
rule based on this action serving as a proposed rule. EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action.
Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If no such comments are received, the
public is advised that this action will be effective on December 19, 1994.

Final Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is approving amendments to Virginia's definition for the term VOC and lists of VOC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emission control areas, section 120&hyph;01&hyph;02 and appendix P, respectively, as a revision to the Virginia
SIP. The Commonwealth of Virginia submitted these amendments to EPA as a SIP revision on November 4, 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements but simply
approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose
any new requirements, the Administrator certifies that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities
affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a flexibility
analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Clean Air Act forbids
EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

This action has been classified as a Table 2 action for signature by the Regional Administrator under the procedures
published in the

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables.
On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from
the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The EPA has submitted a request for
a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules
on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866, which superseded Executive Order
12291 on September 30, 1993.

Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by December 19, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by
the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor
does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section
307(b)(2)).

In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of June 6, 1991 (56 FR 25993), the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) issued an interim rule to revise the regulations
for the CCC Export Credit Guarantee Program (GSM&hyph;102) and the CCC Intermediate Export Credit Guarantee Program
(GSM&hyph;103) administered by FAS, USDA on behalf of CCC, pursuant to program regulations codified at 7 CFR Part
1493 and through the issuance of ``Program Announcements'' and ``Notices to Participants'' that are consistent
with, and in addition to, these program regulations. The interim rule incorporated or withdrew all previously outstanding
operational requirements announced by FAS/USDA through Notices to Participants. The interim rule also incorporated
requirements established by the 1990 Act. Finally, the interim rule clarified several provisions previously contained
in 7 CFR Part 1493 to promote more efficient administration of the GSM&hyph;102 and GSM&hyph;103 programs. The deadline
for comments on the interim rule was August 5, 1991. Comments were received from five U.S. exporters (one exporter
submitted two separate responses), three producer associations, two U.S. financial institutions, one U.S. export
trade association, and one U.S. Government agency. These thirteen parties made approximately 66 separate and significant
comments regarding either the interim rule or the policy issues and the impact of policies involved in administering
the GSM&hyph;102 and GSM&hyph;103 programs.

General Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter disagreed with CCC's statement that it has been determined that this rule will not result in ``significant
adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation or the ability of United States-based
enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.'' This respondent shared
that while the interim rule contained some improvements, some of the changes would restrict the competitiveness
of, and be detrimental to, the sale of U.S. goods. The commenter argued that the interim rule was an overreaction resulting
from the Iraqi default on GSM&hyph;102/103 guaranteed obligations. The commenter acknowledged that the U.S. Government
must monitor the programs to prevent abuse but contended that, in general, free market conditions should prevail.
While CCC agrees that the GSM&hyph;102/103 programs should avoid unduly restricting normal commercial practices,
the Department has been mandated by Congress to implement measures to guard against program abuse. It is the Department's
intention to adopt necessary program safeguards while still enhancing the ability of U.S. exporters to compete in
foreign markets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four commenters supported and commended the USDA's efforts to catalogue and codify many of the operational features
of the programs, to assure that the regulations are being met, and to create more accountability within the programs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four other commenters felt that the intention of the interim rule to ``*&blank;*&blank;* simplify material, enhance
clarity, eliminate duplication and facilitate their use *&blank;*&blank;*'' has not been met. These commenters
stated that the interim rule is complicated, unclear at some points, and unnecessarily duplicative. The commenter
argued and that, more than ever, the regulations contain burdensome regulatory features which could constrain the
programs' effectiveness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter felt that the interests of program simplification have been abandoned and that undue burdens are being
placed on participants to protect the programs from a few perceived manipulations. This commenter suggested that
the program is not ``user friendly'' when administrators focus only on protecting the programs from all risk, or on
shifting all risk to the exporter or buyer. Another respondent felt that the lack of USDA guidance on pertinent issues
is not only frustrating, but may have also compromised the strengths of the U.S. agricultural system. CCC agrees that
the interim rule contains regulatory features that place additional burdens on program participants, such as added
certification statements, requirements to maintain arrival documentation, and longer retention time on transaction
records. Although such requirements may compare unfavorably with the simplicity of the prior regulations, these
requirements are mandated by the 1990 Act. On the other hand, CCC has also made changes that consolidate program requirements.
For example, policy and additional program requirements previously contained in a number of Notices to Participants
were incorporated into the interim rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Five commenters felt that the revised regulations are a response to criticism of the GSM&hyph;102/103 programs and
pressure on program administration brought on by prior audits and investigations by the General Accounting Office
and USDA's Office of the Inspector General. Another commenter stated that since auditors do not create exports for
the U.S. economy and have no responsibility for market development there is a need to re-establish teamwork between
FAS and the export community to resolve key issues. One commenter felt the intent of the 1990 Farm Bill was to streamline
program procedures, but, in actuality, the programs are more bureaucratic than ever. This same commenter felt that
the USDA has forgotten that the GSM&hyph;102/103 programs are commercial programs, that the programs must reflect
commercial realities, and that recent studies and audits have not focused on the commercial and competitive viability
of the GSM&hyph;102/103. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CCC acknowledges these concerns. In addressing audit and investigation reports on its commercial export programs,
CCC has attempted to put in perspective the relatively low incidence of program violations in the programs. However,
given that many of the requirements of the interim rule aimed at preventing program abuses were mandated by the 1990
Act, CCC cannot concur that the primary legislative intent was to ``streamline procedures.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three respondents recommended that the interim rule be revised to allow financial institutions to use the commercial
banking practice of securitization as a financing technique for CCC-guaranteed credits. Securitization would
involve the packaging of such credits by a U.S. financial institution for sale to third parties as U.S.-government
guaranteed securities. It is asserted that securitization would expand sources, and perhaps reduce the cost, of
financing for CCC-guaranteed credits. However, respondents point out that certain program regulations and CCC
policies now make securitization infeasible. For example, regulations require that the guarantee holder who has
experienced a default and filed a claim with CCC must turn all recoveries ``from any source whatsoever'' over to CCC
for pro rata sharing (&sect;1493.130(b)(1)). This provision is intended to ensure that the U.S. party financing
the transaction always remains at risk for the portion of the credit and interest not guaranteed by CCC. Generally,
this policy is seen as incompatible with the issuance of 100% U.S. Government-guaranteed securities since any collateral
put up by the foreign borrower to cover the portion not guaranteed by CCC could be subject to pro-rata sharing with CCC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, U.S. banks point out that the unwillingness of CCC to pre-approve export and other documents that must
be submitted to support a claim on CCC in the event of default makes it impossible to issue high grade securities based
on CCC-guaranteed credits. Without pre-approval, such securities could not be marketed with absolute assurance
that claims on CCC for defaults on the underlying credits would be found in good order and honored. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CCC has considered these and other proposals for securitization of CCC-guaranteed credits. However, CCC remains
of the view that, although the degree of risk-sharing may be adapted to meet program objectives, requiring risk-sharing
with the holder of the guarantee (normally a U.S. bank) is an essential feature of the GSM&hyph;102/103 programs.
It forces the private sector to engage in risk assessment relating to individual transactions, and thereby supplements
the risk assessment done by CCC prior to announcing export credit guarantee programs for specific countries. Removing
this requirement would also reduce the incentive banks now have to press for recovery of late payments from foreign
banks rather than claiming immediately on CCC. CCC does not have the resources that would be required to pre-approve
documents and to effectively manage the increase in claims and follow-up recovery efforts that would go hand-in-hand
with changing the specified provisions of the GSM&hyph;102/103 regulations to facilitate securitization. For
these reasons, CCC is not prepared at this time to propose program changes to facilitate securitization of its credit
guarantees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments were received regarding republishing the rule. One respondent suggested that the USDA republish the
regulations on a routine basis, requesting public comments, to insure that improvements in the programs may be continually
advocated and effected. Another commenter suggested a redraft of areas of greatest controversy and republication
with request for comments. CCC agrees that the GSM&hyph;102/103 program regulations are important and should be
reviewed periodically. It is CCC's policy to do this. However, publication of an additional interim rule at this time
would further delay implementation of a final rule which is needed to establish a basic permanent framework for the
programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter felt that the delays in the administrative process increase exporter risks and costs and inhibit the
programs' effectiveness. This respondent recommended that the regulations include absolute deadlines governing
the USDA's performance of administrative functions. CCC recognizes that administrative delays in processing applications
and issuing guarantees may result in additional costs and risks to exporters, and CCC is, therefore, committed to
expediting existing administrative procedures. However, it is not feasible to establish absolute time-frames
for actions because many administrative delays may be due to the failure of participants to provide all required information,
or are the unavoidable consequence of increased program activity during specific time periods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One respondent recommended that a special trade advisory committee be established to address controversial provisions
of program regulations. The commenter called on the Agricultural Policy Advisory Committee (APAC) and the Agricultural
Technical Advisory Committee (ATAC) to devote attention to these programs. CCC disagrees that a special trade advisory
committee is warranted. Considerable debate was aired when Congress developed the 1990 Act which mandated changes
to the GSM&hyph;102/103 programs. The Department also has considerable experience in administering credit and
credit guarantee programs, and has a continuing dialogue with private sector program participants on administrative
and other program policies. CCC believes that the rulemaking process should remain the primary vehicle for obtaining
views of interested parties. This process gives an equal opportunity to all parties, is part of the public record,
and is required by law. The APAC and ATAC could consider GSM&hyph;102/103 issues if their members so choose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter suggested that solutions to some of the problems are simply to modify the regulations, but other problems
require a comprehensive policy review by USDA policy officials. Another commenter supported a special credit facility
separate from the regular GSM&hyph;102/103 programs for the former Republics of the Soviet Union. These comments,
by their own admission, address concerns outside the content of the program regulations and therefore, are not considered
in this final rule.

The numbering system of the final rule differs somewhat from that of the interim rule. Some sections were added, some
were deleted. For the purposes of this discussion, the numbering system of the final rule will be used, except where
otherwise indicated. In addition to changes resulting from comments from interested parties, some additional changes
in language have been incorporated into the final rule for the purpose of clarification of specific provisions. These
changes are minor and not of a substantive nature.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter felt that, because of problems which previously impeded the timely provision of the credits to the republics
of the former Soviet Union, USDA needs to elaborate its ``creditworthiness'' criteria and should consider revising
current restrictions and limits on credit that make it difficult for many debt-burdened countries to participate
in the program. CCC notes that the 1990 Act prohibits export credit guarantees from being used ``for foreign aid, foreign
policy, or debt rescheduling purposes'' and instructs that CCC ``shall not make credit guarantees available in connection
with sales of agricultural commodities to any country that the Secretary determines cannot adequately service the
debt associated with such sale.'' Under this legislative mandate, CCC believes that the criteria of &sect;1493.4
cannot be changed in ways to meet the objective suggested by the commenter.

Eight respondents commented on &sect;1493.20(f), Discounts and Allowances. All comments, in one way or another,
recommended changes to this section to permit discounts and allowances that are consistent with customary commercial
trade practices. The commenters suggested specifically excluding from the definition of discounts and allowances:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Cash payments, under the terms of the export sales contract, made by the exporter to the financing institution
which reduce the amount financed and are notified to CCC as amendments to port value or export value as appropriate;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Credits against the sales price, under the terms of the export sales contract, which reduce the amount of CCC coverage
and are notified to CCC as amendments to the port value and exported value, as appropriate; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Cash payments by the exporter to third parties for demurrage, detention and overage insurance premiums; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Adjustments for destination weights in cotton sales. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The payments or credits described in comments (1) and (2) above, are discounts or allowances to the importer; however,
if properly reported to CCC and the amount of CCC's coverage consequently reduced, no program violation is involved.
CCC has, therefore, determined not to include these suggested exemptions in 1493.20(f). Items (3) and (4) are addressed
below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter recommended that the definition of discounts and allowances should be revised to delete reference
to demurrage and detention settlements. The commenter stated that demurrage and detention settlements are normal
costs which may be incurred in an export sales transaction. When settlement funds are paid to an importer, the importer
is only acting as an intermediary in making these payments to a third party, i.e., the shipping line. Thus the financial
transaction between exporter and importer is unaffected. Similarly, payments of over-age insurance premiums to
underwriters because of an exporter's inability to otherwise charter a vessel of required specifications should
not be considered a discount or allowance to the importer. CCC concurs with these comments and has therefore, deleted
reference to demurrage and detention in the definition of discounts and allowances in this final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two respondents felt that there is a contradiction in the USDA's interpretation of &sect;1493.20(f). When a weight
increase occurs at destination, CCC makes no provision for amending the exported value to increase coverage. However,
when destination weights decrease, any adjustment by the exporter in favor of the importer is considered by CCC as
a discount or allowance and CCC requires that the value of the guarantee be correspondingly reduced. The respondents
argue that there should be consistent treatment in both cases, and that as long as there is coverage available from
the country line, adjustments to exported value should be made for both weight increases or decreases. CCC disagrees.
To guard against potential program abuse, CCC has instituted a system to price review all transactions for which GSM&hyph;102/103
guarantees are sought. The purpose of the price review is to insure that the sales price of the transaction being guaranteed
falls within a reasonable and acceptable price range given market conditions in existence at the time of the sale.
CCC's price review compares the particular price with representative prices at a U.S. export position, and is, therefore,
based upon U.S. export weight and grade determinations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, determining the port value and guaranteed value of the transaction, and CCC's contingent liablility under
the guarantee, on the basis of destination weights and grades would undermine the effectiveness of and could potentially
invalidate, the price review process. CCC recognizes that, in certain markets, the use of destination weights and
grades is a normal commercial term of contract and, therefore, will issue guarantees in connection with such transactions
to facilitate the export trade. However, since CCC is not able to conduct price reviews on the basis of destination
weights and grades (because the determination of destination weights and grades necessarily occurs only after the
commodities have arrived at the port of destination and, therefore, long after the application for GSM&hyph;102/103
coverage has been approved), exporters will have to bear the varied risks involved with contracting on that basis.
Those risks include the possibility that a decrease in weight or grade between export and destination will result
in an adjustment or settlement in favor of the importer; or that an increase will result in an adjustment or settlement
in favor of the exporter. In the former case, the adjustment in favor of the importer would qualify as a ``discount or
allowance'' within the meaning of &sect;1493.20, requiring the exporter to report the occurence so that the guarantee
can be amended to reflect a downward adjustment in CCC's liability made because to do so could invalidate the price
review determination upon which the approval of the guarantee was initially made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two respondents felt that, in the case of cotton, a special exception should be made because of (1) the sensitivity
of cotton to fluctuations in atmospheric conditions resulting in gains or losses in weight; and (2) the long standing
practice of marketing cotton on the basis of landed weights and quality. Changing this practice, to comply with regulations,
will deny the cotton exporters the flexibility to market cotton efficiently.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CCC has determined not to make an exception for destination weights for cotton. At this time there is insufficient
evidence available to CCC that the interim rule has caused any significant problems. As previously noted, when reported
properly to CCC, payment of allowances for destination weights is not a program violation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters requested further clarification of what CCC considers discounts and allowances. Specifically,
they ask whether the definition encompasses carrying charges and normal customer service such as visits to the customer
(to inspect the product, observe its use in the market, etc.), technical assistance, and replacement of faulty or
defective products? The regulation's definition of discounts and allowances includes ``a promise to provide additional
goods, services or benefits in the future.'' Thus, CCC considers an exporter's contractual obligation to provide
technical assistance, or trade servicing, to be, by definition, a discount or allowance to the commodity price on
which CCC price review is based (unless, at the time of price review, the exporter justifies to CCC how such service
or assistance is incorporated into the price, and the price is thus approved by CCC). However, if an exporter does routine
servicing of accounts and customer visits, without any contractual obligation to do so, no discount or allowance
is provided under the definition. CCC has determined not to further modify the definition of discounts and allowances
because there is an infinite variety of circumstances under which exporters could provide a wide range of services
to importers. Exporters are obliged to report instances that may be discounts and allowances, and CCC will make a determination
on a case-by-case basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One respondent suggested that: (1) the definition be changed to allow for normal customer services, and (2) the last
phrase be changed to establish a minimum threshold of 2.5 percent of sales value for defining quality, weight and certain
other settlements as discounts or allowances. CCC has determined it is inappropriate to set such a minimum threshold
because it could permit circumvention of the price review process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A comment was received regarding the definition of Eligible Interest in &sect;1493.20(g). The commenter felt that
the phrase ``the maximum interest rate stated in the payment guarantee, when determined or adjusted by CCC will not
exceed the average investment rate of the most recent Treasury 52-week bill auction in effect at that time'' seems
to imply that CCC is able to adjust the guaranteed interest rate after the payment guarantee is issued. The respondent
requested clarification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CCC's maximum liability for interest coverage is indicated in the payment guarantee or any amendments thereof. CCC
can issue payment guarantees at either a fixed rate of interest or at an adjustable rate of interest. In the case of a
fixed interest rate, the rate of CCC's interest coverage is determined as of the date of application for that payment
guarantee and is indicated on the face of the payment guarantee. This maximum eligible interest rate coverage will
not change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On adjustable rate coverage payment guarantees, the method or formula for determining the eligible interest rate
coverage is established for specific time periods. The operative phrase in the definition is ``when determined or
adjusted by CCC.'' For example, currently on GSM&hyph;103 payment guarantees which allow for an adjustment in CCC's
eligible interest coverage, the determination of maximum interest coverage is made on the date of export and adjusted
only on the due dates for principal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that CCC adopt, at the option of the lender, a variable rate of interest coverage. CCC allows
the assignee U.S. financial institution to provide credit to the foreign bank on the basis of a variable rate of interest.
However, under the interim rule and prior regulations, CCC states in the Program Announcement for the applicable
country whether its guarantee coverage will be offered with a fixed or adjustable rate of interest coverage. CCC has
determined that if interest rate coverage were determined at the option of the lender, CCC would not be able to adequately
control its risk exposure. Therefore, it has been determined not to make the suggested change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Five respondents commented on the definition of &sect;1493.20(h)(1)(ii), Exported Value, where CCC's payment
guarantee coverage is on the basis of FAS or FOB value on transactions sold on a CFR or CIF basis. All commenters expressed
concern that under this requirement the FAS or FOB coverage will be reduced should the actual freight and/or insurance
increase from what was anticipated at the time of the exporter's application for a payment guarantee. The commenters
noted that the exporter may thus find a portion of the sale amount is uncollectable under the letter of credit because
the financing institution will only pay the exporter the amount recoverable under the payment guarantee, plus the
bank's proportion of shared risk. Other concerns raised were that this requirement is impractical and will cause
problems for all parties because: (1) the actual amount of coverage may not be established until long after the sale
has been made; (2) the values stated in the letter of credit and the import licenses will not reflect the value in final
payment guarantee; and (3) the values in the final payment schedule will not reflect the values in the payment guarantee
nor will they reflect the agreement between the buyers and sellers at the time the contract was made. Commenters stated
that the requirement will reduce use of the programs because exporters may stop selling CFR and instead offer only
on a FOB basis. U.S. exporters could also be hurt if buyers, who previously purchased on a CFR basis, choose to charter
ships for themselves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The arguments made by the commenters are compelling. CCC's intent in framing the provision of the interim rule was
not to expose exporters, importers or assignees to unmanageable risks. CCC has determined to revise &sect;1493.20(h)(1)(ii)
and &sect;1493.80(a)(7) to return to the practice of using the exporter's valuation of freight and insurance costs
at time of application for a payment guarantee as the basis for determining exported commodity value under the payment
guarantee. CCC recognizes that this change may be viewed as exposing CCC to an added measure of liability in cases where
actual freight costs turn out to be lower than estimated in the exporter's application. However, CCC notes that its
price review procedure confirms that both the overall CFR or CIF price and the implied FOB or FAS commodity price are
within acceptable ranges at the time of application. This ensures against exporters deliberately under-estimating
freight cost at the time of application in order to finance indirectly a significant portion of freight costs in the
commodity financing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that in &sect;1493.20(k), Foreign Bank Letter of Credit, the reference to International
Chamber of Commerce (ICC), Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits, Publication No. 400 be replaced
with ``latest revision'' to avoid the need for an amendment of the rule when the ICC updates this publication. CCC agrees
to this technical change and has revised &sect;1493.20(k) to reflect the suggestion and the fact that ICC Publication
No. 400 has been revised and issued as ICC Publication No. 500. We have also included the use of the copyright symbol,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0037 unknown -->
, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to reflect the proprietary interest of the ICC in this publication.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although no public comment was received regarding the definition of ``Incoterms'' found at &sect;1493.20(q), CCC
has updated the final rule to reflect the current International Chamber of Commerce's abbreviation for the term ``Cost
and Freight''. Accordingly, CCC uses the abbreviation ``CFR,'' makes such correction to &sect;1493.20(q), and
further acknowledges the alternative abbreviations, ``C&amp;F'' and ``CNF'', because of their continued common
commercial use. Additional language is also added to this definition to indicate CCC's position that contractual
obligations are incurred by the use of these terms by program participants. Additionally, we have again included
the use of the copyright symbol, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

One commenter suggested that the phrase in &sect;1493.20(s), Late Interest, `` *&blank;*&blank;* beginning on
the first day after which the claim for loss is found in good order by CCC *&blank;*&blank;* '' be changed to `` *&blank;*&blank;*
beginning on the first day after receipt of a claim which CCC has determined to be in good order *&blank;*&blank;* ''
in order to be consistent with &sect;1493.120(c), Late Interest Payment. CCC has determined that the definition
of ``Late interest'' contained in &sect;1493.20(s) be revised as suggested to avoid inconsistency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concerning &sect;1493.20(v)(3), Port Value, one commenter felt that when CCC announces CFR or CIF coverage, the
cost of bulk destination bagging should be covered by the credit guarantee, provided that the total cost of ocean freight
for bulk shipment plus all costs of bagging at the destination does not exceed the comparable cost of ocean freight
for bagged cargo. CCC does consider that packaging materials for bulk commodities may be an integral part of the commodity
sale. Hence, on a bulk commodity sale which includes destination bagging, CCC would permit the costs of bags, needles
and twine exported from the U.S. with the commodity to be included in the payment guarantee. Further, CCC will issue
payment guarantees on CFR or CIF sales with destination bagging, if all costs of the bagging at destination are deducted
as provided in &sect;1493.20(h)(3) and &sect;1493.20(v)(3). However, CCC disagrees that CCC should cover the costs
of foreign labor involved in destination bagging in its payment guarantee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A comment regarding &sect;1493.20(x), Related Obligation, suggested that since draft(s) are not always used, the
wording of the last sentence should be amended to read: ``The U.S. financial institution is entitled to such payments
because it has financed the obligation arising under the letter of credit.'' CCC agrees and has revised the language
of &sect;1493.20(x) accordingly.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment was received regarding the applicant's financial responsibility. The commenter was concerned that
small European companies opening offices in the U.S. in order to take advantage of USDA agricultural programs can
and will make corrupt payments or grant after sales services because their maximum exposure is limited to a small office
and minimal assets. In its experience with participants under the GSM&hyph;102/103 programs, CCC finds no grounds
for this concern. Of those few instances of corrupt payments or after sales services that have been identified in CCC
guaranteed transactions (principally in connection with past sales to Iraq), such program violations have been
no more prevalent in transactions entered into by the U.S. offices of small European-based companies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This same commenter suggested that the determination of financial responsibility should be predicated on an applicant
having a minimum net worth of $5 million, or of an amount relative to GSM business done, such as 10% of estimated annual
business. It is CCC's view that setting minimum net worth requirements would unreasonably and unfairly exclude virtually
all small export companies currently participating in the programs. Small exporters play a significant role, especially
in relation to certain countries and certain commodities, and often where frequent small deliveries are desired
by foreign buyers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, CCC's experience with the financial responsibility requirement introduced in the interim rule has been
unsatisfactory. The requirement appears to have little or no value in protecting CCC from financial exposure due
to program violations by an exporter. Nor has this requirement enhanced CCC's ability to recapture financial losses
by pursuing exporters for monetary judgments in the event of a program violation. CCC's potential financial liability
in issuing a payment guarantee is the risk of default from the foreign bank issuing the letter of credit. The rates of
transaction nonperformance and of program violations have been very low. CCC takes any program violation seriously
and pursues administrative actions against exporters shown to have violated the program or other applicable U.S.
laws. However, demonstrating a minimum level of financial assets, or meeting other financial tests, does not materially
enhance CCC's ability to recover losses. Such tests are unreliable and quickly outdated. Therefore, CCC has decided
to delete all references to financial responsibility from &sect;1493.30 and from &sect;1493.30(d)(1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CCC has revised the scope of the certification statement required by &sect;1493.30(a)(6). This section has required
applicants to certify that ``the applicant; any owner, in whole or in part; or any employee is not currently debarred
or suspended from contracting with or participating in programs administered by any U.S. Government Agency.'' CCC
has determined that this certification requirement should be eased in recognition that large companies, especially
publicly-traded ones with many shareholders, cannot make the certification with absolute knowledge of its truth.
Section 1493.30(a)(6) now requires the following certification: ``I certify, to the best of my knowledge and belief,
that neither [name of applicant] nor any of its principals has been debarred, suspended, or proposed for debarment
from contracting with or participating in programs administered by any U.S. Government agency. (``Principals,''
for the purpose of this certification, means officers; directors; owners of five percent of or more stock; partners;
and persons having primary management or supervisory responsibility within a business entity (e.g., general manager,
plant manager, head of a subsidiary division, or business segment, and similar positions)). I further agree that,
should any such debarment, suspension, or notice of proposed debarment occur in the future, [name of applicant] will
immediately notify CCC.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In keeping with the above change in certification, &sect;1493.30(d), Ineligibility for Program Participation,
has been revised to delete subparagraph (4) which made ineligible any applicant employing any individual who is debarred
or suspended. This change recognizes that some applicants will not be in a position to determine whether or not a single
employee is debarred or suspended.

Section 1493.40 Application for Payment Guarantee
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three respondents commented on the description and value of discounts and allowances, &sect;1493.40(a)(10). The
commenters suggested that this requirement is impractical because most discounts and allowances are not known until
the date of export and many times are not quantifiable until the goods have been discharged. One commenter felt that
if the intention of this requirement is to uncover any attempt to obtain coverage, through prior agreement, for an
amount greater than the value of the commodity transaction, a better approach would be to prohibit any discounts or
allowances which are not due to contingencies or acts which are not known at the time of sale. One commenter suggested
that this requirement be deleted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CCC has determined that to protect the integrity of the program and to limit CCC's contingent liability in the event
of a default, the definition of discounts and allowances contained in &sect;1493.20(f) and the required reporting
thereof under &sect;1493.40(a)(10) and &sect;1493.80(a)(8) is necessary and appropriate. Discounts or allowances
that are unknown by the exporter at the time of application for a payment guarantee, of course, cannot be reported to
CCC at the time of application. However, some discounts and allowances may be provided for in the sales contract. These
discounts and allowances should be reported by the exporter at time of application. If known discounts or allowances
are not reported to CCC at the time of application, CCC cannot adequately price review the transaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When a conditional or contingent discount or allowance is provided for under the terms of the export sales contract,
it should be noted in the application, but not deducted from the port value unless agreed by CCC. This is because the
exporter may not know, at the time, whether the condition(s) will arise and the discount or allowance will be paid.
The exporter should report the value of the discount or allowance, if it has been paid, at the time of filing the evidence
of export report. If a payment of a discount or allowance occurs after the submission of an evidence of export report,
the exporter must report the value of the discount or allowance in an amended evidence of export report, and should
notify the U.S. assignee, if any (see previous discussion of this point concerning the definition of ``discounts
and allowance,'' &sect;1493.20(f)). In the event of a claim under the payment guarantee, CCC may hold an exporter
liable for value of the unreported discounts and allowances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1493.40(a)(14) has been revised in this final rule for the purpose of clarity. Applicants often were unable
to report the address of the foreign bank issuing the letter of credit. The language of this subsection has been changed
to now state ``the address or location'' of the foreign bank. CCC has determined this change will still provide sufficient
information to identify the foreign bank issuing the letter of credit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1493.40(a)(15) has been revised in this final rule to delete the requirement to include the estimated principal
payment due dates and amounts due. CCC is able to make this calculation using other information reported under this
subsection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1493.40(a)(16) has been revised in this final rule to add the number of the Export Enhancement Program, Dairy
Export Incentive Program, Sunflowerseed Oil Assistance Program or Cottonseed Oil Assistance Program Agreement
assigned by USDA, as applicable. This added information is not a burdensome requirement for the exporter and assists
CCC in tracking concurrent use of credit and subsidy programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment was received regarding USDA's price review process established under &sect;1493.40(b). The commenter
questioned how USDA can properly determine a fair market price. The respondent felt that U.S. companies will lose
the incentive to be innovative and aggressive in creating markets for their products if the USDA controls prices.
This commenter felt that while high prices may indicate kickbacks or other improprieties and warrant a complete investigation,
the practice of price review should be used as a tool to monitor the program, and should not constitute ``price approval.''
The commenter recommended that the practice of price review should be eliminated from the regulations. CCC disagrees.
The price review procedure under the GSM&hyph;102/103 programs is not a ``price approval'' mechanism. Although
CCC does have the right to reject applications for a payment guarantee that, in CCC's opinion, do not reflect market
parameters, in practice, when a sales price raises questions, the exporter is given the opportunity to explain the
factors relating to the price. Often, after receiving such information, CCC has been able to approve the application.
CCC's intention is not to control the price that an exporter may negotiate with an importer. However, CCC does have
an obligation to review those sales prices which appear excessively high or low because they may be linked to possible
program violations, such as kickbacks, extra sales services or the inclusion of lower value foreign content in the
shipment. Therefore, the current practice of price review for GSM&hyph;102/103 program applications will continue.

One commenter questioned whether CCC considered normal customer service, e.g., visits to the customer to inspect
the product, to observe its use in the market, to provide technical assistance, or to replace faulty or defective products
to be extra sales services under &sect;1493.50(b). The respondent requested that CCC clarify and give examples or
guidelines of what is considered to be extra sales services. CCC cautions exporters that any extension of extra sales
services provided to an importer that can be directly linked to a GSM&hyph;102 or GSM&hyph;103 payment guarantee
may be construed as a discount or allowance which, although permissible, must be reported and deducted from the value
of the guarantee. On the other hand, an extra sales service not linked to the basic commercial intent of the transaction
(i.e., that is extraneous to the transaction) is prohibited. The instance, type, nature, and the extent of linkage
to the sales transaction must be examined on a case-by-case basis. As previously discussed in relation to comments
received concerning the definition of ``Discounts and Allowances,'' &sect;1493.20(f), CCC will review the specific
circumstances when they are reported. Therefore, CCC has determined not to provide specific examples of extra sales
services_extraneous and otherwise_in the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two respondents made comments regarding &sect;1493.50(a), which requires the exporter to certify that the agricultural
commodity or product exported under the payment guarantee is a U.S. agricultural commodity or product as defined
by &sect;1493.20(z). While both commenters fundamentally agree with the U.S. origin requirement, they felt that
because of the changes in the U.S. market environment, particularly the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement, a rigid
interpretation of the U.S. origin requirement will interfere with the normal operation of the U.S. grain marketing
system. The commenters suggested that an alternative to the U.S. origin requirement might be a ``transit billing''
system similar to the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service's current policy for all commodity purchases,
except dairy products. Under transit billing, in the commenter's opinion, domestic origin requirements should
be satisfied if a grain handling facility containing commingled domestic and foreign origin commodities, has quantities
of domestic origin commodities equal to or greater than the quantity called for in the contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CCC has reviewed the ``transit billing'' system and has determined that such a system will not meet the statutory requirements
of the 1990 Act because the definition of a U.S. agricultural commodity contained in Section 102(7) of the Act requires
that an agricultural commodity exported under the GSM&hyph;102/103 programs be ``entirely produced in the United
States.'' Transit billing would permit unlimited commingling of U.S. and imported grains with rules that would maximize
the likelihood that a warehouseman would always have a sufficient theoretical U.S.-origin stock position to be able
to fill export orders for U.S. grain. It would be a formula accounting system which would be unrelated to the actual
identity of the grain being handled. Therefore, it has been determined that transit billing would not meet the statutory
requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another alternative proposed by one of the commenters is for CCC to allow foreign agricultural components to be exported
but to provide no guarantee coverage on the value of any such components. The commenter proposed this option in reference
to bulk grains, an agricultural commodity, not a product of an agricultural commodity. As previously noted, Section
102(7) of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978, as amended by the 1990 Act does not, in CCC's view, permit any foreign content
to be included in the U.S. agricultural commodity exported under the GSM&hyph;102/103 programs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One respondent asked if under &sect;1493.60(b), Period of Guarantee Coverage, the language ``the payment guarantee
will apply to the period beginning either on the date(s) of export(s) or on the date when interest begins to accrue,
whichever is earlier,'' implies that CCC will guarantee credits on which interest accrues prior to disbursement
of funds to the U.S. exporter. The answer is yes. CCC will provide a payment guarantee that includes interest coverage
which begins before the date of export from the U.S. in circumstances where the exporter has sold the commodity at an
U.S. interior point of loading of the export carrier (e.g., railcar or truck for export to Mexico). However, interest
coverage begins no earlier than the date interest begins to accrue under the guaranteed credit. This date could be
earlier than the date of disbursement of funds to the U.S. exporter if this was provided for in the foreign bank's letter
of credit or related obligation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments were received suggesting changes in &sect;1493.60(e), Reserve Coverage for Loading Tolerances. Three
respondents believed the purpose of this provision is to allow the exporter to pay the guarantee fee only on the actual
amount of the coverage required, and recommended that the section be changed to allow the exporter to apply for a payment
guarantee (and pay the guarantee fee) based on any quantity, within the sales contract specifications, reserving
coverage up to the maximum contract tolerance. One of the commentors also felt that, as a result of the requirement
in the interim rule, exporters would pay excessive fees for coverage not used and credit availability would be encumbered
without product exported. CCC agrees with these comments and has revised the language of &sect;1493.60(e) to permit
exporters to apply for guarantee coverage, and pay the guarantee fee, on the basis of any quantity within the upper
and lower tolerance and to reserve coverage up to the upper tolerance. After export, when coverage has been reserved,
the exporter will be permitted to amend the payment guarantee and pay an additional fee based upon the difference between
the original payment guarantee quantity and the actual quantity exported. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments were received regarding &sect;1493.60(i), Amendments. One commenter, a financial institution, felt
that a request for an amendment of the payment guarantee should not be restricted to the exporter, and that the assignee
should also be able to submit a request for an amendment. CCC disagrees. To do so would place CCC in the position of unilaterally
agreeing to amend, and possibly breach, a contractual agreement with exporters at the request of a third party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second comment received on &sect;1493.60(i) concerned interpretation of the phrase `` *&blank;*&blank;* any
amendment to the payment guarantee may result in an increase of the guarantee fee.'' The commenter felt if it is the
intention of CCC to assess fees for amendments, which are not always within the exporter's control, then this language
should be deleted. It is not CCC's intention to assess additional fees for all amendments. In response to the comment,
the language of &sect;1493.60(i) has been clarified to provide the possibility that CCC may charge a fee for a requested
amendment when, as a consequence of the request, CCC may incur additional liability.

Several comments were received on this section. A general comment was made regarding the proprietary nature of the
information submitted by the exporter. The commenter felt that any information submitted should be deemed confidential
and access restricted; neither foreign buyers nor competitors should have access. CCC has not included in the Interim
Rule or Final Rule provisions on the protection of participant information because this matter is governed by the
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and the Privacy Act. Moreover, section 402(a)(3) of the Agricultural Trade Act
of 1978, as amended by the 1990 Act (7 U.S.C. 5662(a)(3)) provides that ``the personally identifiable information
contained in reports under subsection (a) [records of the exporter] may be withheld in accordance with section 552(b)(4)
of title 5, United States Code.'' This section further provides that ``any officer or employee of the Department of
Agriculture who knowingly discloses confidential information as defined by section 1905 of Title 18, United States
Code, shall be subject to section 1905 of Title 18, United States Code. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed
to authorize the withholding of information from Congress.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three respondents requested that &sect;1493.80(a), Report of Export, be amended to allow 60 days for submitting
evidence of export reports for truck or rail export shipments because it is difficult to obtain the required entry
certificate into Mexico within the 30&hyph;day filing period. CCC recognizes that experience validates this comment.
In the past it has often been necessary for the exporter to obtain an amendment to the payment guarantee allowing an
extension of the time period for filing the evidence of export report. In a study of this problem, CCC determined that
an extension of the filing time limit from 30 days to 60 days for truck and rail exports would decrease the number of this
type of amendment request by approximately one-half. Accordingly, in this final rule &sect;1493.80(a) has been
simplified and &sect;1493.80(b) revised to provide a time limit of 60&hyph;days for filing evidence of export reports
for truck and rail exports. With this revision, &sect;1493.80(b) continues to provide for the filing of evidence
of export reports for shipments by other types of carriers within a 30 day time limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, for the sake of simplicity and expediency, CCC has deleted the requirement previously contained in &sect;1493.80(a)(9)
of the interim rule requiring the exporter or its assignee to report a final payment schedule showing the payment dates
and the amounts separately for both principal and interest. CCC now has computer capability to calculate this information
from the other information submitted in the evidence of export report and the terms of the payment guarantee. The requirement
for the payment schedule information has often been a hindrance to the timely filing of complete evidence of export
reports because exporters routinely must have their assignee submit this information. It is expected that this change
will expedite filings of evidence of export reports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters requested clarification regarding &sect;1493.80(b), Time Limit for Submission of Evidence of Export.
This sub-part allows for an extension of the time limit if it is determined to be in the best interests of CCC (but not
if payments by the foreign bank are past due under the payment guarantee). The commenters would like to see clarification
of CCC's policies once a defaulting foreign bank is again current with its account. It was suggested that a sentence
be added stating that CCC will reconsider the payment guarantee status once the foreign bank resumes payments and
becomes current in its obligations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CCC has determined to address this comment by revising the language of &sect;1493.80(b) to indicate that if the report
required by paragraph (a) of &sect;1493.80 is not received by the time limit specified, the payment guarantee will
become null and void, but only if failure to make timely filing resulted, or would be likely to result, in: (1) significant
financial harm to CCC; (2) the undermining of an essential regulatory purpose of the program; (3) obstruction of the
fair administration of the program; or (4) a threat to the integrity of the program. Section 1493.80(b) will still
permit CCC to extend the time limit for filing of evidence of export reports if such extension is determined by the General
Sales Manager to be in the best interests of CCC.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two respondents commented on &sect;1493.90(c), which requires the exporter to certify that the exporter or exporter's
assignee has, and will retain, documents evidencing the obligation of the foreign bank for five years after the final
installment due date. Both commenters said that the exporter can make the certification for themselves, but that
they have no legal recourse at their disposal, to require the third parties to comply with this provision. The commenters
recommended that the certification be deleted. CCC has considered the comments made and agrees that the certification
can be deleted because the exporter or the exporter's assignee is already bound by &sect;1493.140(e)(1) to retain
documentation evidencing the obligation of the foreign bank for a period of five years after the final installment
date. This document retention requirement is further strengthened because evidence of the foreign bank related
obligation is necessary to submit a claim to CCC under the payment guarantee. Therefore, a certification that such
records are being maintained has little practical value. CCC has determined to delete the certification previously
found at &sect;1493.90(c) of the interim rule from this final rule.

Section 1493.100 Proof of Entry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A comment received on &sect;1493.100(a), Diversion, pointed out that while the exporter may contractually preclude
diversion of an FOB shipment, the exporter has no control over the importer's vessel; unless the exporter knowingly
abetted the diversion, there should be no implication of potential exporter liability to CCC under such circumstances.
Under &sect;1493.130(d) of the interim rule, ``the exporter may be liable to CCC for any amount paid under a payment
guarantee when it is determined by CCC that the exporter has engaged in fraud, or has been or is in breach of any contractual
obligation, certification or warranty made by the exporter *&blank;*&blank;*'' Further, the exporter's assignee
may be held liable to CCC under the same standard. However, &sect;1493.130(e), Good Faith, provides that a violation
by an exporter of the certifications, particularly &sect;1493.100 (Proof of Entry), will not affect the validity
of any payment guarantee with respect to an assignee who had no knowledge of such violation or failure to comply at the
time the exporter applied for the payment guarantee or at the time of assignment of the payment guarantee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CCC recognizes the burden placed on exporters with FOB sales in ensuring compliance with program requirements concerning
diversion. However, in view of the legislative mandate imposed on CCC to ensure arrival of program shipments in destination
countries (Title IV, Subtitle A, Section 401 of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978, as amended by the 1990 Act), and
in view of the fact that CCC has a contractual relationship only with the exporter, not with the importer, CCC sees no
feasible alternative to the present policy of holding exporters responsible for maintaining proof of entry documentation
as a means of preventing diversion. This policy makes it in the interest of exporters to make every effort to obtain
binding commitments from foreign buyers to provide such documentation on FOB/FAS sales and not to divert shipments.
The strength of evidence of such efforts by exporters would undoubtedly be of material interest in any situation where
CCC suffered a financial loss on a payment guarantee and found that diversion had taken place. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two respondents commented on &sect;1493.100(b), Proof of Entry. One commenter was unsure what is intended by this
section. Both commenters felt that the only reliable means of obtaining proof of entry is for the exporter to retain
a private surveyor at each location. They felt that this was an unnecessary cost and burden to the exporter and that
there is little justification for this requirement. Clarification of the section was requested. In adding the requirement
for proof of entry in the interim rule, CCC employed the basic requirements for proof of entry documents that are used
for the Export Enhancement Program (EEP). Although a surveyor's report would be an acceptable means of meeting this
requirement, CCC disagrees that it is the only reliable means of obtaining proof of entry. Many countries have provided
such documentation with respect to the EEP program. Further, in the event that traditional forms of entry documentation
are unobtainable, &sect;1493.100(b) permits CCC to consider other types of documents, which can be deemed acceptable
by the GSM. Finally, as stated in the interim rule, the requirement for proof of entry documentation on GSM&hyph;102/103
transactions is mandated by the 1990 Act. Therefore, CCC has determined that no further clarification or change is
necessary to &sect;1493.100.

Section 1493.110 Notice of Default and Claims for Loss
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter suggested that CCC adopt a ``Payment Certificate'' concept (currently incorporated in programs of
the Export-Import Bank of the United States (Eximbank)) under which one claim is submitted covering the payment of
the balance of the guarantee. In follow-up discussions with CCC, the commenter explained the ``Payment Certificate''
concept as being a mechanism where CCC would pre-approve documents that are normally submitted in the claim procedure
and issue a payment certificate which, when submitted at the time of claim, would be evidence that CCC would pay the
claim at a certain time interval after receipt of the payment certificate, notice of default, and subrogation agreement.
CCC has determined that, at this time, it cannot adopt such a measure because it has insufficient resources to review
and pre-approve all documents required for submission when filing a claim. One major difference between Eximbank
and CCC export credit guarantee programs is the sheer number of payment guarantees that CCC issues during a program
year, over 3,000 payment guarantees annually. Eximbank's guarantees are generally much larger in value and fewer
in number. It would not be administratively feasible for CCC to review documentation in advance of issuance of all
of its guarantees. CCC will continue to explore the possibility of adapting the ``payment certificate'' concept
to permit, for certain countries or particular foreign banks, a mechanism that would address the ``time certain for
payment of claims'' element necessary to facilitate securitization of CCC payment guarantees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 It should be recognized, however, that under existing CCC policy, only one claim need be filed (in the sense of providing
full documentation relating to the transaction). Thereafter, only certified notices of failure to receive scheduled
installments, reference to the original claim, and corresponding subrogation agreement need be submitted to CCC.
Accordingly, CCC agrees that &sect;1493.110 should be clarified to reflect this fact and has added a new paragraph
&sect;1493.110(c) to make this policy clearer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter suggested that the reference to ``drafts drawn'' in &sect;1493.110(b)(4)(i)(B)(1), be revised to read
``obligations financed,'' since drafts are not always used as financial obligations. CCC agrees and has adopted
this clearer language in the subsection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter questioned why, under Filing a Claim for Loss, &sect;1493.110(b)(4)(v), CCC requires a copy of the
previously submitted report of export to accompany the claim for loss. CCC requires this in order to accelerate the
claims payment process. CCC considers this a reasonable requirement and therefore, has determined that the requirement
of &sect;1493.110(b)(4)(v) remain unchanged.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter, a financial institution, made a comment pertaining to &sect;1493.120(a), Determination of CCC's
Liability, which states that CCC, upon receipt in ``good order'' of the information and documents under &sect;1493.110(b),
Filing a Claim for Loss, will determine whether or not a loss has occurred for which CCC is liable. The commenter states
that in order for securities to be viewed as ``government credit,'' there can be no risk that the payment under the guarantee
would not be made. The commenter also argued that, due to the extensive list of documents and information required
and the subjective judgement that such documents and information be in ``good order,'' a risk of non-payment by CCC
exists. The recommendation is to require that most documents and information be approved (or alternatively, that
the proper forms be pre-agreed by CCC) prior to issuance of the guarantee. This recommendation would eliminate the
subjective nature of ``good order'' and would eliminate the non-payment risk. This issue has already been addressed
under General Comments (securitization) and in relation to &sect;1493.110. Again, although CCC is not now making
changes to specifically address this concern, CCC will continue to look at possibilities to adapt mechanisms suitable
to CCC programs to facilitate securitization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments were received on &sect;1493.120(c), Late Interest Payment. One respondent (a Federal agency) said
that the late interest is short-term interest and that the rate factor should be based on the ``91-day Treasury bill
rate, not to exceed the 52-week bill rate.'' CCC agrees with the comment that it is more suitable to use a short-term
interest instrument for late interest. Accordingly, CCC has changed &sect;1493.120(c) to provide that late interest
is based on the 91-day Treasury bill. Similarly, changes have been made to &sect;1493.130(b)(1) and (2) to also reflect
the use of a short-term interest instrument as the benchmark for ``late interest'' to be paid both on monies owed to
CCC in a recovery, and on monies recovered by CCC and owed to an exporter or an exporter's assignee under pro rata sharing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other comment pertained to the securitization of payment guarantees. The commenter suggested that &sect;1493.120(c)
establish CCC's obligation to pay a claim within a specified time period. The commentor stated that this was necessary
because a risk of nonpayment or late payment by CCC would be unacceptable to rating agencies reviewing securitization
proposals which include CCC payment guarantees. CCC has determined not to adopt this suggested change for reasons
previously stated in relation to general comments on the interim rule and specifically on &sect;1493.20(s) and &sect;1493.110.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that &sect;1493.120(d), Accelerated Payments, be changed to allow payments to be made on
an accelerated basis at the option of the lender. CCC's policy is to not pay claims for losses in advance of a default
unless it can be determined to be in CCC's best interest to do so. If CCC were to revise &sect;1493.120(d) to allow an
accelerated payment mechanism at the option of the lender, CCC could be required to disburse funds to banks for installment
defaults which have not yet occurred. CCC has determined that this obligation would not be in its best interest, and
that &sect;1493.120(d) will not be changed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One respondent expressed concern that under &sect;1493.120(e)(1), Action Against the Assignee, failure of the
exporter to comply with the requirement to file an amended report of export to reflect post-export adjustments might
jeopardize the assignee's claim. CCC acknowledges the legitimacy of the commenter's concerns. Section 1493.120(e)
does not specify as to what actions CCC may take against the assignee for the failure of the exporter to file amended
evidence of export reports if, for example, later discounts or allowances are granted to the importer by the exporter.
Section 1493.120(e) states that `` *&blank;*&blank;* CCC will not hold the assignee responsible or take any action
or raise any defense against the assignee for any action, omission or statement by the exporter over which the assignee
has no knowledge, provided that: (1) the exporter complies with the reporting requirements under &sect;1493.80
and &sect;1493.90; and (2) the exporter or the exporter's assignee furnishes the statements and documents specified
in &sect;1493.110.'' In a post-export adjustment (i.e., a previously unreported discount or allowance) the assignee
would, most probably, have no knowledge of the exporter's action (consideration given to the importer) and omission
(not filing a corrected evidence of export report). CCC has clarified &sect;1493.120(e) to indicate that assignees
will not be held liable for failure of the exporter to submit to CCC any corrections or amendments to evidence of export
reports.

One comment was received on &sect;1493.130(b)(1), Receipt of Monies. The commenter suggested eliminating CCC's
requirement that all monies received by the lender from any source whatsoever after the payment by CCC of a claim be
paid to CCC. CCC has addressed this issue under General Comment regarding securitization proposals. CCC has determined
not to make this change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two respondents requested changes in the wording of &sect;1493.130(d), Liabilities to CCC, to take into account
that a technical breach by the exporter may be inconsequential, and that the breach may not have been the cause for any
payment made by CCC under the payment guarantee. The suggested rewording of this phrase is `` *&blank;*&blank;* or
has been or is in material breach of any contractual obligation, certification or warranty made by the exporter for
the purpose of obtaining the payment guarantee or in fulfilling an obligation under GSM&hyph;102 or GSM&hyph;103
and such amounts paid by CCC under the payment guarantee resulted from such fraud or material breach by the exporter.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two comments were received regarding the restrictions of &sect;1493.140(a), Assignment. The commenters felt that
financial institutions should be able to place assets they originate into the world capitol markets and that CCC should
facilitate this goal by permitting more than one assignment of the payment guarantee. One commenter, a financial
institution, suggested that CCC allow the financial institution to extend the credit and assign such credit to a grantor
trust or special purpose corporation, such as a Funding Vehicle, established by the financial institution, or let
the Funding Vehicle itself take assignment and extend the credit. The same commenter also recommended that the language
in &sect;1493.11(a) of the previous regulations be included in this section. The previous regulation stated that
``The assignment shall cover all amounts payable under the payment guarantee not already paid and shall not be made
to more than one party, and shall not be subject to further assignment, unless approved in advance by CCC. Any such assignment
may be made to one party as agent or trustee for two or more parties participating in the financing.'' In &sect;1493.140(a)
of the interim rule, CCC deletes the final sentence of the previous &sect;1493.11(a). However, by deleting this language
from the interim rule, CCC did not intend to preclude its consideration of assignments of guarantees to various types
of financial institutions. CCC will consider acknowledging assignments that facilitate securitization of guarantees
and that are consistent with other program requirments. Therefore, although CCC has not restored the particular
sentence in this final rule, &sect;1493.140(a) has been modified to clarify CCC's policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two respondents requested that &sect;1493.140(a)(3) be modified so that when CCC determines a financial institution
to be ineligible to receive an assignment of a payment guarantee, CCC will notify both the exporter and the financial
institution. CCC concurs with this suggestion and has adopted such provision in &sect;1493.140(a)(3) of this final
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A third respondent felt that &sect;1493.140(a)(3) could create difficulties for financial institutions because
the notice of ineligibility would reach them after they had extended credit. The commenter suggested that CCC notify
a financial institution of its ineligibility before the institution extends credit under an anticipated CCC guarantee.
CCC disagrees. CCC does not have the resources to continually monitor the thousands of U.S. financial institutions
which are potentially eligible to receive assignments and to notify those that would be ineligible if they were to
be assigned a CCC payment guarantee. Further, &sect;1493.140(b), Ineligibility of Financial Institutions to Receive
an Assignment, explains the conditions under which an assignment to a financial institution would not be acknowledged
by CCC. If a U.S. financial institution has reason to believe that it might not be eligible under this section of the
regulations, it may contact the Treasurer, CCC to review its situation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters suggested that the provisions in &sect;1493.140(e)(1), Maintenance of Records and Access to
Premises, place unreasonable burdens on the parties involved in the transaction. One commenter, a financial institution,
was concerned that the blanket requirement of access to records pertaining to transactions conducted outside the
program may interfere with bank confidentiality. Although CCC understands this concern, section 402(a)(3) of the
Agricultural Trade Act of 1978, as amended by the 1990 Act, provides that officers or employees of the U.S. Department
of Agriculture are subject to criminal penalties for knowingly disclosing confidential information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter felt that the records pertaining to transactions outside the program should be subject to review
only if they are directly related to transactions made under the program, and that the General Sales Manager's opinion
should not determine whether the outside transaction(s) pertain to program transactions. This commenter recommended
that the regulation apply to outside transactions which ``relate directly'' rather than that ``pertain'' to the
program transaction. CCC disagrees and has determined that the language of &sect;1493.140(e)(1) should remain
unchanged. On a case-by-case basis, and as determined by the GSM, CCC may need to examine records not directly related
to the GSM&hyph;102/103 transaction in order to determine whether a program violation has occurred (e.g., inventory
records may be examined to determine whether foreign content exists in export shipment under the program). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters said that they can request agents, intervening purchasers, and related companies to make available
documents or information requested by CCC, but cannot guarantee access to third party records, particularly those
held by companies or persons located outside the U.S. This is particularly the case with documents which may be generated
by agents of the exporter, or by companies with special arrangements with the exporter which are foreign entities.
Because access to such records may be critical to CCC's efforts to monitor programs and to ensure their integrity,
CCC expects that the exporter will use its contractual and other means of influence to obtain those pertinent records
of the outside parties involved. CCC recognizes that exporters may only be able to obtain from such third parties copies
of those records that pertain to the GSM&hyph;102/103 export transaction in question. The final rule does not require
that the exporter retain all records of such third parties, nor those records pertaining to transactions conducted
outside the program. Further, the final rule does not require that an agent of the exporter, an intervening purchaser,
or parties with a special arrangement with the exporter must make available such records and grant access to their
premises. CCC would expect the exporter to be able to provide copies of any and all records relating to the transaction
held by these entities if so requested by government officials authorized to conduct program reviews.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments recommended that &sect;1493.140(g), Submission of Documents by Principal Officers, be expanded to
permit an authorized full time employee of the exporter to sign all required submissions. CCC agrees with the comment.
On August 7, 1991, CCC issued a Notice to Program Participants which clarified the signatory requirements for submissions
to CCC. The policy reflected in this Notice to Participants has been included in &sect;1493.140(g) of this final rule
to permit principal officers or their designees to sign required submissions to CCC. However, the August 7, 1991 Notice
is not being superseded because it also applies to other export programs and contains examples of how such authorizations
by principals to their designees might be worded.

Overview
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) This subpart contains the regulations governing the operations of the Export Credit Guarantee Program (GSM&hyph;102)
and the Intermediate Credit Guarantee Program (GSM&hyph;103). The GSM&hyph;102 and GSM&hyph;103 programs of the
Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) were developed to expand U.S. agricultural exports by making available export
credit guarantees to encourage U.S. private sector financing of foreign purchases of U.S. agricultural commodities
on credit terms. Under GSM&hyph;102, credit guarantees are issued for terms of up to three years. Under GSM&hyph;103,
credit guarantees are issued for terms of from three to ten years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The programs operate in cases where credit is necessary to increase or maintain U.S. exports to a foreign market
and where private U.S. financial institutions would be unwilling to provide financing without CCC's guarantee.
The programs are operated in a manner intended not to interfere with markets for cash sales. The programs are targeted
toward those countries where the guarantees are necessary to secure financing of the exports but which have sufficient
financial strength so that foreign exchange will be available for scheduled payments. In providing this credit guarantee
facility, CCC seeks to expand market opportunities for U.S. agricultural exporters and assist long-term market
development for U.S. agricultural commodities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The credit facility created by these programs is the CCC payment guarantee. The payment guarantee is an agreement
by CCC to pay the exporter, or the U.S. financial institution that may take assignment of the exporter's right to proceeds,
specified amounts of principal and interest due from, but not paid by, the foreign bank issuing an irrevocable letter
of credit in connection with the export sale to which CCC's guarantee coverage pertains. By approving an exporter's
application for a payment guarantee, CCC encourages private sector, rather than governmental, financing and incurs
a substantial portion of the risk of default by the foreign bank. CCC assumes this risk, in order to be able to operate
the programs for the purposes specified in &sect;1493.2.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Credit facility mechanism
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Typically, in export sales of U.S. agricultural commodities, payment by the importer is made under an irrevocable
letter of credit. For the purpose of the GSM&hyph;102 and GSM&hyph;103 programs, CCC will consider applications
for payment guarantees only in connection with export sales of U.S. agricultural commodities where the payment for
the agricultural commodities will be made in one of the two following ways: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) An irrevocable foreign bank letter of credit, issued in favor of the exporter, specifically stating the deferred
payment terms under which the foreign bank is obligated to make payments in U.S. dollars as such payments become due;
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An irrevocable foreign bank letter of credit, issued in favor of the exporter, that is supported by a related obligation
specifically stating the deferred payment terms under which the foreign bank is obligated to make payment to the exporter,
or the exporter's assignee, in U.S. dollars as such payments become due. The exporter may assign the right to proceeds
under the letter of credit or related obligation to a U.S. bank or other financial institution so that the exporter
may realize the proceeds of the sale prior to the deferred payment date(s) as set forth in the irrevocable foreign bank
letter of credit or its related obligation. The GSM&hyph;102 and GSM&hyph;103 programs are designed to protect the
exporter or the exporter's assignee against those losses specified in the payment guarantee resulting from defaults,
whether for commercial or noncommercial reasons, by the foreign bank obligated under the letter of credit or related
obligation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Program administration
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The GSM&hyph;102 and GSM&hyph;103 programs will be administered pursuant to this part and any Program Announcements
and Notices to Participants issued by CCC pursuant to, and not inconsistent with, this part. These programs are under
the general administrative responsibility of the General Sales Manager (GSM), Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS/USDA).
The review and payment of claims for loss will be administered by the Office of the Controller, CCC. Information regarding
specific points of contact for the public, including names, addresses, and telephone and facsimile numbers of particular
USDA or CCC offices, will be announced by a public press release (see &sect;1493.20(c), ``Contacts P/R'').

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Country allocations and program announcements
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. From time to time, CCC will issue a Program Announcement to announce a GSM&hyph;102 and/or GSM&hyph;103 program
allocation for a specific country. The Program Announcement for a country allocation will designate specific allocations
for U.S. agricultural commodities or products thereof. Exporters may negotiate export sales to buyers in that country
for one of the commodities specified in the Program Announcement and seek payment guarantee coverage within the dollar
amounts of specified coverage for that commodity. The Program Announcement will contain a requirement that the exporter's
sales contract contain a shipping deadline within the applicable program year. The final date for a contractual shipping
deadline will be stated in the Program Announcement. Program Announcements may also contain a specified ``undesignated''
or ``unallocated'' dollar amount for the purpose that if dollar amounts specified for a specific commodity for a country
become fully used, an additional allocation from the ``unallocated'' or ``undesignated'' portion of the total country
allocation may then be designated for a specific commodity. Program Announcements that include an ``allocated''
or ``undesignated'' dollar amount will contain further information on the ``unallocated'' or ``undesignated''
portion of the country allocation.

the application is true and correct and, further, that all requirements set forth in this section have been or will
be met. The exporter will be required to provide further explanation or documentation with regard to applications

the statement set forth in &sect;1493.40(a)(18), certifies that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The agricultural commodity or product to be exported under the payment guarantee is a United States agricultural
commodity or a product thereof, as defined in &sect;1493.20(z);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) There have not been and will not be any corrupt payments or extra sales services or other items extraneous to the

requirements of &sect;1493.30, and the exporter will immediately notify CCC if there is a change of circumstances
which would cause it to fail to meet such requirements. If the exporter breaches or violates these certifications
with respect to a GSM&hyph;102 or GSM&hyph;103 payment guarantee, CCC will have the right, notwithstanding any other
rights provided under this subpart, to annul guarantee coverage for any commodities not yet exported and/or to proceed

that CCC reserve additional guarantee coverage to accommodate up to the amount of the upward loading tolerance specified
in the export sales contract. If such additional guarantee coverage is available at the time of application and CCC
determines to make such reservation, it will so indicate to the exporter. In the event that the exporter ships a quantity
greater than the amount on which the guarantee fee was paid (i.e., lower loading tolerance), it may obtain the additional
coverage from CCC, up to the amount of the upward loading tolerance, by filing for an amendment to the payment guarantee,
and by paying the additional amount of fee applicable. If such amendment to the payment guarantee is not filed with
CCC by the exporter within 30 days after the date of the last export against the sales contract, CCC may determine not
to reserve the coverage originally set aside for the exporter.

any applicable Program Announcements and Notices to Participants. Amendments may include, but will not be limited
to, a change in the credit period and an extension of time to export. Any amendment to the payment guarantee, particularly
those that result in an increase in CCC's liability under the payment guarantee, may result in an increase in the guarantee
fee. (Technical corrections or corrections of a clerical error which may be submitted by the exporter or the exporter's
assignee are not viewed as amendments.)

export was by rail or truck; or 30 calendar days if the export was by any other carrier. The time period for filing a report
of export will commence upon each date of export of the commodity covered under a payment guarantee. If the evidence
of export report is not received by CCC within the time period for filing, the payment guarantee will become null and
void only if and only to the extent that failure to make timely filing resulted, or would be likely to result, in: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Significant financial harm to CCC; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The undermining of an essential regulatory purpose of the program;

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By providing the statement contained in &sect;1493.80(a)(10), the exporter is certifying that the information
provided in the evidence of export report is true and correct and, further, that all requirements set forth in this
section have been or will be met. The exporter will be required to provide further explanation or documentation with
regard to reports that do not include this statement. If the exporter breaches or violates these certifications with
respect to a GSM&hyph;102 or GSM&hyph;103 payment guarantee, CCC will have the right, notwithstanding any other
rights provided under this subpart, to annul guarantee coverage for any commodities not yet exported and/or to proceed
against the exporter. The exporter, in submitting the evidence of export and providing the statement set forth in
&sect;1493.80(a)(10), certifies that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The agricultural commodity or product exported under a payment guarantee is a United States agricultural commodity
or a product thereof, as defined in &sect;1493.20(z);

(b) Agricultural commodities of the grade, quality and quantity called for in the exporter's sales contract with
the importer have been exported to the country specified in the payment guarantee; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) A letter of credit has been opened in favor of the exporter by the foreign bank shown in the payment guarantee to cover
the port value of the commodity exported; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) There have not been and will not be any corrupt payments or extra sales services or other items extraneous to the
transaction provided, financed, or guaranteed in connection with the transaction, and that the transaction complies
with applicable United States law; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The information provided pursuant to &sect;1493.30 has not changed, the exporter still meets all of the qualification
requirements of &sect;1493.30 and the exporter will immediately notify CCC if there is a change of circumstances
which would cause it to fail to meet such requirements.

. Upon receipt in good order of the information and documents required under &sect;1493.110, CCC will determine whether
or not a loss has occurred for which CCC is liable under the applicable payment guarantee, this subpart and any applicable
supplemental Program Announcements and Notices to Participants. If CCC determines that it is liable to the exporter

(1) The guaranteed value as stated in the payment guarantee, plus eligible interest; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

will accrue in favor of the exporter or the exporter's assignee beginning with the first day after the day of reciept
of a claim found by CCC to be in good order and continuing until and including the date that payment is made by CCC. Late
interest will be paid on the guaranteed amount, as determined by paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, and will
be calculated based on the average investment rate of the most recent Treasury 91-day bill auction as announced by
the Department of Treasury as of the due date.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Accelerated payments
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. CCC will pay claims only for losses on amounts not paid as scheduled. CCC will not pay claims for amounts due under an
accelerated payment clause in the export sales contract, the foreign bank's letter of credit, or any obligation owed
by the foreign bank to the assignee U.S. financial institution which is related to the foreign bank's letter of credit
issued in favor of the exporter, unless it is determined to be in the best interests of CCC by the Controller, CCC. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, CCC at its option may declare the entire amount of the unpaid balance, plus accrued interest, in default
and make payment to the exporter or the exporter's assignee in addition to such other claimed amount as may be due from
CCC.

Notification
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

. Upon payment of loss to the exporter or the exporter's assignee, CCC will notify the foreign bank of CCC's rights under
the subrogation agreement to recover all moneys in default.

Receipt of monies
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) In the event that monies for a defaulted payment are recovered by the exporter or the exporter's assignee from
the importer, the foreign bank, or any other source whatsoever, such monies shall be immediately paid to the Treasurer,
CCC. If such monies are not received by CCC within 15 business days from the date of recovery by the exporter or the exporter's
assignee, the exporter or the exporter's assignee will owe to CCC interest from the date of recovery to the date of receipt
by CCC. This interest will be calculated based on the latest average investment rate of the most recent Treasury 91-day
bill auction, as announced by the Department of Treasury, in effect on the date of recovery and will accrue from such
date to the date of payment by the exporter or the exporter's assignee to CCC. Such interest will be charged only on CCC's
share of the recovery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If CCC recovers monies that should be applied to a payment guarantee for which a claim has been paid by CCC, CCC will
pay the holder of the payment guarantee its pro rata share immediately, provided that the required information necessary
for determining pro rata distribution has been furnished. If payment is not made by CCC within 15 business days from
the date of recovery or 15 business days from receiving the required information for determining pro rata distribution,
whichever is later, CCC will pay interest calculated on the latest average investment rate of the most recent Treasury
91-day bill auction, as announced by the Department of Treasury, in effect on the date of recovery and such interest
will accrue from such date to the date of payment by CCC. The interest will apply only to the portion of the recovery payable
to the holder of the payment guarantee.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Allocation of recoveries
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Recoveries made by CCC from the importer or the foreign bank, and recoveries received by CCC from the exporter, the
exporter's assignee, or any other source whatsoever, will be allocated by CCC to the exporter or the exporter's assignee
and to CCC on a pro rata basis determined by their respective interests in such recoveries. The respective interest
of each party will be determined on a pro rata basis, based on the combined amount of principal and interest in default.
Once CCC has paid out a particular claim under a GSM&hyph;102 or GSM&hyph;103 payment guarantee, CCC prorates any
collections it receives and shares these collections proportionately with the holder of the guarantee until both
CCC and the holder of the guarantee have been reimbursed in full. Appendix A to &sect;1493.130_Illustration of Pro
Rata Allocation of Recoveries_provides an example of the methodology used by CCC in applying this paragraph (c).

Liabilities to CCC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Notwithstanding any other terms of the payment guarantee, the exporter may be liable to CCC for any amounts paid by
CCC under the payment guarantee when and if it is determined by CCC that the exporter has engaged in fraud, or has been
or is in material breach of any contractual obligation, certification or warranty made by the exporter for the purpose
of obtaining the payment guarantee or for fulfilling obligations under GSM&hyph;102 or GSM&hyph;103. Further,
the exporter's assignee may be liable to CCC for any amounts paid by CCC under the payment guarantee when and if it is
determined by CCC that the exporter's assignee has engaged in fraud or otherwise violated program requirements.

exporter to comply with the provisions of &sect;1493.100 or &sect;1493.140(e) will not affect the validity of any
payment guarantee with respect to an assignee which had no knowledge of such violation or failure to comply at the time
such exporter applied for the payment guarantee or at the time of assignment of the payment guarantee.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The following example illustrates CCC's policy, as set forth in &sect;1493.130(c), regarding pro rata sharing of
recoveries made for claims filed under the GSM&hyph;102 and GSM&hyph;103 programs. A typical case might be as follows:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The U.S. bank enters into a $300,000 three-year credit arrangement with the foreign bank calling for equal annual
payments of principal and annual payments of interest at a rate of 10 percent per annum and a penalty interest rate of
12 percent per annum on overdue amounts until the overdue amount is paid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The foreign bank fails to make the final principal payment of $100,000 and an interest payment of $10,000, both due
on January 31.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. On February 10, the U.S. bank files a claim in good order with CCC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. CCC's guarantee states that CCC's maximum liability is limited to 98 percent of the principal amount due ($98,000)
and interest at a rate of 8 percent per annum (basis 365 days) on 98 percent of the principal ($7,840).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. CCC pays the claim on February 22.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The latest bond equivalent rate of the 52-week Treasury bill auction average which has been published by the Department
of Treasury in effect on the date of nonpayment (January 31) is 9 percent. The latest investment rate of the 91-day Treasury
Bill auction average which has been published by the Department of Treasury in effect on the date of nonpayment by CCC
(February 11) is 7 percent.

In establishing each party's respective interest in any recovery of losses, the total amount due under the foreign
bank obligation would be determined as of the date the claim is paid by CCC (February 22). Using the above example in
which the amount owed by the foreign bank is $110,000, CCC would be entitled to 95.75 percent ($106,063.07 divided
by $110,765.62) and the holder of the payment guarantee would be entitled to 4.21 percent ($4,668.55 divided by $110,795.62)
of any recoveries of losses after settlement of the claim. Since in this example, the losses were recovered after the
claim has been paid by CCC, &sect;1493.130(b) would apply.

Assignment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) The exporter may assign the proceeds which are, or may become, payable by CCC under a payment guarantee or the right
to such proceeds only to a financial institution in the U.S. The assignment must cover all amounts payable under the
payment guarantee not already paid, may not be made to more than one party, and may not, unless approved in advance by
CCC, be: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Made to one party acting for two or more parties or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Subject to further assignment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An original and two copies of the written notice of assignment signed by the parties thereto must be filed by the
assignee with the Treasurer, CCC, at the address specified in the Contacts P/R.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Receipt of the notice of assignment will ordinarily be acknowledged to the exporter and its assignee in writing
by an officer of CCC. In cases where a financial institution is determined to be ineligible to receive an assignment,
in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, CCC will provide notice thereof, to the financial institution and
to the exporter issued the payment guarantee, in lieu of an acknowledgment of assignment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The name and address of the assignee must be included on the written notice of assignment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ineligibility of financial institutions to receive an assignment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A financial institution will be ineligible to receive an assignment of proceeds which may become payable under a
payment guarantee if, at the time of assignment, such financial institution:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Is not in sound financial condition, as determined by the Treasurer of CCC; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Is the financial institution issuing the letter of credit or branch, agency, or subsidiary of such institution;
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Is owned or controlled by an entity that owns or controls the financial institution issuing the letter of credit;
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Is the U.S. parent of the foreign bank issuing the letter of credit.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ineligibility of financial institutions to receive proceeds
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A financial institution will be ineligible to receive proceeds payable under a payment guarantee approved by CCC
if such financial institution:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) At the time of assignment of a payment guarantee, is not in sound financial condition, as determined by the Treasurer
of CCC; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Is the financial institution issuing the letter of credit or a branch, agency, or subsidiary of such institution;
or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Is owned or controlled by an entity that owns or controls the financial institution issuing the letter of credit;

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Alternative satisfaction of payment guarantees
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. CCC may, with the agreement of the exporter (or if the right to proceeds payable under the payment guarantee has been
assigned, with the agreement of the exporter's assignee), establish procedures, terms and/or conditions for the
satisfaction of CCC's obligations under a payment guarantee other than those provided for in this subpart if CCC determines
that those alternative procedures, terms, and/or conditions are appropriate in rescheduling the debts arising
out of any transaction covered by the payment guarantee and would not result in CCC paying more than the amount of CCC's
obligation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) For a period of five years after the date of expiration of the coverage of a payment guarantee, the exporter or the
exporter's assignee, as applicable, must maintain and make available all records pertaining to sales and deliveries
of and extension of credit for agricultural commodities exported in connection with a GSM&hyph;102 or GSM&hyph;103
payment guarantee, including those records generated and maintained by agents, intervening purchasers, and related
companies involved in special arrangements with the exporter. The Secretary of Agriculture and the Comptroller
General of the United States, through their authorized representatives, must be given full and complete access to
the premises of the exporter or the exporter's assignee, as applicable, during regular business hours from the effective
date of the payment guarantee until the expiration of such five-year period to inspect, examine, audit, and make copies
of the exporter's, exporter's assignee's, agent's, intervening purchaser's or related company's books, records
and accounts concerning transactions relating to the payment guarantee, including, but not limited to, financial
records and accounts pertaining to sales, inventory, processing, and administrative and incidental costs, both
normal and unforeseen. During such period, the exporter or the exporter's assignee may be required to make available
to the Secretary of Agriculture or the Comptroller General of the United States, through their authorized representatives,
records that pertain to transactions conducted outside the program, if, in the opinion of the GSM, such records would
pertain directly to the review of transactions undertaken by the exporter in connection with the payment guarantee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The exporter must maintain the proof of entry required by &sect;1493.100(b), and must provide access to such documentation
if requested by the Secretary of Agriculture or his authorized representative for the five-year period specified
in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. It is the responsibility of all program participants to review, and fully acquaint themselves with, all regulations,
Program Announcements, and Notices to Participants relating to the GSM&hyph;102 or GSM&hyph;103 program, as applicable.
Applicants for payment guarantees under these programs are hereby on notice that they will be bound by any terms contained
in applicable Program Announcements or Notices to Participants issued prior to the date of approval of a payment guarantee.

Submission of documents by principal officers
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. All required submissions, including certifications, applications, reports, or requests (i.e., requests for
amendments), by exporters or exporters' assignees under this subpart must be signed by a principal or officer of the
exporter or exporter's assignee or their authorized designee(s). In cases where the designee is acting on behalf
of the principal or the officer, the signature must be accompanied by: wording indicating the delegation of authority
or, in the alternative, by a certified copy of the delegation of authority; and the name and title of the authorized
person or officer. Further, the exporter or exporter's assignee must ensure that all information/reports required
under these regulations are submitted within the required time limits. If requested in writing, CCC will acknowledge
receipt of a submission by the exporter or the exporter's assignee. If acknowledgment of receipt is requested, the
exporter or exporter's assignee must submit an extra copy of each document and a stamped self-addressed envelope
for return by U.S. mail. If courier services are desired for the return receipt, the exporter or exporter's assignee
must also submit a self-addressed courier service order which includes the recipient's billing code for such service.
