II. Description of the Proposed Amendment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Reclamation (Ohio), submitted proposed Program Amendment
Number 69 by letter dated September 22,1 994 (Administrative Record No. OH&hyph;2059). In this amendment, Ohio proposes
to revise two rules at Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) sections 1501:13&hyph;1&hyph;03 and 13&hyph;7&hyph;05 to
make the Ohio program as effective as the corresponding Federal regulations concerning financial interest statements
and yield data for pasture or grazing land. The substantive rule revisions proposed by Ohio in this amendment are briefly
described below.

4. Appeal of Remedial Actions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

of appeal that any employee may have under State law of a decision by the Chief of the Division of Reclamation, Ohio Department
of Natural Resources, on an employee's appeal of remedial action for prohibited financial interests. Ohio is also
revising paragraphs (L) (2) and (3) to provide that members of the Ohio Reclamation Board of Review and the board's
hearing officers may request advisory opinions from the Director of the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and
Enforcement on issues pertaining to an apparent prohibited financial interest.

IV. Procedural Determinations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order No. 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12778
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Court Justice
Reform) and has determined that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections
(a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory
programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM.
Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions
on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the requirements
of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
National Environmental Policy Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA [30 U.S.C. 1292(d)] provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C).

The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon corresponding Federal regulations for which an economic
analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic effect
upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously
promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have
a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions in the analyses for the corresponding
Federal regulations.

I. Background on the Utah Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 21, 1981, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Utah program. General background information
on the Utah program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the conditions of approval
of the Utah program can be found in the January 21, 1981, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (46 FR 5899). Subsequent actions concerning Utah's program and program amendments can be found at 30 CFR 944.15, 944.16,
and 944.30.

II. Proposed Amendment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated October 4, 1994, Utah submitted a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA (administrative
record No. UT&hyph;979). Utah submitted the proposed amendment at its own initiative with the intention of allowing
companies in the coal industry, if they so desire, to provide a certain amount of their liability insurance through
self-insurance. The provision of the Utah Coal Mining Rules that Utah proposes to revise is Utah Administrative Rule
(Utah Admin. R.) 645&hyph;301&hyph;890.400, Terms and Conditions for Liability Insurance.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Specifically, Utah proposed to revise Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;890.400 by cross-referencing a Utah self-insurance
statutory provision at Utah Code Annotated (U.C.A.) 63&hyph;30&hyph;28. This provision authorizes governmental
entities to purchase liability or liability self-insurance, and to establish trust accounts for self-insurance.
Utah's proposed revision at Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;890.400 reads as follows, with the italicized language
representing wording that is being added to the existing rule, and the capitalized language in brackets representing
wording that is being deleted.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by 4:00 p.m., m.d.t., November 7, 1994. The location and time of the hearing will be arranged with those persons requesting
the hearing. If no one requests an opportunity to testify at the public hearing, the hearing will not be held.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Filing of a written statement at the time of the hearing is requested as it will greatly assist the transcriber. Submission
of written statements in advance of the hearing will allow OSM officials to prepare adequate responses and appropriate
questions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public hearing will continue on the specified date until all persons scheduled to testify have been heard. Persons
in the audience who have not been scheduled to testify, and who wish to do so, will be heard following those who have been
scheduled. The hearing will end after all persons scheduled to testify and persons present in the audience who wish
to testify have been heard.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Executive Order 12778
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed
State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.

3. National Environmental Policy Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA 930 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).

4. Paperwork Reduction Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.

).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

5. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The State submittal that is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an economic
analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic effect
upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously
promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have
a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart Federal regulations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Financial Management Service, U.S. Department of the Treasury (FMS), currently offers Federal agencies two
payment mechanisms for paying Federal obligations. A Federal agency may either request the issuance of a Treasury
check or the initiation of an electronic funds transfer. However, the FMS will soon be making available to Federal
agencies a third payment option called FedSelect, a new check instrument to be used with imprest fund transactions
and other ``on-demand'' payment needs. The preferred method of payment is electronic. However, FedSelect is the
FMS's response to customer needs for a new paper instrument and is to be used only when checks are deemed appropriate
and consistent with FMS policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Federal agencies that use the new payment instrument will be given a supply of FedSelect checks, on Federal Reserve
Bank check stock, which are drawn on a Federal Reserve Bank in its banking capacity, rather than the United States Treasury.
Federal agencies will be able to issue the FedSelect checks on site in payment for United States obligations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These proposed regulations set forth procedural instructions for using FedSelect checks, and define the rights,
responsibilities, and liabilities of the Federal Government, Federal Reserve Banks, and financial institutions
in connection with FedSelect checks. These rules for FedSelect checks differ from those applying to Treasury checks
in three important ways. First, FedSelect checks will be negotiable for 90 or 120 days, whereas Treasury checks are
payable for 1 year after issuance. Second, Federal agencies can at their own discretion stop payment on a FedSelect
check. Stop payment orders generally are not available on Treasury checks. Third, the regulations governing Treasury
checks are inapplicable to FedSelect checks, unless otherwise provided by statute or this proposed rule. In all matters
not addressed by these proposed regulations, FedSelect checks will be governed by the Uniform Commercial Code, as
drafted by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, and by Regulation J (12 CFR Part 210) and
Regulation CC (12 CFR Part 229) of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve.

FMS invites comments regarding the possibility of referencing within either this regulation or the Treasury Financial
Manual a standard dollar limit of $10,000, with $25,000 exceptions by permission of FMS, above which a FedSelect check
could not be issued by an agency. This limit is being considered to be consistent with FMS's electronic payment policies
as contained within 31 CFR Part 206 and to minimize losses to agencies arising from negligence, forgeries, counterfeiting,
and alterations. FMS requests that comments on this matter include any foreseen (positive or negative) effects of
limiting the dollar amount of FedSelect checks, including whether a dollar limit would encourage an agency to participate
in the FedSelect check program.

Rulemaking Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this regulation is not a significant regulatory action as defined in E.O. 12866. Therefore,
a regulatory assessment is not required. It is hereby certified that this regulation will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. A regulatory flexibility analysis is not required. It is anticipated
that FedSelect checks will not negatively affect a substantial number of small entities because of the relatively
low volume of checks to be issued in comparison to the use of other payment mechanisms by Federal agencies.

The regulations in this Part prescribe the rights and liabilities of the United States, the Federal Reserve Banks,
depositary institutions, and others on FedSelect checks. These regulations apply to FedSelect checks issued on
behalf of the United States for payments in connection with United States obligations. FedSelect checks are issued
by Federal agencies on Federal Reserve Bank check stock. FedSelect checks are drawn on the payor Federal Reserve Bank
in its banking capacity. The drawer of a FedSelect check is the United States; the drawee is a Federal Reserve Bank.
Therefore, a FedSelect check shall not be deemed to be drawn on the United States nor shall the Federal Reserve Bank
be deemed its drawer.

Except as otherwise provided by statute or this Part, the regulations governing checks drawn on the United States
or on designated depositaries of the United States (e.g., 31 CFR Parts 235, 240, 245, and 248) are inapplicable to FedSelect
checks. As to definitions and other matters not specifically covered in this Part, FedSelect checks are governed
by Regulation J of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 12 CFR Part 210 (``Regulation J''), Regulation
CC of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 12 CFR Part 229 (``Regulation CC''), and to the extent not
otherwise inconsistent with these regulations, Regulation J, and Regulation CC, the Uniform Commercial Code (``U.C.C.''),
as drafted by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, as all three may from time to time be revised.
Such matters include, but are not limited to, rules regarding general presentment and transfer warranties (as modified
herein), indorsement, and final payment.

(a) Where FedSelect checks are issued on Reserve Bank check stock and drawn on the payor Reserve Bank in its banking
capacity, the payor Reserve Bank shall perform certain functions as fiscal agent of the United States in the issuing,
processing and final payment of FedSelect checks. A payor Reserve Bank shall act as fiscal agent of the United States
on FedSelect checks only when authorized to do so by a Memorandum of Understanding between the Financial Management
Service, U.S. Department of the Treasury (FMS), and the payor Reserve Bank.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The payor Reserve Bank shall perform functions related to FedSelect checks as described in the Treasury Financial
Manual (TFM), Volume II, Chapter 5000, entitled ``Payment And Processing of FedSelect Checks by Federal Reserve
Banks,'' as issued by the FMS. Copies of the TFM are available free to Government agencies. Others who are interested
in ordering a copy may call (202) 874&hyph;9940 or write the Directives Management Branch, Financial Management
Service, Room 5C16, 3700 East-West Highway, Hyattsville, Maryland 20782 for further information. Revisions to

Part and instructions in the Treasury Financial Manual, the payor Reserve Bank shall pay to presenting banks amounts
specified in a FedSelect check upon presentment of the FedSelect check through normal banking channels. Each payor
Reserve Bank may issue operating circulars, letters or bulletins not inconsistent with this Part governing details
of its handling of payments under this Part.

Certification and internal agency control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) A FedSelect check is not a check drawn on the United States Treasury. However, where the drawer of a FedSelect check
is the United States, the requirements and procedures for disbursing and certifying activities under 31 U.S.C. 3321
apply to agency accountable officers issuing FedSelect checks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) FedSelect checks shall be drawn by an individual who is duly authorized by the agency, and shall be certified by
a certifying officer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) When an agency issues a FedSelect check in payment of a United States obligation, such agency certifies the issuance
of the payment contemporaneous to the issuance of the FedSelect check. Therefore, where FedSelect checks are issued
through an automated system, certification occurs through the on-line data transfer between the agency issuing
a FedSelect check and the FMS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Agencies shall ensure that there are proper internal controls over the issuance of FedSelect checks, including
payment authorization, check issuance, and reconciliations. Payment authorization is the process by which vouchers
or invoices are approved for payment by individuals designated to do so by the head of the agency, or their designees.
Check issuance is the physical issuance of a FedSelect check in payment of a duly approved voucher or invoice. Reconciliation
is the process by which amounts authorized for payment are verified against amounts of checks issued.

Presentment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Presentment of FedSelect checks must be made to the payor Reserve Bank. FedSelect checks must be presented through
normal banking channels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) FedSelect checks may have different periods of payability depending on the agencies' requirements. The standard
period of payability will be 90 days. However, at the request of an agency to the FMS, the payability of a FedSelect check
may be increased to 120 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) FedSelect checks shall bear a pre-printed legend, ``Void After 90 Days,'' or ``Void After 120 Days.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) When an outstanding FedSelect check reaches its stale-date, a cancellation indicator will be placed against
it and its status reflected as canceled due to stale-dating. A payor Reserve Bank will refuse to pay a FedSelect check
presented to the bank of first presentment more than the number of days stated on the FedSelect check. A FedSelect check
not timely presented should be surrendered by the holder to the payor Reserve Bank as a non-cash item. The issuance
of another FedSelect check to replace a lost, stolen, or destroyed FedSelect check must be made in accordance with
&sect;247.10.

Presentment warranties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Presenting banks and indorsers of the FedSelect check are deemed to guarantee that all prior indorsements are
genuine, whether or not an express guaranty is placed on the FedSelect check. When the first indorsement has been made
by one other than the payee personally, the presenting bank and the indorsers are deemed to guarantee, in addition
to other warranties, that the person who so indorsed had unqualified capacity and authority to indorse the check on
behalf of the payee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A presenting bank makes the warranties required of a sender under Subpart A of 12 CFR part 210 (Regulation J). This
section does not limit any warranty by a presenter or other party arising under State law. Neither the Department,
an agency nor a Reserve Bank is barred from recovering on a breach of warranty solely because: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The negligence of the Department, an agency or of a Reserve Bank, as fiscal agent, had contributed to a fraudulent
indorsement or material alteration; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Department, an agency or a Reserve Bank, as fiscal agent, had failed to discover promptly an unauthorized signature
or alteration; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) An imposter had fraudulently caused the issuance of a FedSelect check in the name of any existing payee or fictitious
payee; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) An employee of the Department, an agency or a Reserve Bank, as fiscal agent, had caused the fraudulent issuance
of a FedSelect check in the name of any existing payee or fictitious payee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) In the event of a breach of warranty, the payor Reserve Bank may either return the item to the presenting bank or send
to the presenting bank notice of the breach. If, upon receipt of the returned check or notice of the breach, the presenting
bank does not make prompt restitution, the Department, an agency or the payor Reserve Bank may begin appropriate collection
procedures.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) If an agency has notice that a FedSelect check is not received by the payee within a reasonable time after a payment
is due, or that a FedSelect check is lost, stolen or destroyed, the agency must request to the FMS that a stop payment
order be placed on that item. The notice may be given by telephone or facsimile, but if it is given by telephone, such
notice must be confirmed in writing before another payment is issued. The notification must contain sufficient information
to identify the account and/or the obligation to which the payment is related. Payment on a FedSelect check is stopped
if the notice of non-receipt, loss, theft, or destruction is received from the agency at such time and in such manner
as to afford the payor Reserve Bank and the FMS a reasonable opportunity to act on it prior to final payment, as provided
by applicable law. Once a stop payment order has been placed against an outstanding FedSelect check, such stop payment
order will not be removed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The agency that issued the FedSelect check will issue another FedSelect check to replace a lost, stolen or destroyed
FedSelect check, or other form of payment, at its discretion. Items an agency may require before issuing another FedSelect
check include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Written confirmation that the original FedSelect check was lost, stolen, or destroyed; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Confirmation from the FMS that the original FedSelect check is unpaid; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A determination that recovery of the original FedSelect check is unlikely; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) An indemnification agreement executed by the payee and/or indorsee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If a payor Reserve Bank refuses payment on a FedSelect check solely as a result of &sect;247.8(c), the agency that
issued the original FedSelect check may issue, at its discretion, another FedSelect check, or other form of payment,
to a payee or holder upon surrender of the original FedSelect check and execution of such indemnification agreement
as may be required by the agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Upon verification of the existence of a forged or unauthorized indorsement on a FedSelect check which has been
finally paid, the agency that issued the original FedSelect check may issue, at its discretion, another FedSelect
check or other form of payment to the person entitled. Disputes as to any continuing obligations for payment remain
between the agency that issued the payment and the payee. Prior to the issuance of another FedSelect check, the payee
or indorsee of the original FedSelect check may be required to execute an affidavit asserting that the payee or indorsee
was in no way involved in the fraudulent or unauthorized indorsement of the original FedSelect check, in addition
to any indemnification agreement required by the agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) In the case of a FedSelect check payable to the order of two or more persons, the requirements of this section apply
to all designated payees.

Losses and accountability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Agencies will be accountable for all losses arising out of agency activity related to the issuance of FedSelect
checks. Such activities include negligence, fraud perpetrated by an employee or agent of the agency, and fraud perpetrated
by a service-provider or vendor receiving a FedSelect check as payment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If an agency had notice that a FedSelect check was not received by the payee within a reasonable time after a payment
is due, or that a FedSelect check is lost, stolen or destroyed, and the agency failed to request to the FMS that a stop
payment order be placed on that item pursuant to &sect;247.10(a), the agency will be accountable for any loss occurring
as a result of the failure to request stop payment in a timely fashion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Losses caused by the fault or negligence of the FMS will be the accountability of the FMS. Such losses include failure
to adhere to a request by an agency to place a stop payment order on an item in accordance with &sect;247.10(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The FMS will be accountable for losses caused by third-parties, including losses caused by alteration, counterfeit
and forgery of the payee indorsement, unless such losses occur as described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

(a) Agencies are responsible for collection procedures on all improperly paid items arising under the circumstances
described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of &sect;247.11. However, excepting cases of fraud, an agency should write off
a debt and refer it to the FMS for collection if it is not resolved within 90 days after the item was paid. When the FMS collects
on the debt, the funds will be returned to the agency minus an administrative fee for the collection, in accordance
with rules set forth in I TFM 4-3500. Accountability for a debt remains with the agency in accordance with &sect;247.11.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The FMS is responsible for collection procedures on all improperly paid items arising under the circumstances
described in paragraphs (c) and (d) of &sect;247.11. With all such items, the FMS will make an initial demand for refund
of the amount of a check payment to the presenting bank or any other debtor. This demand shall advise the presenting
bank or debtor of the amount demanded and the reason for the demand. All delinquent debts will be subject to interest,
penalties and administrative fees in accordance with the Federal Claims Collections Standards. Any discrepancies
should be brought to the attention of the FMS.

 EPA is proposing to approve revisions to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) which concern the control
of emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from storage of organic liquids, gasoline transfer operations,
and steam drive wells. The intended effect of proposing approval of these rules is to regulate emissions of volatile
organic compounds (VOCs) in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act).
EPA's final action on this notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) will incorporate these rules into the federally approved
SIP. EPA has evaluated each of these rules and is proposing to approve them under provisions of the CAA regarding EPA
action on SIP submittals, SIPs for national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards and plan requirements
for nonattainment areas.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 3, 1978, EPA promulgated a list of ozone nonattainment areas under the provisions of the Clean Air Act, as amended
in 1977 (1977 CAA or pre-amended Act), that included the Monterey Bay Area. 43 FR 8964, 40 CFR 81.305. Because these
areas were unable to meet the statutory attainment date of December 31, 1982, California requested under section
172(a)(2), and EPA approved, an extension of the attainment date to December 31, 1987. 40 CFR 52.238. On May 26, 1988,
EPA notified the Governor of California, pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(H) of the pre-amended Act, that the above
district's portions of the California SIP were inadequate to attain and maintain the ozone standard and requested
that deficiencies in the existing SIP be corrected (EPA's SIP-Call). On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990 were enacted. Public Law 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q. In amended
section 182(a)(2)(A) of the CAA, Congress statutorily adopted the requirement that nonattainment areas fix their
deficient reasonably available control technology (RACT) rules for ozone and established a deadline of May 15, 1991
for states to submit corrections of those deficiencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 182(a)(2)(A) applies to areas designated as nonattainment prior to enactment of the amendments and classified
as marginal or above as of the date of enactment. It requires such areas to adopt and correct RACT rules pursuant to pre-amended
section 172(b) as interpreted in pre-amendment guidance.

This document addresses EPA's proposed action for the following rules from the Monterey Bay Unified Air Pollution
Control District (MBUAPCD): Rule 417, Storage of Organic Liquids; Rule 418, Transfer of Gasoline into Stationary
Storage Containers; and Rule 427, Steam Drive Crude Oil Production Wells. On June 8, 1993, the State of California
was issued a finding of nonsubmittal for the above rules, thus starting an 18 month sanctions clock under section 179(a)
of the CAA. In addition, section 110(c) of the Act provides that EPA promulgate a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP)
no later than two years after a finding under section 179(a). The rules being acted upon in this document were adopted
by the MBUAPCD on August 25, 1993 and were submitted by the State of California to EPA on November 18, 1993. The mandatory
sanctions clock was stopped on December 23, 1993 when EPA determined that the State had made a complete submittal pursuant
to EPA's completeness criteria that are set forth in 40 CFR part 51, appendix V.

EPA adopted the completeness criteria on February 16, 1990 (55 FR 5830) and, pursuant to section 110(k)(1)(A) of the
CAA, revised the criteria on August 26, 1991 (56 FR 42216).

Rule 417 controls VOCs associated with organic liquid storage, and Rule 418 controls VOCs during the transfer of gasoline
from delivery vessels into storage containers. Rule 427 controls emissions from oil wells where production has been
enhanced by steam injection. VOCs contribute to the production of ground level ozone and smog. The rules were adopted
as part of the District's efforts to achieve the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone and in response
to the section 182(a)(2)(A) CAA requirement. The following is EPA's evaluation and proposed action for these rules.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA Evaluation and Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In determining the approvability of a VOC rule, EPA must evaluate the rule for consistency with the requirements of
the CAA and EPA regulations, as found in section 110 and part D of the CAA and 40 CFR part 51 (Requirements for Preparation,
Adoption, and Submittal of Implementation Plans). The EPA interpretation of these requirements, which forms the
basis for today's action, appears in the various EPA policy guidance documents listed in footnote 1. Among those provisions
is the requirement that a VOC rule must, at a minimum, provide for the implementation of RACT for stationary sources
of VOC emissions. This requirement was carried forth from the pre-amended Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purpose of assisting state and local agencies in developing RACT rules, EPA prepared a series of Control Technique
Guideline (CTG) documents. The CTGs are based on the underlying requirements of the Act and specify the presumptive
norms for what is RACT for specific source categories. Under the CAA, Congress ratified EPA's use of these documents,
as well as other Agency policy, for requiring States to ``fix-up'' their RACT rules. See section 182(a)(2)(A). The
CTG documents applicable to Rule 417 are entitled, ``Control of Volatile Organic Emissions from Petroleum Liquid
Storage in External Floating Roof Tanks,'' EPA&hyph;450/2&hyph;78&hyph;047 and ``Control of Volatile Organic
Emissions from Petroleum Liquid Storage in Fixed Roof Tanks,'' EPA&hyph;450/2&hyph;77&hyph;036. The CTG documents
applicable to Rule 418 are ``Control of Volatile Organic Compound Leaks from Gasoline Tank Trucks and Vapor Collection
Systems,'' EPA&hyph;450/2&hyph;78&hyph;051 and ``Control of Volatile Organic Emissions from Bulk Gasoline Plants,''
EPA&hyph;450/2&hyph;77&hyph;035. For some source categories, such as steam-enhanced oil production wells, EPA
did not publish a CTG. In such cases, the District makes a determination of what controls are required to satisfy the

the technological and economic feasibility of the proposed controls are considered. Additionally, for both CTG

are fully enforceable and strengthen or maintain the SIP.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a
substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises
and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under sections 110 and 301 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply
approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose
any new requirements, it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature
of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal
inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs
on such grounds.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA proposes to amend tolerances for residues of the synthetic pyrethroid cyfluthrin in or on the raw agricultural
commodities (RAC's) milk, meat, fat, and meat byproducts of cattle and establish a tolerance for milkfat. The proposed
regulation to amend the tolerances and establish a maximum permissible level for residues of the pesticide in milkfat
was requested in a petition submitted by Miles Corp., Animal Products (formerly Mobay Corp.).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA issued a notice, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of April 3, 1991 (56 FR 13642), which announced that Miles Corp. had submitted pesticide petition (PP) 1F3923 to EPA
requesting that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA),
21 U.S.C. 346a(d), amend 40 CFR 180.436 by increasing tolerances for residues of the insecticide cyfluthrin, [cyano[4-fluoro-3-phenoxyphenyl]-methyl-3-[2,2-dichloroethenyl]-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate],
in or on the raw agricultural commodities milk to 0.08 part per million (ppm) (from 0.01 ppm) and meat, fat, and meat
byproducts of cattle to 0.40 ppm (from 0.05 ppm). The proposal to increase tolerances was submitted in support of direct
application (pour-on) of the pesticide Bayocide Pour On Insecticide containing cyfluthrin to lactating dairy and
beef cattle.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A review of the data indicated that cyfluthrin residues concentrate in fat; therefore, Miles Corp. was asked to amend
the petition by requesting an appropriate milkfat tolerance. On February 14, 1994, Miles Corp. submitted an amended
pesticide petition proposing that tolerances be established for milkfat at 2.5 ppm (reflecting 0.08 ppm in whole
milk).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data submitted in support of these tolerances and other relevant material have been evaluated. The toxicological
and metabolism data and analytical methods for enforcement purposes considered in support of these tolerances are
discussed in detail in related documents published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of August 16, 1989 (54 FR 33718).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A dietary exposure/risk assessment was performed for cyfluthrin using a Reference Dose (RfD) of 0.025 mg/kg bwt/day,
based on a no-observed-effect-level (NOEL) of 2.5 mg/kg/ bwt/day and an uncertainty factor of 100. The NOEL was determined
in a 2-year rat feeding study. The endpoint effects of concern were decreased body weights and inflammation of the
kidneys. The Theoretical Maximum Residue Contribution (TMRC) from established tolerances utilizes 5.5% of the
RfD for the U.S. population or 11% of the RfD if the new tolerances are granted. Established tolerances utilize 20%
of the RfD for nonnursing infants less than 1 year old, the subgroup with the highest estimated exposure to cyfluthrin
residues or 30% of the RfD if the new tolerances are granted. Generally speaking, EPA has no cause for concern if total
residue contribution for published and proposed tolerances is less than the RfD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The metabolism of the chemical in animals for these uses is adequately understood. An adequate analtyical method,
gas-liquid chromatography, is available for enforcement purposes. The enforcement methodology has been submitted
to the Food and Drug Administration for publication in the Pesticide Analytical Manual, Vol. II (PAM II). Because
of the long lead time for publication of the method in PAM II, the analytical methodology is being made available in
the interim to anyone interested in pesticide enforcement when requested from: Calvin Furlow, Public Response and
Program Resources Branch, Field Opearations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection
Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 1132, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson
Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA 22202, (703)-305-5232. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are currently no actions pending against the continued registration of this chemical.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the information and data considered, the Agency has determined that the tolerances established by amending
40 CFR part 180 would protect the public health. Therefore, it is proposed that the tolerances be established as set
forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide under the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended which contains any of the ingredients listed herein may request
within 30 days after publication of this document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the FFDCA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulations. Comments must bear a notation
indicating the document control number, [PP 1F3923/P593]. All written comments filed in response to these petitions
will be available in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, at the address given above from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday, except legal holidays.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact Analysis,
review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant'' as those
actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious
inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering
the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues
arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat.
1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising
tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements, or establishing or raising food additive
regulations do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification
statement to this effect was published in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Michigan has applied for final authorization of revisions to its hazardous waste management program under the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended (hereinafter RCRA). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
has reviewed Michigan's application and has reached a decision, subject to public review and comment, that these
hazardous waste management program revisions satisfy all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization.
Thus, EPA intends to approve Michigan's hazardous waste management program revisions. Michigan's application
for program revision is available for public review and comment.

A. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States with final authorization under section 3006(b) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6929(b) have a continuing obligation to
maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal
hazardous waste management program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When either EPA's or a State program's controlling statutory or regulatory authority is modified or supplemented,
or when certain other changes occur, revisions to State hazardous waste management programs may be necessary. Most
commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes to EPA's regulations in 40 CFR parts 124, 260 through
268, and 270. The procedures that States and EPA must follow for revision of State programs are found at 40 CFR 271.21.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State of Michigan initially received final authorization for its hazardous waste management program effective
on October 30, 1986 (51 FR 36804&hyph;36805, October 16, 1986). Subsequently, Michigan received authorization
for revisions to its program effective on January 23, 1990 (54 FR 225, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November 24, 1989), June 24, 1991 (56 FR 18517, April 23, 1991), and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November 30, 1993 (58 FR 51244, October 1, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 8, 1991, the Governor of Michigan issued Executive Order 1991&hyph;31, which resulted in reorganization
of the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR), the State agency that administers the RCRA program in the
State of Michigan. However, the Order did not immediately take effect due to court challenges by the State House of
Representatives and environmental groups. A State Supreme Court ruling on September 2, 1993, upheld the Governor's
power to organize the executive branch and lifted the stay on the Order, making the Order immediately effective on
September 2, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 10 and August 18, 1994, Michigan submitted an application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seeking authorization of the revised program. The application consisted of a modified program description, a statement
by the Michigan Attorney General, and an addendum to the memorandum of agreement between the State and EPA outlining
the policies, responsibilities and procedures under which the program is administered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has reviewed Michigan's application and has determined that the MDNR's operation of the State hazardous waste
management program continued on and after September 2, 1993, without interruption, and the MDNR has continued to
act as the lead State agency responsible for administering the program. EPA has also determined that the reorganized
MDNR did not result in significant modification of Michigan's hazardous waste management program, nor did the Order
transfer any part of the program from the approved State agency to any other State agency. Therefore, EPA does not view
the reorganization as a transfer within the purview of &sect;271.21(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, EPA has made a decision, subject to public review and comment, that Michigan's hazardous waste program,
as revised, satisfies all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. The public may submit
written comments on EPA's decision up until November 21, 1994. Copies of Michigan's application are available for
inspection and copying at the locations indicated in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 section of this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approval of Michigan's program revision shall become effective when the Regional Administrator's final approval
is published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If adverse comment pertaining to Michigan's program revision is received during the comment period, EPA will publish
either: (1) A notice of disapproval; or (2) a final rulemaking approving the modifications, which would include appropriate
comment response. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If final approval is granted, Michigan will maintain final authorization to operate its hazardous waste management
program as revised. MDNR will continue to have responsibility for permitting treatment, storage, and disposal facilities
within its borders and carrying out other aspects of the RCRA program, subject to the limitation of its revised program
application and previously approved authorities. Michigan also will maintain primary enforcement responsibilities,
although EPA retains the right to conduct inspections under section 3007 of RCRA, and to take enforcement actions
under sections 3008, 3013 and 7003 of RCRA.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS announces the intention of the New England Fishery Management Council (Council) to prepare an SEIS for proposed
Amendment 7 to the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan (FMP). The most recent Northeast Fisheries Science
Center's (NEFSC) Stock Assessment Workshop (SAW 18) for Georges Bank cod and Georges Bank yellowtail flounder recommends
that, in order to avert a collapse of cod and improve stock rebuilding for yellowtail, fishing mortality should be
reduced to as low a level as possible, approaching zero. In the development of Amendment 7, the Council proposes to
adopt the SAW's recommendation and consider all options in meeting this objective while addressing the issue of displacement
of fishing effort. The Council also announces a continuing public process to determine the scope of issues under consideration.
The purpose of this document is to inform the public of this process and of the opportunity to participate in the further
development of Amendment 7 to the FMP. All persons affected by, or otherwise interested in, the proposed amendment
are invited to participate in determining the scope of significant issues to be considered in the SEIS by submitting
written comments. The scoping process also will identify and eliminate issues that are not significant from detailed
study.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Many of the New England multispecies stocks are over-exploited and at extremely low levels of abundance. Scientists
believe that cod, haddock and yellowtail flounder, the three main species making up the Northeast multispecies stock
group, are near or at the point of collapse. Under such conditions, the fishery can expect a prolonged period during
which landings from the resource are substantially below their long-term potential. Due to the reduced spawning
stock size, the probability is low that sufficient numbers of fish will be produced to replace those being removed,
further jeopardizing or delaying stock recovery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Amendment 5 to the FMP was implemented on March&blank;1,&blank;1994 (59&blank;FR&blank;9872), and was intended
to eliminate overfishing through an incremental effort-reduction program, mesh-size increase, expanded spawning
area closures and other measures. When the Council adopted objectives for the amendment more than 3 years ago, cod,
haddock, and yellowtail flounder stocks were being fished at a rate that was on average twice what could be sustained
over the long term, so it designed a plan to reduce fishing effort by half.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the fall of 1993, NMFS informed the Council that the condition of the Georges Bank haddock stock was deteriorating
and in need of more protection than was provided by Amendment 5. NMFS implemented emergency regulations on January&blank;3,&blank;1994
(59&blank;FR&blank;26), which essentially limited the possession limit of haddock to 500 lb (226.8 kg) and extended
the time and area closure for Closed Area II, and subsequently prepared and implemented these measures on a permanent
basis under Amendment 6 (59&blank;FR&blank;32134, June&blank;22,&blank;1994).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the Amendment 5 development and implementation period, fishing mortality rates increased and the downward
trends in stock size and yields continued. The recent stock assessment from the NEFSC (SAW 18) addresses the status
of Georges Bank cod and yellowtail flounder stocks and concludes that Amendment 5 is clearly inadequate to achieve
the reductions in fishing mortality rates needed to allow for appreciable stock rebuilding. Further, SAW 18 advises
that fishing mortality levels need to be reduced to as low a level as possible, approaching zero, in order to avert a
collapse of cod and improve the prospects of stock rebuilding for yellowtail flounder. This assessment coupled with
the severely depleted condition of the haddock stock and similar advice from the NEFSC (SAW 17) concerning Southern
New England yellowtail, presents an alarming picture of the overall status of the New England multispecies fishery.
Thus, even though the effort reductions required by Amendment 5 are very restrictive, they are insufficient. The
Council now intends to prevent an even worse scenario for the multispecies resource by severely reducing fishing
effort sooner and perhaps by more than what is required by Amendment 5.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council voted at its September 21&hyph;22, 1994 meeting to recommend that the Groundfish Committee (Committee)
immediately begin the development of an amendment to the FMP to implement the recommendations of SAWs 17 and 18 for
severely depleted groundfish stocks including Georges Bank yellowtail flounder, Southern New England yellowtail
flounder, haddock, Georges Bank cod, and others as needed. Also, the Council voted that the Committee needs to consider
all available options in meeting this objective while ensuring that in the Committee's analysis, consideration
of fishing effort displacement into other fisheries and other groundfish fisheries is taken into account. The range
of measures include, but is not limited to, a closure of all fisheries capable of catching multispecies and those fisheries
not protected from effort displacement resulting from this closure, a closure of very large areas in the Northwest
Atlantic for long periods of time, prohibitions or limitations on the use of specific gear types capable of catching
multispecies, selective gear requirements such as increased mesh size or square mesh, limits on total allowable
catch and/or individual vessel catch, and increased limits on vessel days at sea.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council expects that regulations sufficient to implement the recommendations of the NEFSC stock assessment
advisors will have significant economic and social impacts. The Council recognizes that these impacts will extend
beyond the individuals, families, and communities that principally depend on multispecies and will affect other
fisheries in the region due to the displacement of fishing effort caused by the regulations or through possible restrictions
on the incidental catch of multispecies in those other fisheries. For this reason the Council has determined that
it will prepare an SEIS.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 15, 1982, the FAA announced the adoption of Amendment 67&hyph;11 (47 FR 16298; April 15, 1982) to the FAR (14
CFR part 67). The amendment revised, among other things, the special discretionary procedures for issuing airman
medical certificates to persons who do not qualify for certification under &sect;&sect;67.13, 67.15, or 67.17 of
the FAR. In the preamble to that amendment, the FAA announced that, in compliance with Executive Order 12291, Federal
Regulation (February 17, 1981), it intended to conduct an overall review of the medical standards in part 67 of the
FAR. A complete review of the regulations was needed to bring the standards and procedures for airman medical certification
up to date with advances in medical knowledge, practice, and technology. Therefore, Amendment 67&hyph;11 was considered
interim clarification until a comprehensive review of the medical standards contained in part 67 could be concluded.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA began the review of the medical standards for airmen and of its certification practices and procedures (47
FR 30795; July 15, 1982) by requesting public comment. In addition, the FAA initiated a contract with the American
Medical Association (AMA) to provide professional and technical information. The AMA presented its report, ``Review
of Part 67 of the Federal Air Regulations and the Medical Certification of Civilian Airmen'' (AMA Report), on March
26, 1986. The public was again invited to comment on part 67 in ``Announcement of the Availability of a Report'' (51
FR 19040; May 23, 1986). The AMA Report detailed the results of a comprehensive review of the standards for airman medical
certification and of their application. The AMA Report considered pertinent advances in the field of medicine since
1959, recommended changes in FAA medical standards and explained the rationale for such changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a separate but related issue, on May 11, 1979, the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) petitioned to amend
&sect;61.23 to require medical examinations for private pilots at 36-month intervals rather than at 24-month intervals.
In response to the petition, the FAA reviewed the literature, surveyed the medical practices of the Department of
Defense, and considered a preliminary analysis of its own aeromedical certification data. The FAA then contracted
with Johns Hopkins University to prepare a detailed statistical analysis of information collected by the FAA from
annual examinations on approximately 31,000 air traffic controllers over a 15-year period. The study sample was
demographically similar and broadly comparable to the private pilot population, and the examinations were similar
to airman medical examinations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Johns Hopkins University analysis confirmed an increasing incidence of recorded pathology with increasing
age, agreeing with the data from the AMA report, but a relatively low incidence in young individuals. Reducing the
frequency of medical examinations could be expected to result in an increased prevalence of undetected pathology
within the system. For the younger age groups, however, this effect would be small. The Johns Hopkins analysis did
not identify exact ages at which the frequency of examinations should be changed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the AOPA petition to amend &sect;61.23, the FAA issued on October 29, 1982, NPRM No. 82&hyph;15 (47 FR
54414, December 2, 1982) proposing to amend part 61 to revise the duration of validity of third-class privileges of
airman medical certificates for operations requiring a private or student pilot certificate. As proposed by Notice
No. 82&hyph;15, the requirement for a third-class medical examination would have been changed to every 5 years for
the youngest pilots then increasing in frequency to the existing 2-year interval for older pilots. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 27, 1985, prior to the issuance of the AMA Report on its review of the airman medical standards and certification
procedures in part 67, the notice proposing to amend part 61 to revise the duration of third-class airman medical certificates
was withdrawn (50 FR 39619). The proposal was withdrawn, in part, because of issues raised by the medical community.
In addition, a regulatory evaluation of Notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No. 82&hyph;15 suggested a slight increase in aircraft accident fatalities if the then proposed third-class medical
certificate was set to 5 years for young airmen. Given the then pending issuance of the AMA Report and the possibility
that the report would provide better data on which to base an evaluation of the safety concerns raised by the medical
community, the FAA decided that any future consideration of examination frequency would be within the context of
the outcome of the comprehensive review of part 67. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 26, 1986, AOPA again petitioned the FAA to revise the duration of a third-class airman medical certificate
to 36 calendar months for noncommercial operations requiring a private, recreational, or student pilot certificate.
The petition (Docket No. 24932) was entered in the public docket and remains open. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 24, 1993, AOPA once again petitioned the FAA to revise the duration of a third-class airman medical certificate
to 48 calendar months for a specific trial period for noncommercial operations requiring a private or student pilot
certificate. The petition (Docket No. 27473) was entered in the public docket and remains open. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the FAA's review of part 67, the FAA's judgment regarding recommendations contained in the AMA Report, and
on consideration of all public comments in response to previous notices, the FAA proposes to revise part 67, ``Medical
Standards and Certification.'' The proposed revision of part 67 will involve the incorporation of additions and
changes to specific medical standards, the scope of examination, and the administrative procedures pertaining
to airman medical certification. In consideration of pertinent advances in the field of medicine since the last significant
revision of part 67, the medical standards and certification procedures that are being proposed reflect current
medical knowledge, technology, and practice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated in the notice withdrawing Notice 82&hyph;15, the duration of airman medical certificates was to be reconsidered
after the AMA's report; however, the report provided no duration recommendation. The proposal to revise airmen standards
and certifications procedures and the duration of airmen medical certificates was also addressed in a January 1992
agency rulemaking review. The results of these events supported the revision of part 67 and duration of third-class
airman medical certificates. A reevaluation of all studies and data collected since 1982 supports a revision of the
duration of third-class medical certificates outlined in this proposal. Accordingly, the FAA is proposing revisions
to part 67 and to &sect;61.23 of part 61 of the FAR.

Summary of Proposed Amendments to Part 67 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following is a summary of the substantive changes proposed in this rulemaking. Because the FAA is proposing a complete
recodification of part 67, this summary states both the current and proposed section/paragraph numbers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Distant visual acuity requirements for first- and second-class certification are changed to delete the uncorrected
acuity standards. However, each eye must be corrected to 20/20 as in the current standard. [FAR Standards: Current
&sect;&sect;67.13(b) and 67.15(b); Proposed &sect;&sect;67.103(a) and 67.203(a)] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. For third-class certification, the current 20/50, uncorrected, or 20/30, corrected, distant visual acuity standard
is changed to 20/40 in each eye, with or without correction. [FAR Standard: Current &sect;67.17(b); Proposed &sect;67.303(a)]

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. For first- and second-class certification, minimum near visual acuity requirements are specified in terms of
Snellen equivalents (20/40), corrected or uncorrected, each eye, at 16 inches and, after age 50, also include an intermediate
standard (20/40) at 32 inches. This replaces the current standard of V=1.00 at 18 inches for first-class only. [FAR
Standards: Current &sect;&sect;67.13(b) and 67.15(b); Proposed &sect;&sect;67.103(b) and 67.203(b)] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. A near visual acuity standard of 
<!-- PJG 0320 forcenewline -->
20/40, corrected or uncorrected, each eye, at 16 inches is added to the third-class visual requirements. [FAR Standard:
Current (None); Proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;67.303(b)] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Color vision requirements are amended to read: ``ability to perceive those colors necessary for safe performance
of airman duties,'' and are the same for all classes. Current standards require ``normal color vision'' for first-class
and the ability to distinguish aviation signal colors for second- and third-class applicants. [FAR Standards: Current
&sect;&sect;67.13(b), 67.15(b), and 67.17(b); Proposed &sect;&sect;67.103(c), 67.203(c), and 67.303(c)] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The current first-class standard pertaining to pathological conditions of the eye or adnexa that interfere or
that may reasonably be expected to interfere with proper function is substituted in both the second- and third-class
standards for the current standards which specify, respectively, ``no pathology of the eye'' and ``no serious pathology
of the eye.'' [FAR Standards: Current &sect;&sect;67.15(b) and 67.17(b); Proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;&sect;67.203(e) and 67.303(d)]

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
7. The ``whispered voice test'' for hearing is deleted for all classes. Substituted are a conversational voice test
using both ears at 6 feet; an audiometric word (speech) discrimination test to a score of at least 70 percent obtained
in one ear or in a sound field environment; or pure tone audiometry according to a table of acceptable thresholds (ANSI
1969). The amended standards for hearing are the same for all classes. [FAR Standards: Current &sect;&sect;67.13(c),
67.15(c), and 67.17(c); Proposed &sect;&sect;67.105(a), 67.205(a), and 67.305(a)] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The standards pertaining to the ear, nose, mouth, pharynx, and larynx are revised to more general terms and related
to flying and speech communication. Specific references to the mastoid and eardrum are deleted. The current standard,
``No disturbance in equilibrium,'' is changed to, ``No ear disease or condition manifested by, or that may reasonably
be expected to be manifested by, vertigo or a disturbance of equilibrium.'' The amended standards are the same for
all classes. [FAR Standards: Current &sect;&sect;67.13(c), 67.15(c), and 67.17(c); Proposed &sect;&sect;67.105(b),
67.205(b), and 67.305(b)] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. ``Psychosis,'' as used in the proposed regulation, refers to ``a mental disorder in which the individual has manifested
psychotic symptoms or to a mental disorder in which an individual may reasonably be expected to manifest psychotic
symptoms.'' This alleviates some of the problems in interpreting the regulations created by changes in nomenclature
and classification of mental conditions found in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 3rd edition (DSM III). [FAR Standards: Current &sect;&sect;67.13(d), 67.15(d), and 67.17(d); Proposed &sect;&sect;67.107(a),
67.207(a), and 67.307(a)] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Substance dependence and substance abuse are defined and specified as disqualifying medical conditions. Substance
dependence is disqualifying unless there is clinical evidence, satisfactory to the Federal Air Surgeon, of recovery,
including sustained total abstinence from alcohol for not less than the preceding 2 years in the case of alcohol dependence.
In the case of other substance dependence, recovery would include sustained total abstinence from that substance
for not less than the preceding 5 years. Substance abuse, in the case of alcohol within the preceding 2 years and in the
case of other substances within the preceding 5 years, is disqualifying. Alcohol dependence and alcohol abuse are
included in the terms ``substance dependence'' and ``substance abuse'', respectively. [FAR Standards: Current
&sect;&sect;67.13(d), 67.15(d), and 67.17(d); Proposed &sect;&sect;67.107(a) and (b), 67.207(a) and (b), and
67.307(a) and (b)] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. ``Bipolar disorder'' is added as a specifically disqualifying condition. This corrects a regulatory problem
created by the change in nomenclature contained in DSM III. [FAR Standards: Current (None); Proposed &sect;&sect;67.107(a),
67.207(a), and 67.307(a)] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. The general mental standard is amended to add the word ``other'' before ``mental.'' The proposed revised standard
reads, ``No other personality disorder, neurosis, or other mental condition *&blank;*&blank;*.'' [FAR Standards:
Current &sect;&sect;67.13(d), 67.15(d), and 67.17(d); Proposed &sect;&sect;67.107(c), 67.207(c), and 67.307(c)]

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. ``A single seizure,'' and ``A transient loss of control of nervous system function(s) without satisfactory medical
explanation of the cause,'' are added as specifically disqualifying neurologic conditions. [FAR Standards: Current
(None); Proposed &sect;&sect;67.109(a), 67.209(a), and 67.309(a)] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. The word ``seizure,'' is substituted for ``convulsive.'' [FAR Standards: Current &sect;&sect;67.13(d), 67.15(d),
and 67.17(d); Proposed &sect;&sect;67.109(b), 67.209(b), and 67.309(b)] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. ``Cardiac valve replacement,'' ``permanent cardiac pacemaker implantation,'' and ``heart replacement''
are added as specifically disqualifying cardiovascular conditions for all classes of certification. [FAR Standards:
Current &sect;&sect;67.13(e), 67.15(e), and 67.17(e); Proposed &sect;&sect;67.111(a), 67.211(a), and 67.311(a)]

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. A requirement is added whereby all applicants for second-class airman medical certificates will be required
to have a routine resting electrocardiogram (ECG) at the first application after reaching age 35 and every 2 years
after reaching age 40. An ECG requirement currently exists for first-class applicants; however, first-class applicants
must have an annual ECG after reaching age 40. There is no requirement added for third-class. [FAR Standards: Current
&sect;67.13(e); Proposed &sect;&sect;67.111(d) and 67.211(d)] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. The current table of age-related maximum blood pressure readings for applicants for first-class certificates
and the reference to ``circulatory efficiency'' are deleted, and a requirement that average blood pressure while
sitting not exceed 150/95 millimeters of mercury is added for applicants of all classes. A medical assessment is specified
for all applicants who need or use antihypertensive medication to control blood pressure. [FAR Standards: Current
&sect;67.13(e); Proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;&sect;67.111(b), 67.211(b), and 67.311(b)] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18. For first-class applicants only, a total blood cholesterol determination after reaching age 50 is added. A cholesterol
of 300 milligrams per deciliter or more may require further evaluation although the applicant, if otherwise eligible,
is issued a medical certificate pending the results. [FAR Standard: Current (None); Proposed &sect;67.111(f)]

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
19. The use of anticoagulant medication is made specifically disqualifying for applicants of all classes. [FAR Standards:
Current (None); Proposed &sect;&sect;67.111(c), 67.211(c), and 67.311(c)] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20. Current &sect;67.19 of the FAR, Special Issue of Medical Certificates, is rewritten [Proposed FAR Standard:
&sect;67.401(a)] to provide for, at the discretion of the Federal Air Surgeon, an ``Authorization for Special Issuance
of Medical Certificate'' (Authorization), valid for a specified period of time. An individual who does not meet the
published standards of part 67 of the FAR may be issued a medical certificate of the appropriate class if he or she possesses
a valid Authorization. The duration of any certificate issued in accordance with proposed &sect;67.401 of the FAR
is for the period specified at the time of its issuance or until withdrawal of the Authorization upon which it is based.
A new Authorization is required after its expiration, and the applicant must show again that airman duties can be performed
without endangering air commerce. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed FAR Standard, &sect;67.401(b) also provides for a Statement of Demonstrated Ability (SODA) instead of
an Authorization. The SODA will be issued to applicants whose disqualifying conditions are static or nonprogressive
and who have been found capable of performing airman duties without endangering air commerce. The SODA authorizes
an aviation medical examiner to issue a certificate if the applicant is otherwise eligible.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;67.401(e) retains the language of current &sect;67.19(c) regarding consideration of the freedom
of a private pilot to accept reasonable risks to his or her own person or property that are not acceptable in the exercise
of commercial or airline transport pilot privileges, and consideration at the same time of the need to protect the
safety of persons and property in other aircraft and on the ground. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;67.401(f) adds language that explicitly provides that the Federal Air Surgeon may withdraw the Authorization
or SODA. An Authorization or SODA may be withdrawn at any time for (1) adverse change in medical condition, (2) failure
to comply with its provisions, (3) potential endangerment of public safety, (4) failure to provide medical information,
or (5) the making or causing to be made of a fraudulent or intentionally false statement or an incorrect statement in
support of a request for an Authorization or SODA or in any entry in any logbook, record or report that is kept, made,
or used to show compliance with any requirement for an Authorization or SODA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;67.401(i) allows a person to request that the Federal Air Surgeon review a decision to withdraw an
Authorization or SODA. The request for a review would have to be made within 60 days of the service or mailing of the letter
withdrawing the Authorization or SODA. The proposed review procedures would be on an expedited basis and would provide
an affected holder of an Authorization or SODA a full opportunity to respond to a withdrawal by submitting supporting
medical evidence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
21. Proposed &sect;67.403 amends current &sect;67.20 to provide for denial of an airman medical certificate if the
application for airman medical certificate is falsified. Though this consequence is implied, the current regulation
specifically provides only for revocation or suspension of certificates. Additionally, &sect;67.403 proposes
to deny or withdraw any Authorization or SODA where information provided to obtain it is false, whether the statement
was knowingly false or unknowingly incorrect. Finally, &sect;67.403(c) proposes that the making of an unknowingly
incorrect statement on an application for an airman medical certificate or on a request for an Authorization or SODA
is a basis for denial, revocation, withdrawal, or suspension of an airman medical certificate and the denial or withdrawal
of an Authorization or SODA. The making of an unknowingly incorrect statement is not a basis for revocation or suspension
of other types of certificates or ratings issued under the FAR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22. A new &sect;67.415 of the FAR is proposed to provide that the holder of any medical certificate that is suspended
or revoked shall, upon the Administrator's request, return it to the Administrator. The FAA practice always has been
to request return of the certificate in such circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
23. Where appropriate, changes are made to eliminate gender-specific pronouns, to replace ``applicant'' with ``person,''

Summary of Proposed Amendments to Part 61 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 61.3(c) of the FAR provides, with some exceptions, that no person may serve as pilot in command or in any other
capacity as a required pilot flight crewmember unless that person has in his or her personal possession an appropriate
current medical certificate issued under part 67 of the FAR. The medical standards for issuing first-, second-, and
third-class medical certificates are set forth in current &sect;&sect;67.13, 67.15, and 67.17, respectively.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 61.23 identifies the duration of validity and privileges of each class of medical certificate. Currently,
a first-class medical certificate is valid for 6 months for operations requiring an airline transport pilot certificate,
12 months for operations requiring only a commercial pilot certificate, and 24 months for operations requiring only
a private, recreational, or student pilot certificate. A second-class medical certificate is valid for 12 months
for operations requiring a commercial pilot or an air traffic control tower operator certificate and for 24 months
for operations requiring only a private, recreational, or student pilot certificate. A third-class medical certificate
currently is valid for 24 months for operations requiring a private, recreational, or student pilot certificate.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Using the John Hopkins University analysis (raw data originated from the FAA), airman certification data, and annualized
pilot exposure data, a decision model was prepared for the FAA that determined the best age-specific duration plan
for the third-class medical certificate population. We determined that the best plan would provide for maximum regulatory
relief without public safety decrement. For further discussion of duration analysis, see this docket's copy of the
regulatory evaluation at pages 25&hyph;26, 58&hyph;64, and 77&hyph;80. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Using the model and the decision criteria previously discussed, the FAA proposes to lengthen the validity period
of third-class airman medical certificates for most persons under the age of 40. Persons under age 40 would be required
to undergo a physical examination every 3 years for a third-class medical certificate. Third-class medical certificates
for persons age 40 but less than age 70 would continue to be valid for 2 years. Persons age 70 and older would be required
to undergo a physical examination every year when applying for a third-class medical certificate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These ages and examination periods were selected because they will allow no significant increase in undetected pathology
between required examinations. Regulatory and economic relief can be provided without a significant effect on aviation
safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that the frequency of routine examinations can be reduced in the case of younger airmen who are
less likely to suffer medical disability and who have undergone an initial examination and certification prior to
first solo flight. Those individuals manifesting conditions that represent a risk to safety will be denied certification
or, after individual evaluation, will be restricted in their flying activities or examined more thoroughly and frequently,
or both. Those individuals who meet the published medical standards but whose conditions require more frequent scrutiny
will, under the new amendment, be issued medical certificates with a validity of 2 years rather than the longer period
which they may otherwise be granted. With routine medical examination frequency increasing with age as proposed,
aviation safety will be maintained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both the AMA report and the Hopkins' analysis confirm the greater incidence of medical pathology in older persons.
FAA analysis also confirms that the incident of accidents generally increase with an increase in age. It is prudent,
therefore, to leave the current routine periodic examination requirement unchanged for persons age 40 but less than
age 70 and to increase the frequency of examination for persons age 70 and older. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All third-class airman medical certificates or third-class privileges of a first- or second-class medical certificate
issued prior to the effective date of a final rule will remain valid for 2 years from the date of issuance unless the validity
period has been otherwise limited by the FAA. The period of validity for all third-class airman medical certificates
or third-class privileges of a first- or second-class medical certificate issued on or after the date of a final rule
will be calculated according to the provisions of the final rule unless the validity period has been otherwise limited
by the FAA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the increased public responsibilities associated with commercial pilot privileges, the FAA does not
plan at this time to change the frequency of examinations for first- or second-class medical certificates for operations
requiring an airline transport pilot, commercial pilot, or air traffic control tower operator certificate. Similarly,
the agency does not plan now to revise the validity period of student pilot certificates, now 2 years as set forth in
&sect;61.19, though these are usually issued in combination with the third-class medical certificate. A student
pilot whose student pilot certificate has expired but whose third-class medical certificate remains valid, may
obtain a new student pilot certificate from an FAA operations inspector as provided in &sect;61.85(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 61.53 of the FAR provides that: ``No person may act as pilot in command, or in any other capacity as a required
pilot flight crewmember while he [or she] has a known medical deficiency, or increase of a known medical deficiency,
that would make him [or her] unable to meet the requirements for his [or her] current medical certificate.'' This amendment
does not change &sect;61.53, and the FAA continues to require airmen to comply with that rule. In reducing the frequency
of required periodic contacts with knowledgeable health professionals, self-monitoring and personal attention
to health become a more important part of the individual airman's responsibility for flight safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice also proposes to amend &sect;61.39 to require that applicants must possess at least a third-class medical
certificate or the third-class privileges of a first- or second-class medical certificate valid under proposed
&sect;61.23 in order to be eligible for a flight test for a certificate, or an aircraft or instrument rating. The proposal
amends &sect;69.39 to coincide with the duration changes in &sect;61.23, as discussed above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, the FAA developed its proposal through review of the literature, survey of the medical practices of
the Department of Defense, analysis of National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) accident data and its own aeromedical
certification data, consideration of the data developed by the Johns Hopkins University, and in consideration of
the part 67 proposal announced in this notice. The proposed examination spacing represents the agency's view of an
optimum schedule in terms of estimated detectable pathology in the airman population and of the burden of required
examinations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No change in the scope of required examinations was proposed by Notice 82&hyph;15, Duration of Medical Certificates.
Where an applicant for medical certification demonstrates by history or by findings that additional or more detailed
medical evaluation is required, current regulations permit the FAA to obtain it. The routine examination used for
many years has proven adequate for the identification of those airmen who should be further evaluated yet places only
minimum burden on that majority of persons who can be immediately certificated. Nevertheless, the FAA announced
and conducted a complete review of the standards for airman medical certification (47 FR 16298, April 15, 1982 and
47 FR 30795; July 15, 1982), and examination scope was one object of the review. The larger part of this notice announces
proposals related to standards and administrative procedures for airman medical certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
History of Medical Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Airman medical standards have been in effect for many years. The 1938 Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR parts 20 and
21, 1938) under the authority of the Air Commerce Act contained minimum requirements for the physical condition of
airmen. The early rules did not provide for the issuance of airman medical certificates. However, they did require
that an appropriate physical examination be given before a pilot could be tested for a pilot certificate. In 1942,
a system for the issuance of medical certificates was adopted that provided for the issuance of first-, second-, and
third-class medical certificates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Discretion in the issuance of medical certificates has always been a feature of the FAA medical certification system.
Over the years this feature has been modified but the basic provision for special issuance of a medical certificate
to a person who does not meet the required medical standards has remained. To be granted a special issuance, an airman
has had to demonstrate by operational experience, flight testing, special practical evaluation, or a special medical
evaluation that he or she can carry out the appropriate airman duties without endangering public safety during the
prescribed time period of the medical certificate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of specific changes to the medical standards took effect in 1959. Electrocardiographic examination was
required of first-class certificate applicants. The ECG is to demonstrate the absence of myocardial infarction
and to identify other cardiovascular conditions. A second amendment provided for additional medical standards
related to a person's general physical condition and nervous system. These revisions were based primarily on a study
conducted by the Flight Safety Foundation, Inc. (FSF). The study proposed that the existing certification criteria
be expanded to cover the following specific medical conditions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) An established diagnosis of diabetes requiring insulin or other hypoglycemic treatment agents; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A history of myocardial infarction or other evidence of coronary artery disease; and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A history of an established diagnosis of psychosis, severe psychoneurosis, severe personality abnormality,
epilepsy, chronic alcoholism or drug addiction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FSF position was that the existence of any of the above conditions was an appropriate basis for disqualification
for any class of medical certificate. The FSF based its recommendation on the belief, at that time, that medical prognostication
for these conditions was too imprecise to provide assurance that these conditions would not interfere with the safe
piloting of an aircraft. The FSF found that the likelihood of an occurrence of a partially or totally incapacitating
state directly related to these conditions was so great that an airman with one of these conditions posed a potential
hazard to flight safety. As a result of the FSF's recommendations, the procedures were amended to prohibit the granting
of special issuances to airmen with these conditions. The Federal Aviation Act of 1958, however, provided for the
granting of exemptions by the Administrator. In 1960, the FAA specified that the existing general exemption procedures
applied to the medical standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rapid developments in medical knowledge about the disqualifying conditions and the development of improved techniques
for prediction of their risk for incapacitation led the FAA shortly afterwards to grant exemptions, with appropriate
limitations, to many persons with these conditions. Though exemptions were available, requests from individuals
with severe manifestations of some conditions were denied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1971, the authority to grant or deny petitions for exemption from part 67 was delegated to the Federal Air Surgeon
(Amendment 11&hyph;11; 36 FR 3462; February 25, 1971). This revision was designed to reduce administrative processing
time and lower costs for the FAA in the granting of exemptions. The FAA granted over 3,000 medical exemptions in the
ensuing years. Overall, the safety record of airmen who were granted exemptions has been at least as good as that of
the general population of airmen who hold medical certificates issued under the medical standards.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1982, the FAA amended part 67 in several areas (47 FR 16298; April 15, 1982). First, any disqualifying condition
which previously required a formal petition for exemption was permitted to be considered for certification through
special issuance procedures. Second, the prerequisite agency administrative review and decision process leading
to eligibility for NTSB review of denial actions was streamlined. Third, authority was delegated to the Federal Air
Surgeon to place functional limitations on medical certificates. Fourth, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;67.19 was amended to state that the Federal Air Surgeon, in granting special issuances to applicants for private
pilot certificates, considers the freedom of these applicants to accept reasonable risks to their person or property
that are not acceptable in the exercise of commercial or airline transport privileges, and at the same time, considers
the need to protect the safety of persons and property in other aircraft and on the ground. Fifth, clarifying interim
cardiovascular standards were issued. Sixth, the alcoholism standard was revised to conform to the Comprehensive
Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Prevention, Treatment, and Rehabilitation Act of 1970. In addition to the amendments
to part 67, the preamble to the 1982 final rule announced that in accordance with Executive Order 12291, Federal Regulations,
the FAA would undertake an overall review of the medical standards in part 67. This total and comprehensive review
was described as a major rulemaking effort that would involve obtaining the views of the medical profession and all
other interested parties and result in significant revision of part 67.

Current Requirements_Medical Certification of Airmen 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Part 67 of the FAR provides for the issuance of three classes of medical certificates. A first-class medical certificate
is required to exercise the privileges of an airline transport pilot certificate. Second- and third-class medical
certificates are needed to exercise the privileges of commercial and private pilot certificates, respectively.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An applicant who is found to meet the appropriate medical standards, based on a medical examination and an evaluation
of the applicant's history and condition, is entitled to a medical certificate without restrictions or limitations
other than the prescribed limitation as to its duration. These medical standards are currently set forth in &sect;&sect;67.13,
67.15, and 67.17 (14 CFR part 67). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An applicant for a medical certificate who is unable to meet the standards in &sect;&sect;67.13, 67.15, or 67.17 may,
nevertheless, be issued a medical certificate. Procedures for granting special issuances or exemptions have always
been available, and, thus, the standards have never been ``absolutely disqualifying,'' in the sense that certification
is permanently denied all who do not meet the standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under &sect;67.19, ``Special issue of medical certificates,'' at the discretion of the Federal Air Surgeon, acting
on behalf of the Administrator under &sect;67.25 of the FAR, a special flight test, practical test, or medical evaluation
may be conducted to determine that, notwithstanding the applicant's inability to meet the applicable medical standard,
airman duties can be performed, with appropriate limitations or conditions, without endangering public safety.
If this determination can be made, a medical certificate may be issued with appropriate limitations to ensure safety.

Discussion of the Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA proposes to amend part 67 to incorporate additions and changes in the specific medical standards and scope
of examination and in the administrative procedures pertaining to airman medical certification. The FAA also proposes
to recodify and partly reorganize part 67 to improve readers' accessibility to specific standards and procedural
requirements. Additional changes are proposed to improve syntax and correct errors. Section and sub-section references
are adjusted as necessary to reflect additions, deletions, and reorganization. Because the proposed medical standards
are not meant to be exhaustive in naming all medical conditions that are disqualifying, the word ``includes'' rather
than the word ``are'' is used in each section of the medical standards. Disqualifying medical conditions are not limited
to those representative conditions listed in the proposed standards. Medical conditions may be identified during
an examination which are related to a specific medical category of a section in the proposed standards but are not specifically
named in the standards (e.g., respiratory malignancy). These medical conditions would be considered under the General
Medical Condition section of the medical standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal is based on the FAA's review of part 67, on the FAA's judgment regarding the AMA Report recommendations,
and on public comment relevant to those recommendations and to the standards generally. The following discussion
of the proposal presents under each subject heading a discussion of the current rule, the AMA recommendations, and
the proposed rule. Also included in this preamble is a response to the comments received on the review of part 67 (Docket
No. 23190). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Distant Visual Acuity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current standards for applicants for first- or second-class airman medical certificates require that the uncorrected
distant visual acuity be not poorer than 20/100 and the corrected acuity not poorer than 20/20 in each eye, separately.
Applicants for third-class certificates are required to meet a standard of distant visual acuity of 20/50 or better
in each eye, separately, without correction; or, if poorer than 20/50, a corrected distant visual acuity of 20/30.
For third-class airman medical certification there is no standard for minimum acceptable uncorrected distant visual
acuity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA practice for many years has been to grant any class certificate requested, regardless of uncorrected distant
acuity, if the required minimum vision is present or achieved through conventional corrective lenses (spectacles
or contact lenses), there is no evidence of significant eye pathology, and the person is otherwise eligible. For first-
and second-class certification, this has been accomplished through the special issuance process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thousands of airmen exercising airline transport pilot, commercial pilot, private pilot, student pilot, and air
traffic control tower operator certificates have demonstrated their ability to safely perform their jobs while
using corrective lenses for distant visual acuity that is poorer than 20/100 in each eye. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AMA Report recognizes that the uncorrected distant visual acuity standards for first- and second-class certification
may be too stringent and recommends that they be changed from 20/100 to 20/200 without offering a rationale for the
specific recommendation of 20/200. The FAA notes that this recommended standard is consistent, in part, with the
standards of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the AMA recommendation, in mid-1986, the agency simplified the procedure for special issuance of certification
in cases where the applicant for a first- or second-class certificate demonstrates uncorrected distant vision worse
than 20/100 but not worse than 20/200. AME's were given permission to evaluate applicants without further referral
to eye specialists or to the agency for decision. In the absence of significant eye pathology, the AME may, after telephone
coordination with the agency, issue any class certificate. Individuals whose distant vision is poorer than 20/200
can be granted certification only by the FAA, after evaluation by an eye specialist. The FAA has found through experience
that safety is not adversely affected by permitting medical certification at any level of uncorrected acuity. Little,
if any, disqualifying eye pathology is found through the special evaluations of applicants whose vision corrects
to acceptable levels, and AME's are able to identify those whose findings suggest the need for further examination
by specialists. Therefore, the FAA proposes under &sect;&sect;67.103(a) and 67.203(a) the deletion of the current
uncorrected acuity standard for first- and second-class certification, thereby administratively simplifying
the certification process and reducing costs to airmen and to the agency. The FAA intends, however, to retain the current
requirement for first- and second-class certification that distant visual acuity be, or correct to, not poorer than
20/20 in each eye separately. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For third-class certification the FAA proposes under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;67.303(a) that the standard be amended to require a distant visual acuity of not poorer than 20/40 in each eye,
separately, with or without correction. This amendment eliminates the confusing current minimum acuity standard
(20/30 if corrective lenses are used and 20/50 if not used) and is consistent with safety and with the standards commonly
used by state automobile driver licensing authorities. It also reflects the ICAO standards for private pilots, and
it includes the AMA Report recommendation for minimum distant visual acuity without correction.

Near Visual Acuity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current near visual acuity standard for first-class medical certification is expressed as ``*&blank;*&blank;*
at least v=1.00 at 18 inches with each eye separately, with or without corrective glasses.'' The near visual acuity
standard for second-class medical certification is based on the ability to pass a test showing that the applicant
can read official aeronautical maps. Currently the rules for third-class medical certification have no near visual
acuity requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The AMA Report recommends several revisions to the near visual acuity standards. The AMA Report points out that the
current vision terminology of first-class medical certification is antiquated and unfamiliar to most AME's and
ophthalmologists. The AMA also notes that the Near Vision Acuity Test Card, FAA Form 8500&hyph;1, contains letters
that are to be used at 16 inches while the current standards are established for 18 inches.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The AMA Report recommends the same near visual acuity standards for all three classes of medical certification: a
near vision of 20/40, Snellen equivalent, at 16 inches in each eye separately, with or without corrective lenses.
In addition, the AMA Report recommends, at age 50 or older, a near vision standard of 20/40, Snellen equivalent, at
both 16 inches and 32 inches in each eye separately, with or without corrective lenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional requirements are imposed after age 50 because, with age, the eye loses the ability to accommodate for close
viewing distances, a condition called ``presbyopia.'' The AMA Report states: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
It is important while piloting to be able to see clearly at close distances, as when looking at maps, and at intermediate
distances, as when viewing the instrument panel. This is especially important in night flying. Diminished intermediate
visual acuity due to presbyopia in an individual 50 years of age or older may be further compromised by bifocal correction.
Trifocal or progressive power lenses may be necessary for clear vision at distance, intermediate, and near. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The AMA Report recommends that the appropriate necessary corrective lenses must be worn while exercising the privileges
of the certificate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule at &sect;&sect;67.103(b) and 67.203(b) follows the AMA Report recommendations except that a standard
for intermediate visual acuity is not proposed for third-class medical certification (see proposed &sect;67.303(b)).
Also, the proposed rule would require only that the corrective lenses be available while exercising the privileges
of the certificate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA is not proposing an intermediate visual acuity standard for third-class certification in recognition of
the lower level of responsibility inherent in noncommercial flight operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal does not require that corrective lenses for near or intermediate visual acuity be worn during all flight
operations because this is a matter better left to the discretion of the pilot. FAA practice and the FAR currently permit
airmen to exercise their certificates when any required corrective lenses for near vision are in their possession.
This permits, at the airman's option, use of separate near and distance spectacles; contact lenses for distance with
the addition of spectacles for near; unifocal contact lenses that correct for both near and distance; bifocal spectacles;
or continuously variable focus spectacles. If the airman requires correction only for near vision, spectacles,
half-spectacles, or bifocal spectacles without power in the distance portion may be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From among these options, an airman should be able to choose his or her method of visual correction while piloting an
aircraft. A requirement that all airmen wear their correction for near vision while flying would significantly and,
in the absence of demonstrated problems, unnecessarily limit their choice of visual aids. The FAA has no evidence
that significant operational problems are occurring with the use of corrective lenses for near vision. Therefore,
the proposed requirement for corrected intermediate vision in older airmen can be met through possession of additional
spectacles of the appropriate power or by use of trifocal lenses or lenses of continuously variable focus, as desired.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Color Vision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current standards for first-class medical certification require ``normal color vision'' (&sect;67.13(b)(3));
second- and third-class certification require ``ability to distinguish aviation signal red, aviation signal green,
and white.'' (&sect;&sect;67.15(b)(5) and 67.17(b)(3)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In current practice, applicants for certification are tested by use of standard pseudoisochromatic plates or by
other approved devices. A passing score defines the applicant as not color deficient. Failure indicates a color deficiency
and requires that any certificate issued be limited, prohibiting flight at night or by color signal control. This
limitation can, however, be removed through the successful completion of a practical signal light test or of a medical
flight test, as appropriate for the class certificate sought and the level of aviation experience of the applicant.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Airmen are routinely granted second- or third-class medical certificates without restriction if they pass the signal
light test. When they have the experience required for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airline transport pilot certificate and pass the medical flight test, first-class certification is granted. An
experienced airman rarely fails a medical flight test given for deficient color vision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Safety is further enhanced by the thorough training and testing given airmen seeking authorization to pilot new aircraft.
Through use of actual aircraft or of simulators, instructors, check airmen, and flight inspectors have an opportunity
to identify and, if necessary, recommend restrictions for those individuals who encounter difficulty with color.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AMA Report states: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
*&blank;*&blank;* the hazard to aviation safety of anomalous color vision is not clear. No studies have shown that
color deficiency has been a direct cause of accidents. On the other hand, color is an important constituent of aircraft
devices such as instrument panel gauges and warning lights, and of airport landmarks, such as beacons and runway lights.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The AMA Report recommends that testing for color vision remain part of the routine periodic examination of airmen.
The suggested standards include the retention of ``normal color vision for first-class certification and ``ability
to distinguish aviation signal red, aviation signal green, and white'' for third-class certification. The AMA Report
suggests, however, that the standard for second-class certification be changed to that for first-class. The AMA
Report notes an increasing use of color in instrument displays for advanced aircraft but less frequent use of colored
signal lights in today's flight environment. Despite these diverging trends and the absence of accident data, prudence
dictates some continued concern for the color perception of airmen. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA, therefore, proposes at &sect;&sect;67.103(c), 67.203(c), and 67.303(c) that testing at the time of the
periodic medical examination be continued as recommended, but that the standard for all classes of certification
be, ``Ability to perceive those colors necessary for the safe performance of airman duties.'' The standard is consistent
with that of the ICAO and reflects the agency's experience and practice for many years. Tests, instructions, and scoring
criteria are provided to AME's in the ``Guide for Aviation Medical Examiners.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certification relative to deficient color vision ultimately is based on performance. It is appropriate, therefore,
that the standard be related to the job requirement and that it be the same for each class of medical certificate.

The current standard is worded differently for each class of certification but without significant difference of

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The AMA Report recommends for all three classes of certification the measurement of intraocular pressure after the
age of 40 to identify glaucoma. The basis for this recommendation is that glaucoma may appear in two forms. One, closed-angle
glaucoma, is acute, painful, and potentially impairing; the other, open-angle glaucoma, is subtle, painless, and
progressive. Either form can be destructive to vision. Since, in many cases, open-angle glaucoma is not noticed by
the individual until after permanent changes in visual fields have occurred, a search for it should be a part of any
routine health maintenance examination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current regulations have no standard for intraocular pressure, however, and the FAA is not proposing standards at
this time. While the recommendations of the AMA Report suggest that everyone might benefit from regular measurement
of intraocular pressure, the risk to flight safety appears minimal in comparison to the cost and difficulty of testing.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current standards for hearing are as follows: (1) for first-class medical certification the person must be able to
hear the whispered voice at 20 feet with each ear separately or demonstrate a hearing acuity of at least 50 percent of
normal in each ear as shown by a standard audiometer; (2) for second-class certification, the person must be able to
hear the whispered voice at 8 feet in each ear separately; and (3) for third-class certification, the person must be
able to hear the whispered voice at 3 feet in one ear. The use of the whispered voice has raised questions of accuracy
and validity in the aviation environment. Pure tone audiometry is considered a more scientific and accepted method
for determining hearing capabilities and for documenting changes in that capability over a period of time. The present
procedure, however, has served well in enabling AME's to identify for referral and evaluation those individuals
whose hearing acuity is less than normal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Testing accomplished by the AME serves as a screen to identify those individuals who should receive more specialized
initial and periodic future evaluations. Almost all hearing-impaired applicants, however, receive special issuance
of a certificate after documentation of their condition. Many undergo practical testing to determine their functional
aviation capabilities. In the absence of other significant pathologic conditions, the certification decision
regarding hearing relates only to the individual's ability to safely exercise airman privileges. Medical flight
tests are used frequently for this determination, and the subject may use hearing aids, if necessary. Though an airman
may regularly use a hearing aid for activities not involving flight, the normal aircraft communication equipment
may serve as well, and the agency does not, in such cases, mandate the wearing of an aid. Special issuance is possible,
especially for applicants for third-class medical certification, in the presence of total deafness. Restrictions
on the exercise of airman privileges are applied to maintain safety in cases of total or functionally significant
deafness, and agency experience demonstrates that these practices have been successful and appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AMA Report recommends that speech discrimination be the basic screening examination used for certification
for all three classes. If sound field or speech testing audiometry equipment is unavailable, pure tone audiometry
is offered as an alternative. Speech testing would be accomplished either binaurally or monaurally, while pure tone
audiometry would apply a ``better ear'' and ``poorer ear'' standard. The AMA Report suggests individual consideration
when an applicant fails the standard tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA agrees with the AMA Report that the standards for hearing and for testing should be the same for all classes of
medical certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, it is unlikely that equipment appropriate for speech discrimination testing, as proposed by the AMA Report,
will be available to all AME's. In keeping with the intention of the AMA Report and in the interest of cost, availability,
simplicity, and functional adequacy, the FAA believes and, therefore, proposes at &sect;&sect;67.105(a), 67.205(a),
and 67.305(a) that the basic screening test administered to all applicants be a spoken voice test. This test is included
as part of Hearing Requirement No. 1 and Hearing Requirement No. 2, Chapter 6._ Medical Requirements, Personnel Licensing,
International Standards and Recommended Practices, Annex 1 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation,
ICAO. It has been implemented in many countries and is easily described and administered. The conversational voice
test is not inconsistent with the AMA Report emphasis on speech discrimination. The proposed standards would require
that a person be able (1) to hear an average conversational voice in a quiet room, using both ears, at a distance of 6 feet;
(2) understand speech by audiometric speech discrimination testing to a score of at least 70 percent obtained in one
ear or in a sound field environment; or (3) provide acceptable results of pure tone audiometric testing in accordance
with a table that is provided in the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Audiometric speech discrimination or pure tone audiometric testing are proposed as alternatives or for the further
evaluation of individuals who show reduced hearing acuity in the conversational voice test. The proposed standard
would apply to the examination of applicants without use of their hearing aids. Need for these devices to meet the standard
suggests that a more detailed evaluation is appropriate before certification, and that special issuance with periodic
reevaluation may be necessary.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The AMA Report recommends, for all three classes, a change of the standard to specify, ``No acute or chronic disease
of the middle or internal ear that will cause acute paroxysms or unpredictable attacks of vertigo.'' Also, the AMA
Report recommends an additional standard that specifies, ``No disease or malformation of the oral cavity, pharynx,
or larynx that would interfere with clear and effective speech communication.'' All other standards in the current
rule would be deleted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the most part, the proposed rule at &sect;&sect;67.105(b), 67.205(b), and 67.305(b) follows the AMA Report recommendations.
It requires that there be no ``disease or condition of the middle or internal ear, nose, oral cavity, pharynx, or larynx''
that will interfere with or be aggravated by flying or that will interfere with clear and effective speech communication.
In addition, in the proposed rule at &sect;&sect;67.105(c), 67.205(c), and 67.305(c) there may be no disease or condition
that may involve vertigo or a disturbance of equilibrium. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current standards reflect specific concerns about infections of the ear and mastoid and the damage caused by such
infections to the ear drum and middle ear. The proposed standards more generally and properly address diseases, or
conditions of the ear, nose, or throat that may interfere with speech communication or equilibrium, factors that
are important for safety.

Mental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Mental disorders may adversely affect judgment and behavior in ways that create potential hazards in aviation. The
current standards for all three classes of airman medical certification, therefore, list certain psychiatric disorders
for which medical certification would be denied. The list was derived from the recommendations made by the Flight
Safety Foundation in 1959. These disorders are considered to constitute a definite hazard to safety in flight when
determined to be present in an airman by established medical history or by clinical diagnosis. As listed in the current
regulations, any of the following disorders is a cause for denial: (1) a personality disorder that manifests itself
in overt acts; (2) a psychosis; (3) alcoholism; and (4) drug dependence. In addition, the current standards provide
for denial of medical certification in the presence of any ``other personality disorder, neurosis, or mental condition
that the Federal Air Surgeon finds makes the applicant unable to safely perform the duties or exercise the privileges
of the airman certificate that he holds or for which he is applying; or may reasonably be expected, within two years
after the finding, to make him unable to perform those duties or exercise those privileges.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The mental standards have been well accepted by the public and by the medical community as practical and effective.
However, with publication of the authoritative reference, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
Third Edition (DSM III), changes in the diagnostic terminology and classification of mental disorders have caused
some confusion. Major illnesses, previously included in the category of ``psychosis,'' are separately described
in the DSM III and are, therefore, no longer considered by some others as covered under the term ``psychosis'' in the
FAR. Since these conditions are of concern in the context of airman medical certification and flight safety, the agency
must amend the mental standards to clarify the position of the FAA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AMA Report recommends amendment of the regulations to include a more extensive and specific list of disqualifying
mental disorders: substance abuse or dependence; schizophrenic disorders; paranoid disorders; psychotic disorders;
major affective disorders (including bipolar disorders and depression); anxiety disorders; dissociative disorders;
impulse disorders; disorders first evident in infancy, childhood, and adolescence; and organic brain syndrome.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule at &sect;&sect;67.107 (a) through (c), 67.207 (a) through (c), and 67.307 (a) through (c) would
include all of these disorders but would not specifically list them. The current and proposed mental standard lists
a psychosis as a disqualifying disorder. The proposed standard states that ``psychosis'' refers to ``a mental disorder
in which the individual has manifested psychotic symptoms or to a mental disorder in which an individual may reasonably
be expected to manifest psychotic symptoms.'' In this way, two types of persons would be disqualified under this standard:
those who have manifested psychotic symptoms; and those who have not had psychotic symptoms but whose mental condition
is one in which psychotic symptoms may reasonably be expected to develop. Psychotic symptoms are characterized by
a failure to maintain adequate contact with reality. The failure to maintain adequate contact with reality results
in or may reasonably be expected to result in the impairment of judgment, including bizarre, grossly disorganized
behavior; out of control behavior; delusions; or hallucinations. ``Psychosis'' would include schizophrenic disorders,
paranoid disorders, and other disorders such as mood disorders, that sometimes manifest psychotic symptoms. Also
included would be such conditions as schizotypal and borderline personality disorders. Other disqualifying disorders
listed in the AMA Report that are not specifically listed in the proposed rule, such as anxiety disorders and impulse
disorders, may be disqualifying under the general mental provisions of the regulations as they are now, depending
on the severity of the disorders. The particular circumstances of each individual history and medical condition
are considered by the FAA in determining whether such history or condition is disqualifying.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA also proposes, as recommended in the AMA Report, that bipolar disorder be added to the list of disqualifying
conditions. Previously called manic depressive psychosis, this common, major affective disorder now is separately
classified by DSM III and may include individuals who have manifested only mania. Bipolar disorder is not specifically
referenced in current part 67. In consideration of potential risk to flight safety, individuals with this diagnosis
are rarely granted certification. Those few individuals who are determined to be eligible for certification through
the special issuance provisions of the FAR must be followed closely for relapse and recurrence of symptoms. By including
the new terminology, the standards will clearly reflect the agency's concern about this disorder. (Discussion of
how a proposed disqualifying condition may affect a current medical certificate appears under ``Additional Standards
for Disqualification.'') 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Substance Abuse/Dependence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Additional proposed changes in the mental standards for airmen are influenced by DSM III nomenclature for conditions
involving dependence on or abuse of alcohol, drugs, or other chemical substances. Current regulations list as disqualifying
``alcoholism'' and ``drug dependence.'' The AMA Report points out that DSM III eliminates the term ``alcoholism''
and substitutes the diagnosis of ``substance dependence'' and ``substance abuse.'' As disqualifying conditions,
the AMA Report recommends ``substance abuse, substance dependence and related substance use disorders, including
but not limited to those associated with alcohol; barbiturates; other sedative/hypnotics; muscle relaxants; anxiolytics;
opioids; central nervous system stimulants such as cocaine and amphetamines; and hallucinogens such as phencyclidine,
cannabis, and volatile solvents and gases.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule differs from the AMA recommendations in that (1) ``barbiturates'' are not specified separately
since they would be included with ``sedatives and hypnotics;'' (2) the phrase ``and similarly acting sympathomimetics''
would be added to the grouping of ``cocaine'' and ``amphetamines;'' and (3) ``phencyclidine or similarly acting
arylcyclohexylamines,'' ``cannabis,'' and ``volatile solvents and gases'' are listed separately rather than
grouped under ``hallucinogens.'' Additionally, the phrase ``related substance use disorders,'' as proposed,
but not defined in the AMA Report, is not included in this proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed standard defines ``substance dependence'' and ``substance abuse.'' A medical history or clinical
diagnosis of ``substance dependence'' would disqualify a person for a medical certificate under the standards unless
there is evidence of recovery satisfactory to the Federal Air Surgeon. The proposed changes also are intended to provide
specific regulatory medical standards for excluding from aviation a person who, though not substance dependent,
has abused alcohol within the preceding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2 years or other substances within the preceding 5 years. These proposed standards respond to the AMA Report as well
as to national concerns about substance abuse. These standards would enhance the agency's ability to examine and
to exclude, where medically appropriate, those airmen who have abused a substance within the time frames stated above
or who have a medical history or a clinical diagnosis of substance dependence. The proposed mental standard retains,
however, current language that permits medical certification under the standards upon presentation of acceptable
evidence of recovery and a specified period of abstinence in the case of alcohol dependence. The proposed rule provides
that clinical evidence of recovery would include sustained total abstinence from alcohol for not less than the preceding
2 years in the case of alcohol dependence, and in the case of other substance dependence, sustained total abstinence
from the substance for not less than the preceding 5 years. The time periods for sustained total abstinence are based
on the AMA recommendations. Other factors considered in determining recovery include the natural history and severity
of the problem; the period of satisfactory recovery since manifestation of the problem; any treatment, as well as
any continuing requirements for treatment, and its nature; any current or recent psychiatric symptoms, aberrant
behavior, or psychiatric or other medical findings; the need for or use of chemical agents; any personality traits
or other recognized factors involving the risk of future recurrence of the problem or the risk of other adverse events;
the period of the person's abstinence from the substance or substances; the number of times treatment was sought and
relapse occurred; the quality of the final treatment effort; the presence of residual medical complications, especially
neurologic manifestations; progress in marital, social, vocational, and educational areas, as appropriate, since
rehabilitation began; commitment to rehabilitation by virtue of continuing contacts with social or professional
agencies, or both, and their opinions and recommendations; and the findings of recent psychiatric and psychologic
evaluations, if appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed definition of substance abuse includes two criteria (the first relates to alcohol, the second to other
substances) that state a person would be disqualified if he or she demonstrated recurrent use of a substance in situations
in which that use was physically hazardous. At least one of the uses would have to have taken place within the preceding
2 years in the case of alcohol or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5 years in the case of other substances. Under this criterion, use in physically hazardous situations need not involve
the same substance or substances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A third criterion states that a person who used a prohibited drug as that term is defined in part 121, appendix I of the
FAR would be disqualified. The prohibited drug use would have to have taken place within the preceding 5 years. ``Prohibited
drugs'' as defined in the FAR do not include all substances; however, ``substances'' as defined in this proposal do
include all prohibited drugs. Alcohol, for example, is a substance which may be abused but is not a prohibited drug
as that term is defined under appendix I of part 121. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A positive drug test result for a prohibited drug is one type of evidence of use. The FAA recognizes that the probative
value of a drug test result varies depending on several factors, including the type of test, circumstances under which
the test was conducted, and other corroborative evidence of drug use. The FAA considers a positive drug test conducted
under any rule or internal program of the Department of Transportation (such as the FAA program required by &sect;&sect;121.457
and 135.251 or any other Administration within DOT) to be compelling proof of the use of a prohibited drug for which
the drug test was positive.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to positive drug tests other than those conducted under rules or internal programs of the Department
of Transportation, the FAA would evaluate such test results and the surrounding circumstances on a case-by-case
basis to determine the weight to be accorded them. If one of these tests is positive for substance use, the individual
could be disqualified under the criteria used in the definition of substance abuse or substance dependence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A fourth substance abuse criterion states that an individual is medically disqualified if he or she misused a substance
that is found by the Federal Air Surgeon to make the person unable to safely perform the duties or exercise the privileges
of the airman certificate applied for or held; or may reasonably be expected, within 2 years after the finding, to make
the person unable to perform those duties or exercise those privileges. The finding of the Federal Air Surgeon is based
on the case history and appropriate, qualified medical judgment. Again, as in the two previous criteria the misuse
must have taken place within the preceding 2 years in the case of alcohol or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5 years in the case of other substances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with the current regulation, certification before completion of the 2- or 5-year abstinence/recovery period
is possible under the special issuance provisions of the FAR if an individual evaluation demonstrates that the applicant
is able to perform airman duties without endangering public safety.

Neurological Conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current regulations on neurological conditions list as disqualifying for all three classes anyone with a history
or clinical diagnosis of epilepsy or disturbance of consciousness without satisfactory medical explanation of
cause. Nor may a person have any other convulsive disorder, disturbance of consciousness, or neurological condition
that the Federal Air Surgeon finds makes the person unable to perform airman privileges safely, or may reasonably
be expected, within 2 years after the finding to make the airman unable to perform airman privileges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A detailed discussion of neurological conditions, their evaluation, and prognosis is provided within the AMA Report.
Additional information and recommendations are contained in ``Neurological and Neurosurgical Conditions Associated
with Aviation Safety,'' a major report prepared in 1979 by representatives of the American Academy of Neurology and
the American Association of Neurological Surgeons through an earlier contract between the FAA and the AMA. Neither
report proposes detailed, objective criteria and tests that could be included in the standards and by which medical
certification could be determined. They discuss the medical techniques now available for evaluation of individual
airmen and the significance of the results obtained from their use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both reports emphasize the significance of seizure disorders. The few changes to the standards suggested by the AMA
Report are proposed by the FAA at &sect;&sect;67.109, 67.209, and 67.309, for all three classes of airman medical
certificates and include the addition of ``a single seizure'' to the list of disqualifying conditions; the use of
``seizure'' rather than ``convulsive'' to describe disorders that may be found disqualifying by the Federal Air
Surgeon; and the addition of a ``transient loss of control of nervous system function(s) without satisfactory explanation
of the cause'' as a specific basis for disqualification. This last proposed addition clarifies the agency's aeromedical
concern about such events whether or not they are characterized as disturbances of consciousness. (Discussion of
how a proposed disqualifying condition may affect a current medical certificate appears under ``Additional Standards
for Disqualification.'') 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other neurological conditions described in the AMA Report, though of significance in questions of aeromedical certification,
are not proposed as separate standards. The proposed regulatory provisions provide an adequate medical basis for
assuring safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AMA Report recommended that an abbreviated mental examination of four questions be included in each airman medical
certification examination. If one or more responses are incorrect, the Mini-Mental Status Examination of Folstein,
Folstein and McHugh (Folstein) would be given. The FAA studied the feasibility of the AMA Report's recommendation.
It found that neither the AMA-recommended test nor the test by Folstein provides a useful screening device, alone
or in combination, for airman neurological status. There was an unacceptable incidence of false negatives. Additionally,
neither test, alone or in combination, provides predictors of any skills known to be relevant to piloting.

Cardiovascular Conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To meet its statutory responsibility to ensure public safety, on May 17, 1982 (47 FR 16298; April 15, 1982), the FAA
amended part 67 of the FAR in part to clarify the cardiovascular standards. This change codified FAA policy that individuals
with a history of coronary heart disease not be medically certificated for the exercise of airman privileges under
&sect;&sect;67.13, 67.15, or 67.17. These individuals would continue to be certificated through the discretionary
special issuance procedures after a separate determination that their disease no longer represents a risk to aviation
safety. During that rulemaking procedure, a number of commenters expressed the belief that the cardiovascular standards
for medical certification should be relaxed. Commenters also suggested that those standards be revised to set forth
more detailed, objective criteria and tests by which medical certification could be determined, and a group of concerned
pilots submitted a petition for rulemaking (to be discussed later in this document) that was intended to accomplish
such a revision. Many commenters contended that the standards failed to take into account the advances in medicine
that had occurred since part 67 was issued. The FAA announced that these issues would be addressed in its review of part
67.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly, the FAA specifically asked the committee of consultants assembled by the AMA to review the cardiovascular
standards in light of recent advances and current concepts in cardiovascular medicine. Further, the FAA asked the
physicians to develop suggestions for inclusion of diagnostic and prognostic techniques in the standards, if appropriate
and feasible. The final AMA Report, however, indicates that the group could not establish, in the standards, qualifications
for medical certification. Instead, the AMA Report suggests general retention of the current cardiovascular standards
and format with additions to further improve their utility for ensuring aviation safety. In the presence of known
cardiovascular disease, certification decisions still would require professional evaluation of multiple medical
factors rather than verification of the results of a test specified in the published standards. The individual airman
who fails to meet the published standards would continue to be considered in accordance with the discretionary special
issuance provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AMA Report does recommend a number of changes. Additional cardiac conditions are suggested for inclusion in the
standards as rendering an airman unqualified for certification; revised standards for acceptable blood pressure
are given; maximum levels of blood cholesterol are proposed for some commercial airmen; and routine periodic electrocardiography
for all airmen is recommended. Rather than changes to the standards, the AMA Report emphasizes the need for careful
evaluation of all applicants prior to certification. Where individuals are found either to have cardiovascular
disease or to have factors or findings indicative of increased risk, more exhaustive evaluations are suggested before
certification can be granted and before periodic renewal of certification. Recommendations for these evaluations
are included in the AMA Report and are generally consistent with long-standing FAA practice.

Coronary Heart Disease 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA proposes that the present standards pertaining to coronary heart disease and its manifestations remain unchanged.
As amended in 1982, these standards are clear and have provided a firm medical basis for denying airman privileges
to individuals with significant, active coronary heart disease who might endanger public safety. This condition
precludes routine airman medical certification because it is a documented cause of in-flight pilot incapacitation,
and it is progressive in nature. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA will continue to evaluate airmen who fail to meet this standard to determine their eligibility for a discretionary
special issuance of medical certification. Certification will be based upon acceptable evidence that the individual
has recovered and that his or her anatomic and physiologic cardiac status would justify the subsequent exercise of
airman privileges. Appropriate functional limitations of airman privileges may be applied, and periodic follow-up
medical reevaluations may be required to detect any relapse or progression of disease. This procedure protects the
public while providing a means of relief for those individuals whose heart disease has stabilized sufficiently to
pose an acceptable risk. Since adoption of the amendments in 1982, an increasing number of airmen have been found eligible
and granted certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Additional Standards for Disqualification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA also proposes additions to the standards in proposed paragraphs (a) (4), (5), and (6) of &sect;&sect;67.111,
67.211, and 67.311, providing that a history or clinical diagnosis of cardiac valve replacement, implantation of
a permanent cardiac pacemaker, or heart replacement would make the subject person unqualified for certification
under the standards. These amendments are consistent with the AMA Report and the opinions of agency consultants and
reflect the serious nature of each of the conditions. Among the agency's concerns are failure of prosthetic heart
valves, pacemaker malfunction or progression of underlying disease that has required artificial cardiac pacing,
organ rejection, or the complications of immunosuppression. While the FAA may determine that an airman with a history
or clinical diagnosis of any of these conditions may be granted a discretionary special issuance of certification,
such history would preclude certification until specialized medical evaluation confirms adequate recovery and
function and the absence of significant risk in terms of the aviation environment. Where special issuance of certification
is granted, the regulations will provide for periodic medical reevaluations, if appropriate, for subsequent certification.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed medical standards, a small number of airmen, who currently hold certificates as a result of an order
of the NTSB, would become disqualified from further medical certification because of the addition of specifically
disqualifying medical conditions. These airmen had been denied medical certification by the FAA under a current
general medical standard. Under the general medical standards, an individual is denied certification by the FAA
when he or she has a condition which the Federal Air Surgeon finds may reasonably be expected to make the individual
unable to safely perform pilot duties. For example, the FAA has denied certification to airmen who have had cardiac
valve replacement and the NTSB has ordered certification in some of these cases. Under the proposed standards a medical
history of cardiac valve replacement would be specifically disqualifying and those airmen would no longer be entitled
to certification. It is expected, however, that the possible certification of such individuals would be reviewed
under the Federal Air Surgeon's special issuance authority once the FAA evaluates the case and is satisfied with the
airman's condition since the NTSB ordered certification. Such a disposition of these cases would be consistent with
the FAA's practice after the 1982 amendment of the cardiovascular standards rendered several airmen disqualified
whose certification under the old medical standards had been ordered by the NTSB.

The AMA Report also suggests that certain other cardiac diagnoses be added to the standards as specific disqualifications.
FAA certification experience, however, has not indicated a need for regulatory change in cases of cardiomyopathy,
congenital heart disease, valvular heart disease or murmurs, pericarditis, or disturbances of heart rhythm or conduction.
The agency agrees with the AMA Report that these conditions pose a potential risk but has found that the existing standards
and procedures provide adequate opportunity for identification and evaluation of the affected airmen and a regulatory
basis for denial of airman privileges, if appropriate.

Electrocardiography 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current standards require that applicants for first-class medical certificates submit a resting, 12-lead ECG at
the time of their first examination after reaching age 35 and, annually, after reaching age 40. They must show by these
ECG's, ``an absence of myocardial infarction.'' An ECG made within the 90 days before an examination for a first-class
medical certificate is accepted as meeting the requirement. There now is no routine requirement for submission of
ECG's by applicants for second- or third-class medical certificates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AMA Report notes that it is well established that up to 20 percent of myocardial infarctions (``heart attacks'')
fail to produce symptoms that bring a person to a physician. The resting ECG often shows evidence of a prior myocardial
infarction and patterns of anatomic change and other abnormalities that are also associated with an increased risk
of coronary artery disease. The AMA Report adds that many of the most common alterations of cardiac conduction seen
on the routine ECG are not associated with symptoms or with easily discerned physical findings. Yet, each of these
electrocardiographic findings causes special concerns regarding medical certification and may result in recommendations
for additional assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AMA Cardiovascular Committee, in recognition of these facts, recommended that the requirement for electrocardiography
be modified in an effort to increase the assurance that significant cardiac disease in pilots will be detected. The
committee suggested that, in addition to the current requirement for first-class certificates, an ECG be made on
all applicants for medical certification at the time they first apply. These ECG's would serve as a valuable medical
baseline for future comparison. Further, the committee recommended that an ECG be made on applicants for second-class
medical certificates at ages 35 and 40 years and every 2 years thereafter, and on applicants for third-class certificates
at age 40 years and every 6 years thereafter. The committee also suggested that the standard be modified to include
the agency's concern for any clinically significant electrocardiographic abnormality rather than the current
limited specification of myocardial infarction alone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In proposed &sect;67.211(d), all applicants for second-class airman medical certification would be required to
submit ECG's at the first examination after reaching age 35 and, biennially, after reaching age 40. There is reciprocity
between the first- and second-class cardiovascular standards in satisfying the ``after reaching the 35th birthday''
and the ``after reaching the 40th birthday'' ECG requirements. For example, an application with an ECG that satisfies
the ``age 35'' ECG requirement for first-class medical certification also satisfies the ``age 35'' ECG requirement
of an application for second-class medical certification and vice versa. In the case of the ``after reaching the 40th
birthday'' ECG requirement, however, the time provisions of &sect;&sect;67.111(d)(3) and 67.211(d)(3), as discussed
below, are also required for reciprocity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed time provision for the ``after reaching the 40th birthday'' periodic ECG for first-class medical certification
requires that an applicant submit an ECG with the application unless, within the preceding 9 months, an ECG was provided
as part of an application for medical certification. That is, if an applicant has submitted an ECG as part of an application
for airman medical certification within 9 months of the current application, the applicant does not have to submit
another ECG for the current application. Thus, after reaching the 40th birthday, a person who maintains a first-class
medical certificate would be required to have an ECG at alternate applications or approximately every year. In a few
cases, it could be 1 year and 3 months between first-class ECG's. The time provision for the ``after reaching the 40th
birthday'' periodic ECG for second-class medical certification is the preceding 15 months. An applicant maintaining
a second-class medical certificate would be required to have an ECG at alternate applications or approximately every
2 years. In a few cases, it could be 2 years and 3 months between ECG's. The proposed requirement for first-class medical
certification allows more leeway than the current rule. An applicant with a first-class medical certificate could
wait up to 9 months and the ECG of the previous application for a first-class medical certificate would meet the requirement
for the succeeding application for a first-class medical certificate. An applicant with a second-class medical
certificate could wait up to 15 months and the ECG of the second-class medical certificate would meet the requirement
for the succeeding application for second-class medical certification. No ECG requirement is being proposed for
third-class medical certification.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To ensure the currency of an ECG, the FAA proposes in &sect;&sect;67.111(e) and 67.211(e) that if a person is required
to submit an ECG as part of an application for medical certification, it must be dated no earlier than 60 days before
the date of the application it is to accompany and must be performed and transmitted according to acceptable standards
and techniques. Of course, there is no requirement to submit an ECG with a current application for medical certification
if a previous ECG submitted as a part of an application for medical certification can satisfy any current ECG requirement.
Sixty days is a longer period than the 30 days recommended by the AMA Report but represents a reduction from the 90 days
now permitted. The agency recognizes that many ECG's are provided by employers or through private physicians other
than the AME, and a reasonable period, such as that proposed, is appropriate for the airman's convenience. Finally,
the FAA did not propose a baseline ECG be performed for either first- or second-class medical certificate applicants
because it had a negative cost analysis and the FAA considers the ECG after age 35 to serve as an adequate baseline ECG.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA also proposes to amend the wording of the standard to require that the affected person ``demonstrate an absence
of myocardial infarction and other clinically significant abnormality on electrocardiographic examination.''
The FAA will continue to require electrocardiography or other appropriate evaluations for any airman whose medical
history or findings suggest it.

Blood Pressure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current medical standard pertaining to blood pressure applies only for first-class medical certificates. Depending
on the person's age and the scope of the examination accomplished, blood pressures from 140 to 170 mm Hg pressure, systolic,
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
88 to 100 mm Hg pressure, diastolic, are permitted. In practice, 170 mm Hg systolic and 100 mm Hg diastolic have been
considered the maximum allowable pressures for all applicants for second- and third-class certificates. The ICAO
standard provides only that the blood pressure of all airmen be ``within normal limits.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, &sect;67.13(e)(5) of the FAR provides that, ``if an applicant is at least 40 years of age, he must show
a degree of circulatory efficiency that is compatible with the safe operation of aircraft at high altitudes.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is rare for an applicant for certification to manifest hypertension (high blood pressure) at the level of the current
standard or above. Current and accepted medical practice for several years has reflected knowledge of the adverse
effects of even mild elevations of blood pressure and treatment is prescribed for most individuals at levels of blood
pressure much lower than the FAA standard for medical certification. If any person is taking medication for hypertension,
FAA practice is to consider the condition as coming under the provisions of present &sect;67.13(f)(2), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General medical condition, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
of the FAR. This section directs that the applicant have ``no other organic, functional, or structural disease, defect,
or limitation that the Federal Air Surgeon finds makes the applicant unable to safely perform the duties or exercise
the privileges of the airman certificate that he holds or for which he is applying; or may be reasonably expected, within
2 years after the finding, to make him unable to perform those duties or exercise those privileges; *&blank;*&blank;*''
Certification is conditioned on the findings of a more detailed medical evaluation, including an assessment of cardiovascular
risk factors, the presence or absence of disease of ``target'' organs, the degree of blood pressure control, and of
the medication itself.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AMA Report recommends that the existing, outmoded standard for blood pressure be replaced. It suggests a sitting
blood pressure standard of 150 mm Hg pressure, systolic, and 95 mm Hg pressure, diastolic, for all pilots. It further
recommends that the systolic level never exceed 160 mm Hg, regardless of the diastolic blood pressure. The AMA Report
notes that its recommendations represent a somewhat less rigid standard for younger airmen and a more rigid standard
for older airmen. Less rigid standards for the younger airmen are appropriate in terms of safety. For older airmen
the more rigid standards respond to data demonstrating the adverse medical significance of the high level of blood
pressure permitted by the current standard.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA agrees that the existing standard relating to blood pressure is outmoded and does not reflect current medical
knowledge or practice. It also finds that current &sect;67.13(e)(5) is medically vague and does not serve a useful
purpose. Accordingly, it proposes that the provisions of &sect;67.13(e) (4) and (5) of the FAR, including the table,
be deleted and replaced by new standards (proposed &sect;&sect;67.111(b), 67.211(b), and 67.311(b)) applicable
to all classes of medical certificates. It proposes that average blood pressure while seated not exceed 150 mm Hg,
systolic, or 95 mm Hg, diastolic. For ease of application, the agency will not introduce into the standard the additional
suggestion that the systolic pressure never exceed 160 mm Hg. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed standard would require more extensive assessment of airmen who require or use antihypertensive medication.
To maintain first-class certification, the assessment will be required at least at annual intervals, usually with
every other application. For second- and third-class certification, valid for 1 year and 2 years, respectively,
the assessment will be required with each application. Unless otherwise determined by the FAA under the special issuance
provisions of the FAR, certificates will be valid for the normal periods and, in most cases, issued by the designated
AME if there are no adverse findings. These procedures are included in current FAA guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed amendment would clarify the FAA's concern for the cardiovascular risk represented by hypertension
and the agency's position that persons who are undergoing therapy for hypertension should be evaluated to assess
the degree of risk. Though these standards are being codified for the first time, this evaluation does not represent
a new practice.

Cholesterol 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently no cholesterol standards exist in the regulations. In consideration of the responsibility for public
safety held by airmen exercising pilot privileges in air transport operations, the FAA has partially accepted the
recommendations of the AMA Report that the level of blood cholesterol be determined as part of the examination for
medical certification. The Risk Factor Committee of the AMA that considered risk factors and qualifications for
flying suggested that serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels be determined for all applicants initially and
at 50 years of age. The Cardiovascular Committee of the AMA, however, recommended that a determination of serum cholesterol
be made only for 50-year old applicants for first- and second-class medical certificates who exercise airman duties
in single-pilot commercial operations. Both committees recommended further evaluation if a level greater than
300 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl) of total cholesterol is found. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA proposes (proposed &sect;67.111(f)) that total serum cholesterol be tested annually as part of the examination
of all applicants for first-class medical certification who have reached their 50th birthday. Unlike a single determination,
an annual requirement will assist the FAA in the identification of adverse trends in cardiovascular risk factors
as airmen age. Applicants whose cholesterol level is determined to exceed 300 mg/dl would be required to undergo an
additional cardiovascular evaluation to determine if significant disease is present, but issuance of a medical
certificate would not be withheld solely on the basis of the cholesterol level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA agrees with the AMA Report and with the National Institutes of Health regarding the importance of this risk
factor for disease and believes that the additional cost to the holders of first-class airman medical certificates
is justified by the more effective identification of disease. By limiting this requirement to first-class certificate
holders 50 years of age and older, public benefits are enhanced with minimum costs by targeting the population having
the greatest risk and greatest public responsibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA does not consider feasible the AMA Report recommendation that the serum cholesterol level requirement be
limited to persons who exercise airman duties in single-pilot commercial operations. Individual airmen frequently
perform in a variety of commercial operations or change from one type of operation to another. There are no regulatory
controls for limiting applicability of such a requirement to single-pilot commercial operations.

Hematocrit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Currently no standard exists in the FAA regulations for blood hematocrit. The AMA Report recommends that all applicants
at age 40, and periodically thereafter, demonstrate a hematocrit within the range of 32 to 55 percent. The requirement
is recommended because the ability of blood to transport oxygen effectively to tissues is dependent on adequate hemoglobin
concentration and on the ability of blood to perfuse organs. Abnormalities of this function can result in incapacitating
organ infarcts. Also, a number of significant medical conditions are often reflected in abnormalities of the blood.
Anemias of various etiology, organ malignancies, polycythemia, lung disease, hemoglobinopathies, coagulation
and thrombotic disorders, hematologic neoplasia, lymphomas, immunodeficiency syndromes, and other disorders
are included in the conditions that may be discovered through examination of the blood.

The FAA is not proposing to add new standards for blood hematocrit testing at this time. Hematocrit testing would impose
incremental costs on applicants for a first-class airman medical certificate and additional administrative costs
on the FAA. While the recommendations of the AMA Report suggest that hematocrit testing would result in detection
of certain adverse or potentially incapacitating medical conditions, the risk to flight safety appears minimal
in comparison to the cost of testing. The list of specific conditions that would disqualify a person is not proposed
for inclusion in the FAR because the conditions are already covered in the general medical standards.

Anticoagulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current regulations do not contain specific standards for anticoagulation. Under the general rules of current paragraphs
(f)(2) (i) and (ii) of &sect;&sect;67.13, 67.15, and 67.17, the FAA has denied routine certification of persons who
require medication for anticoagulation. The FAA does, however, grant special issuance to a limited number of airmen
who use this type of medication after extensive evaluations of the conditions requiring anticoagulation, the stability
of the airmen's treatment regimens, and the presence or absence of adverse side-effects. Periodic reevaluation
always is required for subsequent certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AMA Report recommends denial of routine medical certification for any person who uses an anticoagulant medication.
This recommendation is consistent with earlier medical reports such as the report of the Eighth Bethesda Conference
of the American College of Cardiology in 1975, the Report of a Working Party of the Cardiology Committee of the Royal
College of Physicians of London in 1978, The First United Kingdom Workshop in Aviation Cardiology in 1982, and The
Second United Kingdom Workshop in Aviation Cardiology in 1987, and with recommendations of some FAA medical consultants.
Based on its experience with airmen who are taking anticoagulant medication, the FAA believes that some individuals
who receive anticoagulant medications may be granted airman medical certification after careful evaluation of
their specific condition. Such certification represents an exception, however, and must be accomplished under
the special issuance provisions of the FAR, subject to appropriate, periodic medical reevaluation and possible
restrictions. To clarify this position and to meet the FAA's statutory responsibility to ensure public safety, the
FAA proposes (proposed &sect;67.111(c)) to add the use of anticoagulant medication to those conditions specified
in the FAR as disqualifying an individual for certification. (Discussion of how a proposed disqualifying condition
may affect a current medical certificate appears under ``Additional Standards for Disqualification.'')

Respiratory System

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current regulations do not contain specific standards pertaining to the respiratory system. The Respiratory System
Committee, in its section of the AMA Report, recommended that all airmen older than 40 years periodically demonstrate
the absence of severe lung disease through spirometry, a simple, non-invasive test available in the physician's
office. The committee stated its concerns for the danger to public safety represented by airmen with serious pulmonary
disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, infectious diseases
of the lung, hypoventilation syndromes, chronic interstitial lung disease, and disorders of the respiratory muscles
and bony thorax. Both judgment and the ability to perform complex tasks may be affected adversely by a reduction of
oxygen available to the brain (hypoxia) because of poor pulmonary function, and acute lung disease can cause hypoxia
without warning. Altitude itself affects pulmonary function, so careful assessment of pulmonary status is required
to prevent incapacitation during flight, according to the committee's report.

Tests that measure the actual levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the arterial blood are costly and not generally
available in the aviation medical examiner's office. Careful clinical assessment of respiratory function, including
medical history and physical examination ordinarily are used to separate those applicants requiring further evaluation
of their pulmonary status from those who do not. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA is not proposing to add a new requirement for routine spirometric testing at this time. Spirometric testing
would impose incremental costs on applicants for all classes of airman medical certificate and additional administrative
costs on the FAA. AME's would be required to purchase the equipment necessary to perform the examination. Under current
practice, individuals with potentially serious pulmonary disease are identified through existing procedures
and referred for further evaluation, including spirometric testing, of their pulmonary status to determine their
eligibility for medical certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AMA Report also recommends specifically disqualifying diseases and conditions of the respiratory system. These
would include severe lung disease, poorly controlled asthma, sleep disorders, pulmonary hypertension, pneumothorax,
pulmonary emboli, and carcinoma of the lung. The list of specific conditions that would disqualify a person is not
proposed for inclusion in the FAR because the conditions are already covered in the general medical standards.

Diabetes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its discussion of diabetes in the preamble to Amendment 67&hyph;11, the FAA stated that the Federal Air Surgeon
would continue to deny certification to individuals who have an established medical history or clinical diagnosis
of diabetes that is controlled by the use of insulin or another hypoglycemic drug (47 FR 16298, April 15, 1982). The
preamble further stated, ``If, in the future, information demonstrating that medical technology has advanced to
the point that diabetes can be controlled without significant risk of incapacitation from hypoglycemia or other
complications becomes available to the FAA, consideration for special issuance of a medical certificate under &sect;67.19
will be possible.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of the review of part 67, the AMA Report made recommendations concerning individuals seeking medical certification
who have an established history or clinical diagnosis of diabetes that is controlled by insulin or another hypoglycemic
drug. The AMA Report recommended that persons whose diabetes is adequately controlled with oral hypoglycemic drugs
and who show evidence of stability and freedom from adverse effects be considered for medical certification with
proper medical monitoring. The Endocrine Committee assembled by the AMA believes that the likelihood of incapacitation
from the effects of diabetes or its treatment with current oral hypoglycemic drugs, in those persons medically selected
and monitored, is very remote. The AMA Endocrine Committee recommends that absolute prohibitions of certification
of individuals requiring insulin for control of diabetes be continued. Informal surveys of agency medical consultants,
comments by interested medical practitioners, and review by the FAA medical staff indicate general agreement with
these findings and recommendations of the AMA Report. The more widespread use of technically advanced equipment
and procedures has made it possible for physicians to better select those persons who should be allowed to use, or continue
to use, oral drugs to control their disease. The increased use of simple equipment and tests for self-monitoring gives
the diabetic and the physician a more accurate and timely picture of a person's immediate condition as well as his or
her ability to control blood sugar over time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In view of the current consensus of the medical community, the FAA has determined that many individuals whose diabetes
is without complications and acceptably controlled by diet and oral drugs, with appropriate monitoring and other
conditions, can perform the duties authorized by their class of medical certificate without endangering public
safety. Accordingly, though no substantive rule change is proposed to current requirements in paragraph (f)(1)
of &sect;&sect;67.13, 67.15, and 67.17, the Federal Air Surgeon has determined that those persons who do not meet
the medical standard of the FAR because their diabetes requires oral hypoglycemic drugs will no longer be categorically
denied special issuance of airman medical certification.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In determining eligibility for medical certification under the special issuance provisions of the FAR, the Federal
Air Surgeon considers the natural history and severity of the problem, the period of satisfactory recovery since
manifestation of the problem, and any treatment, as well as any continuing requirements for treatment, and the nature
of treatment. For diabetics whose disease is controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents, additional factors that
may be considered include: the age of onset of diabetes; the documented degree and means of past and present diabetes
control; the presence or absence of adverse effects, including hypoglycemic episodes; the presence or absence of
other known risk factors; and the individual's willingness and ability to maintain strict control of his or her condition
and treatment and to cooperate with any monitoring plan required by the FAA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four physicians who served on the AMA Report's Endocrinology Committee subsequently submitted a letter stating
that they reconsidered their Committee's recommendation on diabetes. The recommendation of the Endocrine Committee
was to continue to disqualify diabetics who use insulin to control their disease. In their letter, the four physicians
stated that persons on insulin therapy should be allowed consideration for special issuance certification. Several
other physicians who commented on the AMA Report also supported certification of persons on insulin therapy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The issues raised by these commenters pertain to current FAA policy of not permitting special issuance consideration
for persons on insulin therapy. As recommended by the full AMA Committee, the FAA proposes to retain this policy but
remains open to a change in its policy should there be any new medical developments. The issue was thoroughly covered
by the full AMA Committee and its recommendation was made after deliberation and thorough discussion. The contra
recommendation of the four physicians who submitted a letter to the FAA was not subjected to the same process, nor did
their recommendation contain any acceptable procedure for identifying persons on insulin therapy who could be safely,
reliably, and practically certified through the special issuance process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a related matter, a summary of an American Diabetes Association (ADA) petition for rulemaking to review FAA rules
and policies regarding individuals with diabetes was recently published in the

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (56 FR 10383, March 12, 1991). Specifically, the ADA petitioned the FAA to amend FAR &sect;&sect;67.13, 67.15, 67.17,
and 67.19 to allow individuals with insulin-treated diabetes mellitus to be issued medical certificates on a case-by-case
basis. The ADA further requested the creation of an FAA-appointed medical task force to develop a medical protocol
capable of permitting meaningful case-by-case review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Docket No. 26493 was established to receive comments on the ADA petition. Since the comment period on the ADA petition
has closed but the subject of that petition is directly related to the part 67 review, additional comments on the diabetes-related
issues raised in the ADA petition may be submitted to the docket of this rulemaking. The FAA may dispose of the issues
raised in the ADA petition through this action at the final rule stage, or through the issuance of a separate disposition
of the ADA petition.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Musculoskeletal System Committee of the AMA recommends standards that would disqualify an applicant for medical
certification because of conditions such as quadriplegia, hemiplegia, hemiparesis, collagen disease, and vascular
disease. The FAA does not propose specifying these conditions as disqualifying since they are already covered by
current general medical standards (proposed &sect;&sect;67.115, 67.215, and 67.315).

Special Issuance of Medical Certificates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has used special issuance (waiver) provisions of &sect;67.19 (proposed &sect;67.401) for many years to grant
airman medical certification to acceptable applicants who do not meet the published standards. Prior to 1982, except
for applicants for air traffic control tower operator certificates, this authority was not available for airmen
with histories of certain psychiatric, neurological, cardiac, or endocrine conditions, and exemptions from the
regulations were required. Beginning in May 1982, however, airmen with a history or clinical diagnosis of any medical
condition could be granted discretionary medical certification through the special issuance provisions if it could
be determined that, notwithstanding the person's failure to meet the applicable medical standard, airman duties
could be performed, with appropriate limitations or conditions, without endangering public safety. Through special
issuance provisions, many airmen have returned to productive aviation careers and others to private flying after
recovery and rehabilitation from serious medical conditions without adverse impact on public safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consideration for the granting of a special issuance can be initiated in different ways. Currently, the FAA will often
consider an individual for a special issuance who does not meet the medical standards under part 67 without a formal
request to the agency from the individual. In some cases an individual who does not meet the medical standards under
part 67 will make a written request to the Federal Air Surgeon or to his or her authorized representative to be considered
for a grant of a special issuance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under current practice, a special issuance letter is issued advising an airman of the FAA's decision to grant the special
issuance of a medical certificate. The letter describes the provisions and conditions of a special issuance of medical
certification. Based on the letter and on the individual being otherwise eligible, the agency or examiner issues
a medical certificate to the individual. These procedures apply for a new application and for an application for recertification.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current &sect;67.19 provides that the Federal Air Surgeon may limit the duration of a medical certificate issued
under that section, condition the continued effect of a medical certificate on the results of subsequent medical
tests, examinations, or evaluations, impose any operational limitation needed for safety, or condition the continued
effect of a second- or third-class medical certificate on compliance with a statement of functional limitations
issued to the person in coordination with the Director of Flight Standards or the Director's designee. It is implicit
in this section that in the interests of public safety a finding of adverse change in the medical condition of the holder
would result in termination of the validity of the medical certificate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The validity of the special issuance letter, however, does not lapse until the FAA takes some affirmative action to
modify or terminate it. Similarly, once a medical certificate is issued pursuant to the special issuance provisions,
even if the FAA terminates the special issuance letter, it may be considered that the medical certificate itself does
not lapse until the original date of expiration, unless it is sooner suspended or revoked under the provisions of section
609 of the Federal Aviation Act. Long-standing agency practice in the case of adverse medical change has been to send
the holder a letter terminating the validity of the special issuance of medical certification and requesting the
return of any medical certificates held.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To ensure that the medical justification for the special issuance remains valid and the holder of the special issuance
undergoes the same type of periodic reevaluation as the holder of any medical certificate does, it is proposed that
the duration of an Authorization for Special Issuance of a Medical Certificate (Authorization) will be limited,
and a new request for that Authorization will be required upon expiration. In addition, when the FAA determines that
an Authorization should be withdrawn, the medical certificate issued pursuant to that Authorization will also expire,
in accordance with proposed &sect;67.401(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An Authorization is one of two types of special issuances and covers those medical conditions, such as coronary heart
disease, where the disease is progressive in nature. A Statement of Demonstrated Ability (SODA) is the second type
of special issuance. If a medical condition, such as the accidental loss of a limb or deficient color vision is static
and nonprogressive, the FAA issues a SODA to those applicants found able to perform airman duties without endangering
public safety. This document remains valid indefinitely and permits a designated AME to issue a medical certificate
of the specified class if the holder remains otherwise eligible. In the event of adverse change, certification is
withheld and the person referred to the FAA for a new determination of eligibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current &sect;67.19 (proposed &sect;67.401) refers only to the special issuance of medical certificates. The FAA
proposes to add specific reference to the two types of special issuance documents: An Authorization and a SODA. The
first document codifies the special issuance letter currently used to grant and describe the provisions of a special
issuance of medical certification, and the second codifies a document that has been in use for many years. The proposed
change explicitly connects the duration of any medical certificate issued to the validity of the document upon which
it is based and requires periodic requests for reissuance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA also proposes to add language (proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;67.401(f)) that explicitly provides that the Federal Air Surgeon may withdraw an Authorization or SODA when:
There is adverse change in the holder's medical condition; the holder fails to comply with a statement of functional
limitations or operational limitations issued as a condition of medical certification; the public safety would
be endangered by the holder's exercise of airman privileges; the holder fails to provide medical information reasonably
needed by the Federal Air Surgeon to determine continued eligibility for certification under the special issuance
provisions; or the holder makes or causes to be made a fraudulent or false statement or an incorrect statement in support
of his or her request or in any entry in any logbook, record, or report that is kept, made, or used, to show compliance
with any requirement for an Authorization or SODA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;67.401(i) would allow a person to request a review of a decision to withdraw an Authorization or SODA.
The holder of an Authorization or SODA that is withdrawn may request, within 60 days after the service or mailing of
a letter of withdrawal, that the Federal Air Surgeon provide for a review of the decision to withdraw. The review procedures
would provide the holder an opportunity to submit supporting evidence in his or her behalf, and to otherwise respond
to the decision to withdraw. The proposed procedures and timeframes in &sect;67.401(i) are intended to provide an
expeditious administrative review for the benefit of those persons affected by a decision to withdraw an Authorization
or SODA. The public is invited to comment on the proposed procedures for withdrawal of an Authorization or SODA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;67.401(j) implements the procedure by which the FAA will convert current special issuances to either
Authorizations or SODA's. All Authorizations will have an expiration date. The date will coincide with the expiration
date of the airman's medical certificate or a date as stipulated by the Federal Air Surgeon or his or her authorized
representative that relates to any medical test, report, or examination required as a condition of the special issuance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 67.20(a) (proposed &sect;67.403(a)) of the FAR provides the regulatory basis for enforcement action when
an applicant or airman falsifies a medical certification document. In current &sect;67.20(b), consequences for
violating paragraph (a) include suspension or revocation of all airman, ground instructor, and medical certificates
and ratings held by that person. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although present paragraph (a)(1) provides explicitly only for suspension or revocation for fraudulent or intentionally
false statements on any application for a medical certificate, the FAA has denied the medical certificate applied
for in such cases. If the FAA interpreted the current regulation narrowly, it would have to issue a medical certificate
and then revoke it in cases where the person has falsified the application. The proposed revision of these requirements
(proposed &sect;67.403) provides explicitly for denial of an application for medical certification, as well as
for suspension or revocation of all airman, ground instructor, and medical certificates and ratings held by that
person, if the person makes a fraudulent or intentionally false statement or entry on the application or other document
required to be kept, made, or used to show compliance with any requirement for any medical certificate under part 67.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new paragraph (c) has been added to proposed &sect;67.403 to allow the FAA the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
option
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of denying, suspending, or revoking an airman medical certificate if any incorrect statement or entry has been made,
even if the person did not knowingly make the incorrect statement or entry. Medical certification based on incorrect
medical data may be inappropriate in the light of the true data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;67.403 also prohibits fraudulent or intentionally false statements or incorrect statements or
entries in connection with any Authorization or SODA. In addition, proposed &sect;67.401, which sets out the procedures
for Authorizations and SODA's, specifically lists the making of a fraudulent or intentionally false statement or
an incorrect statement as grounds for withdrawal of an Authorization or SODA.

requested information to trigger a suspension, modification, or revocation of a medical certificate. Failure to
provide the requested information is sufficient cause for the Administrator to act. A new sentence would be added
to this section (&sect;67.413(b)) to make it clear that submission of requested information does not automatically
lead to issuance of a medical certificate. A determination by the Federal Air Surgeon that the person meets applicable
medical standards is needed before a certificate will be issued. The FAA also proposes to remove gender-specific
pronouns and to substitute the more appropriate word, ``physician'' for the word ``doctor.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 7, 1981, the Civil Pilots for Regulatory Reform (CPRR) filed a petition with the FAA Administrator (Docket
No. 22054; AVS&hyph;81&hyph;520&hyph;P). The petition took issue with two aspects of the airman medical certification
process. First, that the cardiovascular standards for first-, second-, and third-class medical certificates (paragraph
(e)(1) in &sect;&sect;67.13, 67.15, and 67.17; 1981), automatically disqualify an airman who has an established
history or clinical diagnosis of a myocardial infarction regardless of degree or recency. Second, that the only means
to regain medical certification is dependent on the sole discretion of the Federal Air Surgeon via an exemption under
part 11 of the FAR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CPRR petition proposes to modify a subparagraph of the 1981 cardiovascular standard which reads, ``No established
medical history or clinical diagnosis of myocardial infarction .&blank;.&blank;.,'' to read, ``No coronary artery
disease that makes the applicant unable to safely perform the duties or exercise the privileges of the airman certificate
that he holds or for which he is applying; or may reasonably be expected, within 2 years after the finding, to make him
unable to perform those duties or exercise those privileges; and the findings are based on the case history and appropriate,
qualified, medical judgment relating to the condition involved.'' The effect of the proposed change is that a history
of coronary artery disease would not, per se, disqualify an airman. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CPRR petition also proposes that the standards and tests used by the Federal Air Surgeon to recertificate pilots
who have sustained infarcts be published in regulatory form in an appendix to part 67, and that a pilot be granted appeal
rights to the NTSB in the event that an exemption is denied. Furthermore, the CPRR petition proposes that the medical
exemption procedures under part 11 be revised to provide a ``due process'' format for the exemption deliberation
under part 11. The format would include: (a) if the airman petitioner requests exemption under part 11 because of disqualification
under the cardiovascular standard, the airman is given a complete file, prior to the exemption panel meeting, of all
records, reports and other documents which the agency plans to consider in the ruling; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) the airman may attend and present evidence at the exemption panel meeting; (c) panel members must record their
individual position in the official record of the meeting; and (d) the agency must construct a record sufficient to
form a basis for review by the courts of appeal under the arbitrary and capricious standard of review.

FAA Response: The medical standards were revised in 1982 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(47 FR 16298; April 15, 1982). The revision eliminated the need for the time consuming and cumbersome exemption pathway
under part 11 for part 67 medical disqualification cases and opened up part 67 medical disqualification cases (including
cardiovascular cases) to special issuance procedures under &sect;67.19. Additionally, the 1982 rule change stated,
in the preamble, general and specific criteria that would be considered in the determination of a cardiovascular
special issuance. The 1982 change considerably reduces the administrative costs and processing time for special
issuance cases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In regard to the CPRR proposals to change the disqualifying statement on myocardial infarction and to allow for ``due
process'' and appeal, FAA review of part 67 has not led to such proposals. The disqualification for myocardial infarction
remains in the proposed rules. However, it is, and would continue to be, possible for an applicant with a history or
diagnosis of myocardial infarction to receive a medical certificate through the special issuance procedures if
further medical evaluation of the applicant shows that he or she is able to perform the privileges of an airman certificate
without endangering public safety. Any applicant who has been denied certification because he or she is unqualified
under the cardiovascular standards is notified of the procedures, standards, and tests required for special issuance
determination. Test results are reviewed and evaluated by medical specialists. Generally, in difficult cases or
those involving commercial pilots, a panel of cardiovascular specialists reviews the medical reports and other
required documentation, assesses the risks involved in accordance with its best medical judgment and advises if
it believes a special issuance is warranted. The procedures provide for a reasoned, objective determination based
on medical facts and judgment. The determination is not based on a hearing-type procedure in which subjective facts
are weighed. In any case, the proposed rule would allow for the same ``due process'' as under the present rule.

Discussion of Public Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA requested public comments on the review of part 67 in two separate notices. On July 15, 1982, the FAA announced
the review of the regulations and invited public comment (47 FR 30795). On May 23, 1986, the FAA announced the availability
of the AMA Report and invited public comment on recommendations in the report (51 FR 19040). A total of 211 comments
were received. Comments were submitted by pilots, pilot organizations, and physicians, including several AME's.
Most of the comments refer to the AMA Report recommendations, only some of which are proposed in this document for adoption.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following discussion of comments addresses only the main medical issues raised by commenters that are relevant
to this rulemaking document. It does not address comments on AMA recommendations that the FAA did not choose to adopt.
Some commenters recommended changes similar to those recommended in the CPRR petition and, since the FAA's position
on these issues has already been stated, it is not repeated below. While the following discussion addresses the main
medical issues raised by commenters, it is not intended to be an exhaustive discussion of all of the comments received
and considered by the FAA.

Comments Received on the Review of Part 67 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the first notice, the FAA received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
52 comments providing suggestions for the FAA to consider during its review of part 67. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Twenty commenters, including four physicians, comment on persons with diabetes. In general, the commenters argue
that diabetes is a disease that is well understood and easily monitored by a personal physician. Advances in treating
diabetes, such as home glucose monitoring and other tests, provide full control to a pilot of his/her illness. Several
pilots suggest that diabetes is readily containable with the appropriate medical care, and no significant physical
strain is placed on a diabetic pilot in providing continuous treatment of the illness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four commenters discuss the possible benefits of an electrocardiogram (ECG) in evaluating a person's medical situation.
One doctor who is also an AME recommends a chest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
X-ray as a preventive test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another physician explains that there are currently no standards for risk factors such as cholesterol, cigarette
smoking, and blood pressure. These all have links to heart disease and, as a result, should be closely examined. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three people, including two physicians, support closer testing of pilots for signs and effects of alcoholism. They
point out that alcohol abuse is a major cause of aviation accidents and should, therefore, be tested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nineteen people objected to the stringent medical standards for persons obtaining a third-class medical certificate
under &sect;67.17. They argue that these strict standards are too rigid for this class of flyers, who are generally
leisure and sports pilots and can not easily obtain a medical examination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) submitted a detailed section by section recommendation for revising
part 67 that was based on recommendations of a medical advisory panel of distinguished physicians that was convened
by AOPA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA considered all of these comments, including AOPA's section by section recommendations, during its review
of part 67. The FAA's proposed standards and policy on diabetes are discussed under the proposed rule portions of this
preamble. New ECG requirements are proposed in this notice. Assessment of risk factors such as cholesterol and blood
pressure is included and standards pertaining to alcoholism have been updated in the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule amends the standards for third-class medical certificates in light of recent technology and medical
knowledge. As noted in the discussion of the proposed rule, the standards for third-class medical certificates are
less stringent than those for first- and second-class certificates in recognition of the lower level of responsibility
inherent in noncommercial flight operations.

Comments Received on AMA Report Recommendations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most commenters were generally opposed to any AMA recommendations that involved a perceived strengthening of the
standards for airman medical certification. Only eight commenters generally favored the AMA recommendations,
some with suggestions for improving them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many of the opposing comments from pilots were based on their reading of an editorial about the AMA Report which appeared
in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Flying
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 magazine (Volume 113, November 1986, page 24) entitled ``What's Up, Doc?'' While the editorial was factually accurate,
it briefly summarized some of the recommendations and was primarily a subjective editorial opinion opposing certain
recommendations in the AMA Report.

Cost and Safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The most frequent comment from those who objected to the AMA Report recommendations is that the recommended changes
will result in a substantial increase in the cost of obtaining a medical certificate and that there are no accident
data to indicate a need for increasing medical standards and thereby medical certification costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FAA Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The review of part 67 was necessary to ensure that the standards reflect current medical technology and evolving knowledge
about conditions that could affect a pilot's ability to perform safely. For the most part, the proposed revisions
to part 67 are not a strengthening of the standards over current regulations and policy. They represent clarification,
codification of policy, and an updating of the current standards and practices. The proposed rule would make some
standards less stringent, such as the deletion of uncorrected distant visual acuity requirements and the revised
wording of those requirements pertaining to the eye, ear, nose, pharynx, and larynx. In other instances, additions
to the medical examination requirements such as the proposed new standards for blood pressure for second- and third-class
medical certification are clearly warranted. The FAA would be remiss in its responsibility for safety if it ignored
medical findings and advances that can better identify those individuals subject to incapacitation or deterioration
of performance. The estimated costs and benefits of this proposal are addressed in a Regulatory Evaluation Summary
later in this preamble and more fully in a full regulatory evaluation which is in the public docket.

Prevention vs. Safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters object to statements in the AMA Report that certain recommendations are based on concepts of preventive
medicine. These commenters say that the FAA's responsibility is to safety rather than to a system of healthier pilots.
According to these commenters, the purpose of the agency's medical examination is to determine if a pilot is able to
perform safely the privileges of the airman certificate, not whether the pilot is generally healthy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FAA Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA is not proposing to change the primary safety objective of the medical certification examination. Rather,
the proposed revisions to the standards embody what has been learned in the last 25 years about medical risk factors.
FAA's interest in risk assessment is directly related to its need to determine at the time of a medical examination
as much objective information as possible on the medical condition of the person being examined. This information
is directly relevant to FAA's need to determine the likelihood that the person being examined will remain medically
fit for the next 6 months, or 1 or 2 years, as applicable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AMA report is fully consistent with helping the FAA meet its statutory safety responsibilities. The AMA Report
notes that some of its recommendations include ``risk factor identification items.'' It further notes: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
These items add to the safety factor for which the examination is designed; they also increase the likelihood that
pilots who pay attention to these risk factors will be able to enjoy flying aircraft for more years. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The fact that the AMA Report mentions potential long term preventive health benefits that may accrue to the person
being examined in no way diminishes the importance of the short term health evaluation benefits that are of primary
concern to the FAA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters object to the AMA Report because they believe the recommendations are in the AMA's self interest.
According to these commenters, any proposed increase in requirements would serve to increase the cost of the medical
examination and thereby the income of doctors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FAA Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its consideration of the AMA Report, the FAA found no indication of self-serving motives. The AMA committees which
worked on developing the recommendations were made up of experienced and respected specialists in each area of medical
interest. Each committee did an in-depth and thorough analysis of the current standards in relation to advances in
medical knowledge and examination techniques and recommended, as appropriate, optimum standards for safety. The
FAA reviewed and considered these recommendations along with public comments (many from professionals in the field)
and advice from its own staff. Factors such as pilot performance, aircraft technology, and cost, in addition to general
safety were considered by the FAA in assessing each AMA recommendation. (A cost benefit analysis appears in the Regulatory
Evaluation portion of this preamble.) The FAA believes the proposed standards will benefit all airmen as well as the
general public.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters express concern that the AMA Report recommendations, if adopted, would lead to an increase of
denials and, therefore, an increase in requests for certification under the special issuance provisions of the FAR.
This in turn would lead to certification processing delays. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FAA Response:

The FAA does not anticipate that the proposed standards will significantly increase the internal FAA workload. The
potential for such an increase and the FAA's plans to meet the increase are discussed more fully in the regulatory evaluation.

that these proposals encourage and support aviation.

Alleged Discrimination Against Older Pilots 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters allege that the AMA recommendations discriminate against older pilots in favor of younger ones,
since many of the tests recommended become critical for pilots after the age of 40 or 50. Air transport pilots who commented
argue that, if adopted, the recommendations might prohibit some older and more experienced pilots from flying. According
to these commenters, older pilots represent a high percentage of the highly competent and seasoned professional
pilots. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FAA Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any medical standards necessarily have a greater effect on older persons since many disorders occur more frequently
with advancing age, especially after age 40. The FAA contracted with Johns Hopkins University to prepare a detailed
statistical analysis of computerized medical information collected by the FAA from examination of approximately
31,000 air traffic controllers over a 15-year period. The study sample was demographically comparable to the private
pilot population and the examinations were similar to airman medical examinations. The analysis shows that the incidence
of pathology recorded at periodic examinations increases with age; the prevalence of pathology in individuals over
the age of 50 was greater than in those under the age of 40. The AMA recommendations and the FAA proposed rule focus on
those disorders most likely to result in reduced performance or to incapacitate a pilot. They provide for more relevant,
more thorough, and more predictive evaluations after age 40 or 50, particularly for those persons seeking first-class
medical certification. Proposed changes in this category relate to vision; electrocardiograms; and blood cholesterol
determinations. The proposed standards will permit the identification of risk factors and encourage pilots to maintain
better control over those conditions which eventually could lead to disqualification. Those AMA recommendations
included in the FAA proposal should serve, in the long term, to increase the pool of experienced, professional, and
medically eligible pilots.

AME's or Private Physicians 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters raise issues about the role of AME's and the role of private physicians in the maintenance of a pilot's
health. Two flight instructor pilots state that mistrust exists between pilots and medical examiners caused by pilots'
fear of losing their medical certification and their careers as pilots. More stringent rules, as recommended by the
AMA, will increase pilots' concerns and mistrust. Commenters also believe that some of the recommendations concerning
family history, for example, should be the domain of a pilot's personal physician and that in some instances personal
physicians could supply the information required by the recommended standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FAA Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Both current and proposed standards permit the use of test results provided by personal physicians, such as ECG's
and X-rays. However, the historical and legal role of the AME as a designee of the FAA is to conduct a medical examination
to determine the fitness of the pilot to exercise the privileges of his or her certificate without endangering public
safety. The proposed standards in no way are intended to interfere with or replace a pilot's use of a personal physician.
Experience, however, indicates that the FAA's statutory responsibility to ensure that an airman is medically fit
to perform his or her duties cannot be delegated to any personal physician. The proposed changes, however, should
not affect the relationship between pilots and AME's.

Specific Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters object to one or more specific recommendations in the AMA Report. Objections to cardiovascular
and vision standards are the most frequent. Some of these commenters express concern that the recommended standards
will serve to discourage good health practices through fear of denial. For example, commenters who objected to the
AMA recommendation for a blood pressure standard particularly object to the AMA recommendation that an applicant
shall have no established medical history of use of antihypertensive medication within the last year. Commenters
who use antihypertensive medication said they would either stop taking the medication (which they need) or be denied.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FAA Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed standards do not specify that individuals using antihypertensive medication shall be denied certification.
If antihypertensive medication is used or is needed to meet the blood pressure requirement, a person may be issued
a certificate only after a current, satisfactory medical assessment, prescribed by the Federal Air Surgeon. In this
case as in some others, the FAA has not followed the AMA recommendation. However, the comments indicate a misunderstanding.
A medical history of a disqualifying condition, whatever that condition is, does not necessarily mean that a person
will be denied certification absolutely. It may mean that additional evaluation may be required before the FAA can
determine if certification is appropriate. This may require additional time and some expense for additional tests,
but, for most of the proposed standards, the added inconvenience is minimal compared to the improvement in safety.

Introduction

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three requirements pertain to economic impacts of regulatory changes to the FAR. First, Executive Order 12291 directs
Federal agencies to promulgate new regulations or modify existing regulations only if the potential benefits to
society outweigh the potential costs. Second, the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires agencies to analyze
the economic impact of regulatory changes on small entities. Finally, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) directs
agencies to assess the effects of regulatory changes on international trade. In conducting these analyses, the FAA
has determined that this rule:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) would generate benefits exceeding costs, and, thus, is not a major rule as defined by the Executive Order; (2) is
significant as defined in DOT's Policies and Procedures; and (3) would not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities; and (4) would not have an impact on international trade. These analyses, available in the
docket, are summarized below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Regulatory Evaluation Summary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The majority of the proposed amendments would have insignificant attributable costs with respect to the benefits
received. This evaluation does not address the minor proposed amendments such as changes in syntax, technical corrections,
reorganization, updating medical terminology, or adjustments to cross-references for conformance purposes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the evaluation attributes no significant costs or benefits to several other proposed amendments that
would add a specific disease or medical condition to the list of medical standards. Such additions do not necessarily
constitute a change in the standards. Current regulations include two open-ended (general) medical standards that
cover: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) any other personality disorder, neurosis, or mental condition *&blank;*&blank;*, or (2) any other organic,
functional, or structural disease, defect, or limitation *&blank;*&blank;* that the Federal Air Surgeon finds
would make, or may reasonably be expected to make, the applicant unable to perform the duties associated with the certificate.
Thus, the applicable medical standards are not limited to those actually listed in the regulation. As medical knowledge
and experience progress, the Federal Air Surgeon may find a previously unlisted disease or condition to be grounds
for withholding or restricting a medical certificate, so long as that finding is based on qualified medical judgment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed standards, a small number of airmen who currently hold certificates as a result of an order of the
NTSB would become disqualified from further medical certification because of the addition of specifically disqualifying
medical conditions. These airmen were denied medical certification by the FAA under the current general medical
standards. For example, the FAA has denied certification to airmen who have had cardiac valve replacement and the
NTSB has ordered certification in some of these cases. Under the proposed standards, a medical history of cardiac
valve replacement would be specifically disqualifying and those airmen would no longer be entitled to certification.
It is expected, however, that certification of the affected individuals would continue under the Federal Air Surgeon's
special issuance authority once the FAA evaluates the case and is satisfied that the airman's condition has not worsened
since the NTSB ordered certification. As such, the expected economic impact of the specifically disqualifying medical
conditions would be minor.

Costs and Benefits That Are Not Quantified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to summarizing the evaluation of the substantive proposals, it is important to note one category of costs and
one category of benefits that have not been quantified in this analysis. The evaluation does not explicitly quantify
the economic consequences to those individuals who would lose their pilot certificate privileges as a result of the
proposed additional medical tests or standards. Where such consequences are expected, the evaluation estimates
the numbers of persons who would be denied but does not attribute a cost to those actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is recognized that the denial of pilot privileges would mean the loss of a highly valued avocation for some individuals.
For others, it would actually result in the loss of primary livelihood. An accurate assessment of the economic valuation
of the denials that are projected under this proposed rule is beyond the scope of the evaluation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the same time, the evaluation also does not quantify the overwhelming personal health benefits, external to flight
safety, that would be afforded to those individuals whose medical conditions would be detected and whose treatment
would be enabled by the proposed tests and standards. On average, third-class medical certificate holders spend
only 0.7 percent of their time flying. The evaluation only quantifies the direct benefits of the proposed rule to reduced
aviation accidents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under existing regulations, the Federal Air Surgeon is charged to deny a certificate in those cases where a disease
or other physical or mental condition would make, or may be reasonably be expected to make, the applicant unable to
perform the duties associated with the certificate. Such findings are not capricious, but instead, are based on the
case history of the individual and on appropriate, qualified medical judgment.

Vision Proposals, All Classes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would institute additional vision tests and standards for all three classes. For first- and second-class
applicants age 50 and older, it would add a new standard (20/40 Snellen) and a new test for intermediate vision (32 inches).
Applicants for third-class medical certificates would be subject to a new standard (20/40 Snellen) and a new test
for near vision (16 inches). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The projected 10-year (1994&hyph;2003) costs of the intermediate vision proposal for first-class applicants are
$1.1 million in primary testing costs, $1.7 million in follow-up compliance costs (examinations and glasses) for
those persons not meeting the standard, $5,641 in direct processing costs for the expected 14 additional persons
who would be denied under the provision, totalling $2.8 million, with a 1993 present value of $2.0 million.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The projected 10-year costs of the intermediate vision proposal for second-class applicants are $462,887 in primary
testing costs, $2.2 million in follow-up compliance costs (examinations and glasses) for those persons not meeting
the standard, and $6,529 in direct processing costs for the expected 17 additional persons who would be denied under
the provision, totalling $2.7 million, with a 1993 present value of $1.8 million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The projected 10-year costs of the near vision proposal for third-class applicants are $2.8 million in primary testing
costs, $1.3 million in follow-up compliance costs (examinations and glasses) for those persons not meeting the standard,
and $131,340 in direct processing costs for the expected 339 additional persons who would be denied under the provision,
totalling $4.2 million, with a 1993 present value of $2.9 million. It is emphasized that the denials and costs associated
with the near vision proposal are not wholly attributable to the proposed amendment. Although this requirement does
not exist in current regulations, it has been in place administratively for some time. Thus, the associated costs
are being, and would continue to be, incurred without this proposed amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NTSB accident records were investigated for the periods from 1962 through 1989 for commercial flights and from 1982
through 1989 for general aviation (GA). For these periods, no accident was found where intermediate or near vision
deficiency was specifically determined to be the cause. As such, the FAA is not able to quantitatively ascribe the
benefits of the three proposed vision amendments based on historical accident analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notwithstanding the absence of documented accidents related to these three proposals, the FAA maintains that such
accidents may well have occurred and could continue to occur in the absence of the proposed amendments. The NTSB accident
analysis system may not document those cases where a near or intermediate vision problem caused or contributed to
accidents. Examples would include deviations from course or altitude, inaccurate monitoring of gauges and other
avionic displays, and incorrect setting of aeronautical parameters such as headings or radio frequencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the extent to which intermediate or near vision problems have caused such accidents is unknown, it is the FAA's
position that: (1) general aviation pilots require adequate near vision to read charts and checklists, and (2) commercial
pilots require adequate intermediate vision to properly monitor aircraft instruments. Although this evaluation
is not able to quantify the benefits of the proposed vision amendments, the FAA holds that the benefits would be significant
and would exceed the expected costs.

Electrocardiogram (ECG), Second-Class 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal would add a new requirement whereby applicants for second-class medical certificates would be required
to have a routine resting ECG at the first application after reaching age 35 and every 2 years after reaching age 40.
The projected ten-year costs of the provision are $25.5 million in primary testing costs, and $1.7 million of additional
testing and processing costs for those persons who would not meet the standard, including 178 persons who would be
denied, totalling $27.2 million, with a 1993 present value of $19.2 million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The projected benefits of this provision were based on a review of the related NTSB accident records. In the absence
of this proposal, commercial pilot, heart-related accidents over the 1994&hyph;2003 period are projected to consist
of: 2.64 deaths per year valued at $6.60 million, .14 serious injuries per year valued at $89,600, .14 minor injuries
per year valued at $322, and 2.06 damaged or destroyed (GA and commercial) airplanes per year valued at $169,360, totalling
$6,859,282 per year. The projected benefits of this provision over the ten-year study period are $68.6 million, with
a present value of $48.2 million. The FAA holds that the proposed amendment would meet or exceed the 40 percent effectiveness
level ($19.2 million cost / $48.2 million potential benefit) necessary to be cost beneficial.

Blood Pressure, Second-Class 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal would add a new requirement that the sitting blood pressure second-class medical certificate applicants
not exceed 150/95 millimeters of mercury. The projected ten-year costs of the provision are $1.8 million in primary
testing costs and $0.7 million of additional testing and processing costs for those persons who would not meet the
standard, including 32 persons who would be denied, totalling $2.5 million, with a 1993 present value of $1.7 million.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The projected benefits of this provision were based on the review of the related NTSB accident records. For second-class
(commercial pilots), only one general aviation accident was found where hypertension or stroke was specifically
listed as the cause. That accident caused one death and destroyed one aircraft. Based on that accident, commercial
pilot accidents related to hypertension or stroke are projected over the forecast period to equal: (1) .14 deaths
per year valued at $350,000 and (2) .14 destroyed airplanes per year valued at $10,920, totalling $360,920 annually.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the directly attributable pathologies, high blood pressure is also an associated risk factor for other
pathologies including cardiovascular disease and kidney failure. The exact impact of the proposed rule on preventing
accidents from these related diseases is not known but the FAA estimates that the magnitude of associated-disease
accident costs that would be averted by the proposed amendment is at least equal to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5 percent of the projected costs attributable to second-class cardiovascular accidents. Such potential benefits
would total $342,964 per year. The combined (direct and associated risk disease) potential benefits of the proposed
second-class blood pressure amendment over the ten-year study period are expected to total $7.0 million, with a 1993
present value of $4.9 million. The FAA holds that the proposed amendment would meet or exceed the 35 percent effectiveness
level ($1.7 million cost / $4.9 million potential benefit) necessary to be cost beneficial. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Blood Pressure, Third-Class 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal would add a new requirement that the sitting blood pressure of all applicants for third-class medical
certificates not exceed 150/95 millimeters of mercury. The projected ten-year costs of the provision are $2.8 million
in primary testing costs and $1.0 million of additional testing and processing costs for those persons who would not
meet the standard, including 48 persons who would be denied, totalling $3.8 million, with 1993 present value of $2.7
million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The projected benefits of this provision were based on a review of the related NTSB accident records for the period
1982 through 1989. For third-class certificate holders, 6 general aviation accidents were found where hypertension
or stroke was specifically listed as the cause. In the absence of this proposal, third-class accidents related to
hypertension or stroke are projected to equal .75 deaths per year valued at $1,875,000, .5 serious injuries per year
valued at $320,000, .13 minor injuries per year valued at $299, and .75 destroyed airplanes per year valued at $58,500,
totalling $2.3 million per year. Over the ten-year study period, the potential benefits would equal $22.5 million,
with a 1993 present value of $15.8 million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similar to the proposal for second-class, the proposed third-class blood pressure standard would also reduce those
accidents caused by the secondary pathologies where high blood pressure is an associated risk factor. However, the
magnitude of accidents directly caused by hypertension and stroke in third-class pilots is so large that an estimate
of these secondary benefits is unnecessary. The FAA holds that the proposed amendment would meet or exceed the 17 percent
effectiveness level ($2.7 million cost / $15.8 million potential benefit) necessary to be cost beneficial.

The proposal would add a new requirement whereby applicants for first-class medical certificates age 50 and over
would be tested and would be subject to a standard of 300 milligrams per deciliter. The projected ten-year costs of
the provision are $3.4 million in primary testing costs and $2.0 million of additional testing and processing costs
for those persons who would not meet the standard, including 81 persons who would be denied, totalling $5.4 million,
with a 1993 present value of $3.7 million.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A review of general aviation accidents from 1982 through 1989 found six accidents caused by heart attacks in air transport
pilots. These accidents resulted in seven deaths, one serious injury, and six destroyed airplanes. Parallel statistics
for commercial accidents (from 1962 through 1989) revealed 4 accidents with 95 deaths, 15 major injuries, 2 destroyed
commuter airplanes and 2 destroyed air transport planes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These statistics project an annual, cardiovascular-related accident cost of $2.0 million in damaged airplanes,
and $27.2 million in lost life and injury costs. Multiplying the total $29.2 million projected cost by 5 percent, to
estimate the likely proportion of these costs that would be averted by the proposed cholesterol test and standard,
results in a potential annual benefit estimate of $1.46 million. Accordingly, the ten-year benefits are projected
to be $14.6 million, with a 1993 present value of $10.3 million. The FAA projects that the expected minimum potential
benefits of the proposal ($10.3 million) would exceed the estimated cost ($3.7 million).

Part 61, Certificate Validity Period, Third-Class 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposal, persons under age 40 would generally only be required to undergo a physical examination every
3 years. Medical certificates for persons age 40 through 69 would continue to be valid for 2 years. Persons age 70 and
older would be required to undergo a physical examination every year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendment would reduce: (1) the projected years of pilot pathology exposure by an estimated 0.2 percent, (2) the
projected flight hours of pilot pathology exposure by some 4.1 percent, and (3) the projected number of third-class
medical examinations by 14.5 percent. Accordingly, it is expected that the proposed amendment would not induce any
costs to third-class applicants considered as a whole. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The evaluation does not specifically quantify the potential benefits from the expected minor reductions in pathology
exposure. The expected ten-year savings that would derive from the 14.5 percent reduction in examinations is projected
to total $23.7 million in direct testing and time costs (a 1993 present value of $16.5 million). With a projected benefit
of $16.5 million and no expected net costs, the FAA finds that this provision would be cost beneficial. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is noted that the provision would transfer costs and benefits across age groups. Third-class applicants younger
than 40 would take fewer examinations and would be expected to manifest a higher incident of undetected pathologies.
Conversely, the group of applicants age 70 and older would take more examinations and would exhibit fewer undetected
pathologies. However, the net effect would be a reduction in both examinations and pathologies, consistent with
Executive Order 12291 which requires that regulatory objectives be chosen to maximize the net benefits to society.

Regulatory Flexibility Determination

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily
or disproportionately burdened by Government regulations. The RFA requires a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
if a rule would have a significant economic impact, either detrimental or beneficial, on a substantial number of small
entities. FAA Order 2100.14A, Regulatory Flexibility Criteria and Guidance, provides threshold cost and small
entity size standards for complying with RFA review requirements in FAA rulemaking actions. After reviewing the
projected effects of the proposed rule in light of these standards, the FAA finds that the proposal would not have significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between
the national government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the reasons discussed in the preamble, and based on the findings in the Regulatory Evaluation and the International
Trade Impact Analysis, the FAA has determined that this proposed regulation is not major under Executive Order 12866.
In addition, the FAA certifies that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact, positive
or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. This
proposal is considered significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979).
An initial regulatory evaluation of the proposal, including a Regulatory Flexibility Determination and Trade Impact
Analysis, has been placed in the docket. A copy may be obtained by contacting the person identified under

Eye standards for a first-class airman medical certificate include, but are not limited to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Distant visual acuity of 20/20 or better in each eye separately with or without corrective lenses. If corrective
lenses (spectacles or contact lenses) are necessary for 20/20 vision, the person may be eligible only on the condition
that corrective lenses are worn while exercising the privileges of an airman certificate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Near vision of 20/40, Snellen equivalent, at 16 inches in each eye separately, with or without corrective lenses.
If age 50 or older, near vision of 20/40, Snellen equivalent, at both 16 inches and 32 inches in each eye separately,
with or without corrective lenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Ability to perceive those colors necessary for the safe performance of airman duties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Normal fields of vision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) No acute or chronic pathological condition of either eye or adnexa that interferes with the proper function of
an eye, that may reasonably be expected to progress to that degree, or that may reasonably be expected to be aggravated
by flying. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Bifoveal fixation and vergence-phoria relationship sufficient to prevent a break in fusion under conditions
that may reasonably be expected to occur in performing airman duties. Tests for the factors named in this paragraph
are not required except for persons found to have more than 1 prism diopter of hyperphoria, 6 prism diopters of esophoria,
or 6 prism diopters of exophoria. If any of these values are exceeded, the Federal Air Surgeon may require the person
to be examined by a qualified eye specialist to determine if there is bifoveal fixation and an adequate vergence-phoria
relationship. However, if otherwise eligible, the person is issued a medical certificate pending the results of
the examination.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Bifoveal fixation and vergence-phoria relationship sufficient to prevent a break in fusion under conditions
that may reasonably be expected to occur in performing airman duties. Tests for the factors named in this paragraph
are not required except for persons found to have more than 1 prism diopter of hyperphoria, 6 prism diopters of esophoria,
or 6 prism diopters of exophoria. If any of these values are exceeded, the Federal Air Surgeon may require the person
to be examined by a qualified eye specialist to determine if there is bifoveal fixation and an adequate vergence-phoria
relationship. However, if otherwise eligible, the person is issued a medical certificate pending the results of

Special issuance of medical certificates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) At the discretion of the Federal Air Surgeon, an Authorization for Special Issuance of a Medical Certificate (Authorization),
valid for a specified period, may be granted to a person who does not meet the provisions of subparts B, C, or D of this
part if the person shows to the satisfaction of the Federal Air Surgeon that the duties authorized by the class of medical
certificate applied for can be performed without endangering public safety during the period in which the Authorization
would be in force. The Federal Air Surgeon may authorize a special medical flight test, practical test, or medical
evaluation for this purpose. A medical certificate of the appropriate class may be issued to a person who does not meet
the provisions of subparts B, C, or D of this part if that person possesses a valid Authorization and is otherwise eligible.
An airman medical certificate issued in accordance with this section shall expire no later than the end of the validity
period or upon the withdrawal of the Authorization upon which it is based. At the end of its specified validity period,
for grant of a new Authorization, the person must again show to the satisfaction of the Federal Air Surgeon that the
duties authorized by the class of medical certificate applied for can be performed without endangering public safety
during the period in which the Authorization would be in force. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) At the discretion of the Federal Air Surgeon, a Statement of Demonstrated Ability (SODA) may be granted, instead
of an Authorization, to a person whose disqualifying condition is static or nonprogressive and who has been found
capable of performing airman duties without endangering public safety. A SODA does not expire and authorizes a designated
Aviation Medical Examiner to issue a medical certificate of a specified class if the examiner finds that the condition
described on its face has not adversely changed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) In granting an Authorization or a SODA, the Federal Air Surgeon may consider the person's operational experience
and any medical facts that may affect the ability of the person to perform airman duties including_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The combined effect on the person of failure to meet more than one requirement of this part and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The prognosis derived from professional consideration of all available information regarding the person. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) In granting an Authorization under this section, the Federal Air Surgeon specifies the class of medical certificate
authorized to be issued and may do any or all of the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Limit the duration of the Authorization; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Condition the granting of a new Authorization on the results of subsequent medical tests, examinations, or evaluations;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) State on the Authorization, and any certificate based upon it, any operational limitation needed for safety;
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Condition the continued effect of an Authorization, and any second- or third-class medical certificate based
upon it, on compliance with a statement of functional limitations issued to the person in coordination with the Director
of Flight Standards or the Director's designee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) In determining whether an Authorization or SODA should be granted to an applicant for a third-class medical certificate,
the Federal Air Surgeon considers the freedom of an airman, exercising the privileges of a private pilot certificate,
to accept reasonable risks to his or her person and property that are not acceptable in the exercise of commercial or
airline transport privileges, and, at the same time, considers the need to protect the safety of persons and property
in other aircraft and on the ground.

or SODA may request, in writing, that the Federal Air Surgeon provide for review of the decision to withdraw. The request
for review may be accompanied by supporting medical evidence; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Within 60 days of receipt of a request for review, a written final decision either affirming or reversing the decision
to withdraw will be issued; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A medical certificate rendered invalid pursuant to a withdrawal, in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section,
shall be surrendered to the Administrator upon request.

that person to furnish that information or to authorize any clinic, hospital, physician, or other person to release
to the Administrator all available information or records concerning that history. If the applicant or holder fails
to provide the requested medical information or history or to authorize the release so requested, the Administrator
may suspend, modify, or revoke all medical certificates the airman holds or may, in the case of an applicant, deny the
application for an airman medical certificate.

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposes to add Bayou Cocodrie National Wildlife Refuge to the list of
areas open for upland game and big game hunting in Louisiana along with pertinent refuge-specific regulations for
such activities. The Service has determined that such use will be compatible with the purposes for which the refuge
was established. The Service has further determined that this action is in accordance with the provisions of all applicable
laws, is consistent with principles of sound wildlife management, and is otherwise in the public interest by providing
additional recreational opportunities of a renewable natural resource.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 National wildlife refuges are generally closed to hunting and sport fishing until opened by rulemaking. The Secretary
of the Interior (Secretary) may open refuge areas to hunting and/or fishing upon a determination that such uses are
compatible with the purpose(s) for which the refuge was established, and that funds are available for development,
operation, and maintenance of a hunting or fishing program. The action must also be in accordance with provisions
of all laws applicable to the areas, must be consistent with the principles of sound wildlife management, and must
otherwise be in the public interest. This rulemaking proposes to open Bayou Cocodrie National Wildlife Refuge to
upland game (squirrel, rabbit, raccoon, opossum and coyote) and big game (white-tailed deer) hunting.

Statutory Authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966, as amended (NWRSAA) (16 U.S.C. 668dd), and the Refuge
Recreation Act of 1962 (RRA) (16 U.S.C. 460k) govern the administration and public use of national wildlife refuges.
Specifically, Section 4(d)(1)(A) of the NWRSAA authorizes the Secretary to permit the use of any areas within the
National Wildlife Refuge System (Refuge System) for any purpose, including but not limited to hunting, fishing,
public recreation and accommodations, and access, when he determines that such uses are compatible with the purposes
for which each refuge was established. The Service administers the Refuge System on behalf of the Secretary. The RRA
gives the Secretary additional authority to administer refuge areas within the Refuge System for public recreation
as an appropriate incidental or secondary use only to the extent that it is practicable and not inconsistent with the
primary purposes for which the refuges were established. In addition, prior to opening refuges to hunting or fishing
under this Act, the Secretary is required to determine that funds are available for the development, operation, and
maintenance of the permitted forms of recreation.

Opening Package 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In preparation for this opening, the refuge unit has included in its ``openings package'' for Regional review and
approval from the Washington Office the following documents: a hunting/fishing plan; an environmental assessment;
a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI); a Section 7 evaluation or statement, pursuant to the Endangered Species
Act, that these openings are not likely to adversely affect a listed species or critical habitat; a letter of concurrence
from the affected States; and refuge-specific regulations to administer the hunts. From a review of the totality
of these documents, the Secretary has determined that the opening of the Bayou Cocodrie National Wildlife Refuge
to upland game and big game hunting is compatible with the principles of sound wildlife management and will otherwise
be in the public interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the NWRSAA and the RRA, the Secretary has also determined that this opening for upland game and big
game hunting is compatible and consistent with the primary purposes for which the refuge was established, and that
funds are available to administer the programs. A brief description of the hunting program is as follows:

Bayou Cocodrie National Wildlife Refuge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Public Law 101&hyph;593, enacted by Congress on November 16, 1990, authorized the establishment of Bayou Cocodrie
National Wildlife Refuge (NWR). The refuge is located in Concordia Parish in east central Louisiana. It was established
to protect some of the last remaining, least disturbed bottomland hardwoods in the Mississippi River Delta. These
forested wetlands represent one of the most valuable and productive wildlife habitats in the southeastern United
States. The stated purposes found at 104 Stat. 2957 provide that the refuge purposes are (1) the conservation and enhancement
of wetlands; (2) the general wildlife management as a unit of the National Wildlife Refuge System, including management
for migratory birds; and (3) for fish and wildlife-oriented recreational activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Total refuge acreage is proposed at 17,269 acres, including an 11,230-acre core tract formerly owned by The Nature
Conservancy. The remaining 6,039 acres are adjacent, privately-owned tracts. Acquisition to date totals 9,805
acres of the core tract. The area offers attractive shallow-water feeding habitat for pintails and other dabbling
ducks such as mallards and blue-winged teal, and provides excellent habitat for resident game, including white-tailed
deer, turkeys, woodcock, and grey and fox squirrels. The bottomland hardwoods also serve as both permanent homes
and migration habitat for many species of passerine birds, including songbirds and neotropical migrants.

The area has historically been noted for its excellent hunting opportunities for white-tailed deer and small game
such as rabbits and squirrels. Nearly all of the refuge area was leased by hunting clubs or commercial hunting enterprises
prior to the government obtaining the property. Based on preliminary assessment of the refuge and the experience
of the local Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries biologist and enforcement personnel, all indications
support the fact that relevant wildlife populations are sufficient for hunting and for other refuge objectives.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the unpredictable refuge development timeframe, the location of future land purchases, and the limited
amount of developed waterfowl habitat, the initial hunting program will involve only resident game including white-tailed
deer, squirrels, and rabbits. A waterfowl hunting program is totally dependent on the capability of being able to
have dependable water sources to maintain optimum water levels for waterfowl hunting. Seasons and bag limits for
resident game seasons hunting will be within the guidelines established by the Louisiana Department of Wildlife
and Fisheries, but will likely be more conservative. The hunting program will be reviewed on an annual basis and revisions
will be made accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The sport hunting program will be monitored by refuge personnel. Currently, the refuge is operating at the ``custodial
level'' with only one staff member_the refuge manager. Resources from other refuges (Tensas River, Catahoula, and
Lake Ophelia) will be utilized to help administer the hunt programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To facilitate the distribution of news releases, the refuge will maintain a mailing list for newspapers, local radio
and television stations. News releases will be developed announcing the hunting season dates, where regulations
can be obtained, and other pertinent information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Opening the refuge to upland game and big game hunting has been found to be compatible in a separate compatibility determination.
This determination noted that time and zone restrictions would be implemented as land acquisition progressed to
ensure continued compatibility. A Section 7 evaluation pursuant to the Endangered Species Act was conducted and
it was determined that the proposed action is not likely to adversely affect any Federally listed or proposed for listing
threatened or endangered species or their critical habitats. Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act
(NEPA), an environmental assessment was made and a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) was made regarding the
hunt. Numerous contacts were made throughout the area of the refuge soliciting comments on the proposed hunting plan.
The Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries concurs and fully supports the regulated recreational hunting
program proposed at the refuge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has determined that there would be sufficient funds to administer the proposed hunt pursuant to the requirements
of the Refuge Recreation Act. The cost of the proposed hunt program is estimated to be approximately $25,000 for the
initial year and $10,000 per year thereafter. Sufficient funds would be available within the refuge unit budget to
operate such a hunt as proposed. It is estimated, further, that 10,000 hunter visits per year would take place.

This rulemaking was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866. In addition,
a review under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) has revealed that the rulemaking would
not have a significant effect on a substantial number of small entities, which include businesses, organizations
or governmental jurisdictions. This proposed rule would have minimal effect on such entities.

Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this rule does not have sufficient Federalism
implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
