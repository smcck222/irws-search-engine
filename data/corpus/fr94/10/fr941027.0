SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule temporarily suspends a sentence in &sect;989.67(j) of the California raisin marketing order dealing
with the pricing of reserve raisins offered to handlers for free use. The industry is faced with a large supply of Zante
Currant raisins. The suspension will only apply to 1994&hyph;95 reserve Zante Currants so that the value of a portion
of the free tonnage inventory held by handlers on July 31, 1994, can be adjusted downward toward current market price
levels. This adjustment is necessary to help the industry become price competitive and to aid it in marketing Zante
Currants. This action was unanimously recommended by the Raisin Administrative Committee (Committee), which is
responsible for local administration of the order.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 989 [7 CFR Part 989] (order), regulating the handling of
raisins produced from grapes grown in California. The order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement
Act of 1937, as amended, [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule will allow the Committee
to implement an inventory price adjustment program for Zante Currents during the 1994&hyph;95 crop year, which began
August 1, 1994. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an
irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After a hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 20 handlers of California raisins who are subject to regulation under the order, and approximately
5,000 producers in the regulated area. Small agricultural service firms have been defined by the Small Business Administration
[13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural producers are defined
as those whose annual receipts are less than $500,000. A minority of handlers and a majority of producers of California
raisins may be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the order, seasonal volume regulations can be established. The free percentages prescribe the portion of the
crop that can be shipped at any time to any market. The reserve percentages prescribe the portion of the crop that must
be held for delayed shipment. Reserve raisins are held in a reserve pool by handlers for the account of the Committee.
Funds generated from the sale of reserve pool raisins are distributed equally to equity holders (growers). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule will suspend the penultimate sentence in &sect;989.67(j) of the order for the 1994&hyph;95 crop year.
That sentence provides that: ``However, such raisins shall not be sold at a price below that which the committee concludes
reflects the average price received by producers for free tonnage of the same varietal type purchased by handlers
during the current crop year up to the time of any offer for sale of reserve tonnage by the committee, to which shall be
added the costs to the equity holders incurred by the committee on account of receiving, inspecting, storing, fumigating,
insuring, and holding of said raisins, and including costs of taxes and interest: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
That, where the outlook for the next crop year or other factors have caused a downward trend in the prices received by
producers for free tonnage raisins or in the prices received by handlers for free tonnage packed raisins, reserve
tonnage may be sold to handlers at the currently prevailing or the approximate computed field price for free tonnage
raisins, as determined by the committee.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Limited volumes of Zante Currants are produced in California. The 1993&hyph;94 California production of Zante Currants
was 5,643 tons, which is 32 percent larger than the prior four-year average of 4,279 tons. The estimated 1994&hyph;95
production is greater than 6,500 tons or over 50 percent more than the 1989&hyph;92 four-year average. It is anticipated
that the production of Zante Currants will continue to increase in the next one to three years as newly planted acreage
begins to produce and/or reach full production. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Greece is the major producer of currants, generally representing at least 85 percent of the annual world production
of such raisins. In 1992&hyph;93, Greek currants were in short supply and prices rose sharply. As a result, the market
for California Zante Currants strengthened significantly and the grower price increased to $1,600 from $1,365 per
ton the previous season. In 1993&hyph;94, the grower price for California Zante Currants was $1,200 per ton. The 1993&hyph;94
Greek currant crop was approximately 50,000 tons, of excellent quality, and prices were very competitive with those
quoted for California Zante Currants. This resulted in a significant drop in California Zante Currant shipments
here and abroad.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, the California raisin industry is carrying a very large supply (approximately 4,000 tons) of 1992&hyph;93
and 1993&hyph;94 crop Zante Currants and projects a record production (approximately 6,500 tons) in 1994&hyph;95.
The trade is aware of this supply problem and forward purchases from handlers have decreased. Sales are not expected
to increase until corrective pricing action is taken by handlers. Before that can begin, however, handlers need assurance
that the value of some of their free Zante Currant inventories from the 1992&hyph;93 and 1993&hyph;94 production
years can be reduced to the recently established $980 per ton 1994&hyph;95 free tonnage Zante Currant field price,
thus reducing their potential losses on existing free raisin inventory. Suspending the penultimate sentence in
&sect;989.67(j) can assure this protection, as it will allow the Committee to sell 1994 crop reserve tonnage to handlers
for free use at a lower price than the established field price. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee plans to offer handlers one ton of 1994&hyph;95 crop Zante Currant reserve raisins at $100 per ton for
every four tons of free Zante Currants held by them on July 31, 1994. Purchasing free tonnage 1994&hyph;95 crop Zante
Currants at $980 per ton and reserve Zante Currants at $100 per ton in accordance with this formula will allow handlers'
inventories to achieve an approximate net value of $980 per ton. In the absence of the suspension, these price adjustments
could not be accomplished. In the absence of such adjustments, the industry could not compete effectively with foreign-produced
currants without substantial losses on the part of packers and producers. Moreover, a significant loss in foreign
markets could result. A loss of domestic markets to foreign imports could also result. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In recommending its action, the Committee recognized that it would be selling a portion of the reserve raisins at a
price well below the cost of producing raisins, and that the net proceeds to equity holders would be quite low. In the
absence of this action, open price contracting between producers and handlers on 1994&hyph;95 crop Zante Currant
deliveries was a possibility because of the excess supplies and inflated value of the inventory. On the basis of the
Committee's recommendation, handlers did not use open price contracting but instead in negotiations with the Raisin
Bargaining Association (Association) agreed to pay producers the aforementioned $980 per ton price for free tonnage
Zante Currants. Without the inventory adjustment program, very low prices for all 1994&hyph;95 crop Zante Currants
were likely. The Association is a cooperative which bargains sales terms with independent handlers on behalf of its
producer members.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is recognized that the effects of this action on individual entities will vary depending on their financial conditions
and their equities in the reserve pool. However, the impact is not expected to be significant. In the long term, the
benefits of becoming more competitive under current marketing conditions should outweigh any adverse short-term
impact and result in benefits to all industry entities. The domestic inventory price adjustment accomplished through
this action will permit an overall price reduction for handlers' sales of Zante Currants, enabling the industry to
compete more effectively with lower-priced foreign-produced currants, and to more aggressively market Zante Currants
in the interest of maintaining and expanding existing domestic and foreign markets and in developing new markets.
The net result of this action is likely to be positive as a result of increased marketings of Zante Currants at reduced
prices. On the basis of all of the foregoing, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that the issuance of this rule
will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted
by the Committee, it is determined that: (1) There has been a change of economic or marketing conditions to warrant
the sale of Zante Currant reserve raisins to handlers to provide them with raisins to sell as free tonnage, pursuant
to section 989.67(j), and (2) under the conditions presently existing in the raisin industry, the penultimate sentence
in section 989.67(j) does not now tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act and is hereby suspended with regard
to Zante Currants pursuant to section 989.91(b). However, such suspension shall continue only through July 31, 1995,
at which time it shall terminate and the suspended sentence will become operative again beginning August 1, 1995.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined that, upon good cause, it is impracticable, unnecessary,
and contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect, and that good
cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because: (1) Producers and handlers have been conducting their marketing operations on the premise that the value
of the 1992&hyph;93 and 1993&hyph;94 Zante Currants carried into the 1994&hyph;95 season would be averaged down
to the 1994&hyph;95 negotiated free tonnage price; (2) the Committee met on October 5, 1994, and computed and announced
preliminary free and reserve tonnage percentages for Zante Currant raisins; (3) prompt implementation of this action
is necessary to prevent disruption in the marketplace; and (4) the industry is aware of this action, which was unanimously
recommended by the Committee at a public meeting.

 This rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not been
reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice
Reform. This rule: (1) Will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies; (2) Will not have any retroactive
effect; and (3) Will not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit challenging the provisions
of this rule.

In compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Administrator certifies that this action would not have a
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act
(5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Based on current and historical funding levels for this program and a projected average size loan and/or grant in
the range of $300,000 to $400,000, it is estimated that 50 to 60 loans and/or grants will be made nationwide each year
under the existing rule. Applicants whose rural development projects are enhanced by this action are projected to
be less numerous, and therefore, the rule will have a limited impact upon small businesses. Since credit will be channeled
to areas which are generally underdeveloped and financially depressed, job creation and economic development resulting
from newly emerging businesses and community facilities funded by REA will not pose undue competition or other adverse
effects upon existing businesses. Therefore, this rule will have no effect upon businesses or entities other than
those to be funded through this program.

as defined by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.). Therefore, this action does not
require an environmental impact statement or assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The program is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation
with State and local officials, with the exception of applications for Project Feasibility Studies.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 15, 1989, REA published the final rule, 7 CFR 1709, subpart B, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (54 FR 6867) that implemented the Rural Economic Development Loan and Grant Program, also known as the Cushion of Credit
Payments Program, established by Section 313 of the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, as amended (Act). This program
provides funds to Act borrowers for the promotion of rural economic development and job creation projects. On September
27, 1990, REA changed the designation of this rule from 7 CFR part 1709 to part 1703 (55 FR 39393) and on September 25,
1992, published an amendment (57 FR 44314) to refine and improve the structure of the rule. On March 14, 1994, REA published
a final rule (59 FR 11702) establishing procedures to approve and administer grants and grants in conjunction with
zero-interest loans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 28, 1994, a proposed rule was published (59 FR 38378) to amend the rule to enhance the funding potential of Rural
Economic Development Loan and Grant Program (REDLGP) applications from economically devastated areas. This constitutes
the finalization of that proposed rule.

Synopsis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule amends the Rural Economic Development Loan and Grant Program as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Administrator will have the discretion to designate special economic status under the REDLGP selection
factors, adding up to 25 points to an applicant's score if at least one of the four conditions outlined in &sect;1703.46(g)(7)
has occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The prohibition on funding community antenna television systems or facilities has been reinstated except
in special cases as outlined in &sect;1703.17(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The provision for disbursement of grant funds has been revised to allow REA Borrowers with limited financial
resources, or for other reasons, to receive funds based on invoices from project owners rather than committing their
own funds under the reimbursement provision. This arrangement will require prior REA approval. See &sect;1703.22(e).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The definition of ``Rural economic development'' has been revised to clarify REA policy on funding projects
located outside rural areas as defined in Section 13 of the Rural Electrification (RE) Act but which provide significant
benefits to rural areas.

Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
REA received seven comments regarding this regulation, which were taken into consideration in preparing this final
rule. Comments were received from the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Minnesota Rural Electric Association. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Riverside County Economic Development Agency, Riverside, California. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) City of Hollister, California. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Maine Ambulatory Care Coalition, Manchester, Maine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Crown Economic Development Corporation, Hanford, California. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Merced County Board of Supervisors, Merced, California. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Community Development Division, Fresno, California. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the comments received, one commenter suggested that REA accept ``local'' unemployment data, if available, instead
of county-wide data because of significant variances in larger counties. We recognize that large geographical counties
are at a disadvantage if only countywide data is accepted. Therefore the use, where appropriate, of State-published
information, would be a reasonable alternative and have amended &sect;1703.46(g)(7)(iii) is hereby amended to
allow the REA Administrator to consider State-published statistics, provided by the applicant, in those situations
where the Census material is clearly not representative of the project location. However, the data must be verifiable
and part of a recognized database which reflects information for other areas within the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One community expressed concern that requiring disbursement of funds up front and awaiting reimbursement could
be a hardship on small rural communities. However, this requirement does not actually impact community government
entities because the reimbursement policy is applicable only in cases where REA Borrowers receive grants to establish
revolving loan funds. This final rule provides special arrangements only for REA Borrowers establishing revolving
loan funds, who are unable to fund projects using the reimbursement method. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another comment was that REA's definition of ``rural'' in this rule was too broad and would allow reviewers to fund
projects not directly benefiting rural communities. The commenter suggested that the funds either be restricted
to the 2500 population limit or controlled by organizations from such communities, that at least 70 percent of the
funds be spent in communities under 2500 and that the urban entity provide at least 60 percent in matching funds. All
REDLGP applications are reviewed by the REA staff and selected based on the evaluation criteria outlined in &sect;1703.46,
much of which is based on benefit to rural areas. Moreover, REA borrowers serve primarily rural areas, and they are
well-suited to determine that the final benefits are directed toward the local community. As discussed previously
in this preamble, the rule has been revised to allow projects which are not located in rural areas. However, those projects
must result in significant benefit to rural areas.

Another recommendation was to assign bonus points to areas ``nominated'' by State and local governments for designation
as Rural Empowerment Zones or Rural Enterprise Communities as well as those areas primarily designated by USDA as
Rural Empowerment Zones or Rural Enterprise Communities. It was suggested that these communities be rewarded for
the development of the plans and partnerships required by the nominating process and receive a portion of the points
they would have received if actually designated as Rural Empowerment Zones or Rural Enterprise Communities. REA
recognizes that community strategic planning is a key component of the Empowerment initiative, however, this additional
planning aspect will directly benefit the communities in other ways such as allowing them to realize and unlock their
own potential to partnership with the private sector and other federal and state entities. The strategic planning
process also improves the applicant's overall REDLGP application which should be reflected under the normal evaluation
criteria.

with &sect;1703.46 of this subpart. Notwithstanding this, the Administrator reserves the right to deny any proposal
for community antenna television systems or facilities. Community antenna television systems or facilities will
be considered for funding in accordance with &sect;1703.46 of this subpart and this section only when all of the following
conditions exist:

Disbursement of grant funds. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Borrowers are not authorized to commence projects to be funded under this section until those projects have been submitted
for authorization in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, or the projects have been submitted for authorization
subsequent to grant approval in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section. REA grant funds will be disbursed
on a reimbursement basis. However, upon written justification by borrowers and approval by the Administrator, borrowers
unable to fund projects under reimbursement provisions, for financial or other extraordinary reasons, may receive
grant funds under the special disbursement method by submitting unpaid invoices from project owners, and grant funds
will be disbursed to borrowers and passed directly to project owners. In either case, REA grant funds will be disbursed
in accordance with the provisions of 7 CFR Part 3015, Uniform Federal Assistance Regulations, the applicable requirements
of this subpart, the administrative provisions outlined in paragraph (g) of this section, and the following requirements:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Only projects authorized by REA in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1) and (e)(2) of this section, for which adequate
documentation is submitted, including receipts for expenditures under the reimbursement method or unpaid invoices
under the special disbursement method, as applicable, and certification of approved purposes, will be considered
for disbursement;

* * * * * 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) Under the reimbursement method, grant funds requisitioned for individual projects in increments of less than
$100,000, or less than 25 percent of the amount approved for the revolving loan fund, whichever is less, may be disbursed
semi-annually. Submission periods for requisitioning grant funds on a semi-annual disbursement basis will be 14
days commencing from the 6-month anniversary date of grant approval. Grant funds under the special disbursement
method will be requisitioned in accordance with the applicable provision in paragraph (e)(4) of this section; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) For the reimbursement method, grant funds requisitioned for individual projects in increments of $100,000 or
greater, or at least 25 percent of the amount approved for the revolving loan fund, whichever is less, may be submitted
for disbursement at any time. Under the special disbursement method, grant funds of less than $100,000 may be requisitioned
for disbursement at any time. However, the minimum requisition will be $50,000, or the total grant award, whichever
is less.

Special economic status. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrator has the discretion to designate special economic status (up to 25 points) to applications submitted
by borrowers that have documented one or more of the following four conditions in one or more county(ies) to be served
by the proposed project: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A designation of disaster area by the President of the United States which has been so designated within three years
prior to applying to REA; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The loss, removal, or closing of a major source or sources of employment in the last 3 years which causes an increase
of 2 percentage points or more in the area's most recent unemployment rate compared with the period immediately before
the dislocation; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Chronic or long-term economic deterioration, documented by one or both of the following conditions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) An unemployment level equal to or greater than 1.5 times the National average unemployment percentage from 4 out
of the last 5 years, starting with the most current statistics available. The applicant, when calculating recent
years' unemployment percentages, should compare county statistics with the National Average unemployment for
the corresponding year. Statistics on unemployment will be based on figures provided by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
However, the Administrator may, at his discretion, also consider verifiable, published State statistical data
provided by the applicant in situations where county-wide statistical data is not representative of local conditions.
Such statistical data must be part of a recognized database which reflects information for other areas within the
State; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) A 15% loss of population due to out-migration over the most recent 10-year decennial census, based on the U.S. Bureau
of the Census decennial data; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) A designation as a Rural Empowerment Zone or Rural Enterprise Community by the Empowerment Zone Program authorized
by Section 13301 of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993, Public Law 103&hyph;66 (107 Stat. 312), 26 U.S.C. 1391&hyph;1393.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to all McDonnell Douglas Model
DC&hyph;10&hyph;10, &hyph;10F, &hyph;30, and &hyph;30F series airplanes, that currently requires inspections
to detect ice or snow accumulation on top of the fuselage and in the inlet of the number 2 engine, and removal of ice and
snow accumulation. This amendment adds certain airplanes to the applicability of the rule and limits the inspection
requirement to only a certain group of airplanes. This amendment is prompted by the development of improved fan blades
on certain engines and the identification of additional airplanes that are subject to the unsafe condition. The actions
specified by this AD are intended to minimize damage to the number 2 engine due to ingestion of ice and snow.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) by superseding AD 75&hyph;04&hyph;11, amendment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
39&hyph;2094, which is applicable to all McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10, &hyph;10F, &hyph;30, and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
-30F series airplanes, was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 18, 1994 (59 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
36375). The action proposed to supersede AD 75&hyph;04&hyph;11, which currently requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspections to detect ice and snow accumulation on top of the fuselage and in the inlet of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the number 2 engine, and removal of ice and snow. The action proposed to add Model 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DC&hyph;10&hyph;15 series airplanes to the applicability of the rule, and to limit the inspection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement to only a certain group of airplanes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the single comment received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter supports the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comment noted above, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 379 McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10, &hyph;10F, &hyph;30, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&hyph;30F, and &hyph;15 series airplanes and Model KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes of the affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 226 airplanes of U.S. registry will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be affected by this AD. (Currently, there are no Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;15 series airplanes of U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registry that will be affected by this AD.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The inspections that were previously required by AD 75&hyph;04&hyph;11, and retained in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this AD take approximately 1 work hour per airplane to accomplish the required actions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact of the inspection requirement on U.S. operators is estimated to be $12,430, or $55 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per airplane, per inspection. This AD will only add the cost of inspections for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators of Model KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For operators of Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10, &hyph;10F, &hyph;30, and &hyph;30F series airplanes having all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solid fan blades in the number 2 engine position, the economic burden will be reduced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
since the previous requirement to inspect these airplanes in accordance with the existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AD will be eliminated by this AD. However, this does not relieve operators of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility to comply with the requirements of &sect;&sect;91.527 (``Operating in icing conditions'') and
121.629 (``Operation in icing conditions''_air carriers) of the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 91.527 and 121.629). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) Is not a ``significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Costruzioni Aeronautiche Giovanni
Agusta S.p.A. Model A109A and A109AII series helicopters, that currently imposes a calendar life limit of 10 years
and 6 months on the main rotor retention strap assemblies (strap assemblies). This amendment requires reducing the
calendar life limit to 8 years. This amendment is prompted by additional service experience and analyses, that show
the current life limit needs to be reduced from 10 years and 6 months to 8 years to prevent deterioration and subsequent
failure of the strap assemblies. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent failure of the strap assemblies,
loss of a main rotor blade, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
on August 21, 1992 (57 FR 37914). That action proposed to require an 8-year calendar life instead of a 10 years and 6 months
life limit on the strap assemblies, part numbers 2601521 and 109&hyph;0101&hyph;95&hyph;1, &hyph;3, and &hyph;105.

Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments
were received on the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. However, the words ``since installation''
have been removed and the word ``total'' has been added to paragraph (a)(2) to further clarify that the TIS and the calendar
years relate to the total time on the strap assemblies and not to the time since they were installed on the helicopter.
Also, the terms ``calendar year'' and ``calendar month'' have now been defined in paragraph (a)(3). Finally, the
average labor rate was raised from $55 to $60. The FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require
the adoption of the rule as proposed with the noted changes. The FAA has determined that these changes will neither
increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 46 helicopters of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately
4 work hours per helicopter to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour.
Required parts will cost approximately $1,931 per helicopter. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the
AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $99,866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

These final rules institute a new international services survey, the BE&hyph;80, Benchmark Survey of Financial
Services Transactions Between U.S. Financial Services Providers and Unaffiliated Foreign Persons, to be conducted
by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), U.S. Department of Commerce. The survey will, for the first time, collect
comprehensive information on trade in financial services between U.S. financial services providers and unaffiliated
foreign persons. It is intended to cover the universe of such transactions by type and by country. The information
is needed to support trade policy initiatives, including trade negotiations, on financial services and to compile
the U.S. balance of payments and national income and product accounts. The survey will be conducted once every 5 years
under the International Investment and Trade in Services Survey Act and the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act
of 1988. The first survey will cover 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In the July 28, 1994 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
volume 59, No. 144, 59 FR 38387, BEA published a notice of proposed rulemaking setting forth reporting requirements
for a new survey, the BE&hyph;80, Benchmark Survey of Financial Services Transactions Between U.S. Financial Services
Providers and Unaffiliated Foreign Persons. No comments on the proposed rules were received. As a result, the final
rules are the same as the proposed rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These final rules amend existing 15 CFR 801.9 and add new 15 CFR 801.11 to implement the new survey. The survey will be
conducted by BEA under the International Investment and Trade in Services Survey Act (P.L. 94&hyph;472, 90 Stat.
2059, 22 U.S.C. 3101&hyph;3108, as amended) and the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (P.L. 100&hyph;418,
15 U.S.C. 4908(b)). Section 4(a) of the International Investment and Trade in Services Survey Act provides that ``The
President shall, to the extent he deems necessary and feasible_*&blank;*&blank;*(4) conduct *&blank;*&blank;*
benchmark surveys with respect to trade in services between unaffiliated United States persons and foreign persons
*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;'' In Section 3 of Executive Order 11961, as amended by Executive Order 12518, the President
delegated the authority under the Act as concerns international trade in services to the Secretary of Commerce, who
has redelegated it to BEA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 directs that ``The Secretary (of Commerce) shall ensure that *&blank;*&blank;*
there is included in the Data Bank information on service sector activity that is as complete and timely as information
on economic activity in the merchandise sector. The Secretary shall undertake a new benchmark survey of services
transactions, including transactions with respect to *&blank;*&blank;* banking services; (and) brokerage services.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The major purposes of the survey are to provide the information on financial services needed in monitoring U.S. services
trade, analyzing its effects on the U.S. economy, formulating U.S. international trade policy, supporting bilateral
and multilateral trade negotiations, compiling the U.S. balance of payments and national income and product accounts,
developing U.S. international price indexes for services, assessing U.S. competitiveness in international trade
in services, and improving the ability of U.S. businesses to identify and evaluate market opportunities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The BE&hyph;80 survey will be conducted once every 5 years, and the first survey will be for 1994. The survey covers
the universe of financial services transactions between U.S. financial services providers and unaffiliated foreign
persons. Reporting is required from U.S. financial services providers who have sales to or purchases from unaffiliated
foreign persons in all covered financial services combined in excess of $1 million during the reporting year. Those
financial services providers meeting this criteria must supply data on the amount of their sales or purchases of each
covered type of service, disaggregated by country. U.S. financial services providers that have covered transactions
of less than $1 million during the reporting year are asked to provide, on a voluntary basis, estimates only of their
total sales or purchases of each type of financial service. The survey is scheduled to be mailed to potential respondents
in February 1995, and completed reports are due May 31.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is anticipated that the information from the benchmark survey will be updated in nonbenchmark years by an annual
follow-on survey that is more limited in scope and that will cover only a sample of the companies reporting in the BE&hyph;80
survey.

Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to vary from 4 to 150 hours, with an overall
average burden of 7.5 hours. This includes time for reviewing the instructions, searching existing data sources,
gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Comments

to: Director, Bureau of Economic Analysis (BE&hyph;1), U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20503; and to

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, Department of Commerce, has certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, Small Business Administration,
under the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), that these final rules will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The exemption level for the survey excludes most small
businesses from mandatory reporting. Reporting is required only if total sales or total purchases transactions
in financial services with unaffiliated foreign persons by U.S. persons who are financial services providers, or
by U.S. persons whose consolidated enterprise includes a separately organized subsidiary or part that is a financial
services provider, exceed $1 million during the year. In addition, international business tends to be conducted
mainly by the larger companies in a given industry; in the financial services industry, this is particularly true,
because of the high degree of consolidation occurring in that industry in the United States during the past several
years. In any event, small businesses tend to have specialized operations and activities, so those with reportable
transactions will likely not have significant amounts of data to report; therefore, the burden on them will be relatively
small.

Rules and regulations for the BE&hyph;80, Benchmark Survey of Financial Services Transactions Between U.S. Financial
Services Providers and Unaffiliated Foreign Persons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A BE&hyph;80, Benchmark Survey of Financial Services Transactions Between U.S. Financial Services Providers and
Unaffiliated Foreign Persons, will be conducted covering companies' 1994 fiscal year and every fifth year thereafter.
All legal authorities, provisions, definitions, and requirements contained in &sect;801.1 through &sect;801.9
are applicable to this survey. Additional rules and regulations for the BE&hyph;80 survey are given in paragraphs
(a) through (d) of this section. More detailed instructions are given on the report form itself.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Who must report.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Mandatory reporting.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Reports are required from each U.S. person who is a financial services provider or intermediary, or whose consolidated
U.S. enterprise includes a separately organized subsidiary or part that is a financial services provider or intermediary,
and who had transactions (either sales or purchases) directly with unaffiliated foreign persons in all financial
services combined in excess of $1,000,000 during its fiscal year covered by the survey. The $1,000,000 threshold
should be applied to financial services transactions with unaffiliated foreign persons by all parts of the consolidated
U.S. enterprise combined that are financial services providers or intermediaries. Because the $1,000,000 threshold
applies separately to sales and purchases, the mandatory reporting requirement may apply only to sales, only to purchases,
or to both sales and purchases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The determination of whether a U.S. financial services provider or intermediary is subject to this mandatory
reporting requirement may be judgmental, that is, based on the judgment of knowledgeable persons in a company who
can identify reportable transactions on a recall basis, with a reasonable degree of certainty, without conducting
a detailed manual records search.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Reporters who file pursuant to this mandatory reporting requirement must provide data on total sales and/or
purchases of each of the covered types of financial services transactions and must disaggregate the totals by country.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Voluntary reporting.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If, during the fiscal year covered, sales or purchases of financial services by a firm that is a financial services
provider or intermediary, or by a firm's subsidiaries or parts combined that are financial services providers or
intermediaries, are $1,000,000 or less, the U.S. person is requested to provide an estimate of the total for each type
of service. Provision of this information is voluntary. Because the $1,000,000 threshold applies separately to
sales and purchases, this voluntary reporting option may apply only to sales, only to purchases, or to both sales and
purchases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
BE&hyph;80 definition of financial services provider.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The definition of financial services provider used for this survey is analogous in coverage to the finance and insurance
part of Division H of the 1987 Standard Industrial Classification Manual (SIC major groups 60 through 64, and major
group 67). More specifically, companies and/or subsidiaries and other separable parts of companies in the following
industries are defined as financial services providers: Depository institutions (including commercial banks
and thrifts); nondepository credit institutions; security and commodity futures brokers, dealers, exchanges,
traders, underwriters, and services providers (including investment bankers and providers of securities custody
services); credit card companies, insurance carriers, agents, brokers and services providers; investment advisors
and managers; mutual funds; pension funds; trusts; holding companies; investors; oil royalty traders; etc.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Covered types of services.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The BE&hyph;80 survey covers the following types of financial services transactions (purchases and/or sales) between
U.S. financial services providers and unaffiliated foreign persons: Brokerage, except foreign exchange brokerage
services; private placement services; underwriting services; financial management services; credit-related
services, except credit card services; credit card services; financial advisory and custody services; securities
lending services; foreign exchange brokerage services; and other financial services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
What to file.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) The BE&hyph;80 survey consists of Forms BE&hyph;80(A) and BE&hyph;80(B). Before completing a Form BE&hyph;80(B),
a consolidated U.S. enterprise (including the top parent and all of its subsidiaries and parts combined) must complete
Form BE&hyph;80(A) to determine its reporting status. If the enterprise is subject to the mandatory reporting requirement,
or if it is exempt from the mandatory reporting requirement but chooses to report data voluntarily, either a separate
Form BE&hyph;80(B) may be filed for each separately organized financial services subsidiary or part of the consolidated
U.S. enterprise, or a single BE&hyph;80(B) may be filed, representing the sum of covered transactions by all financial
services subsidiaries or parts of the enterprise combined.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Reporters that receive the BE&hyph;80 survey from BEA, but that are not reporting data in either the mandatory
or voluntary section of any Form BE&hyph;80(B), must return the Exemption Claim, attached to Form BE&hyph;80(A),
to BEA.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is modifying 17 CFR 200.41&hyph;200.42 concerning seriatim consideration of business and actions
by individual Commissioners on a delegated basis in order to formalize current practice and clarify that any member
of the Commission may schedule a matter for joint deliberation, regardless of the number of Commissioners who have
voted to approve it, and that a member of the Commission who is serving as duty officer is authorized to approve a formal
order of private investigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has determined that these amendments and additions to its procedural rules relate solely to the agency's
organization, procedure or practice. Therefore, the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (``APA'')
regarding notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunities for public participation, and prior publication
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 are not applicable. Similarly, the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act,
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 which apply only when notice and comment are required by the APA or other laws, are not applicable.

Section 23(a)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'')
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 requires the Commission, in adopting rules under the Exchange Act, to consider the anti-competitive effects of such
rules, if any, and to balance any impact against the regulatory benefits gained in furthering the purposes of the Exchange
Act. The Commission has considered the changes adopted in this release in light of the standards cited in section 23(a)(2)
and believes that their adoption would not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance
of the Exchange Act.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In this document the Bureau of Prisons is amending its rule on furloughs. Section 570.33(c) contained provisions
governing the choice of transportation for transfers to community corrections centers. As revised, these provisions
have been simplified to indicate that an inmate may choose the means of transportation if all transportation costs
are to be borne by the inmate. The intended effect of the amendment is to reduce costs to the Bureau.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Bureau of Prisons is amending its regulations on furloughs. A final rule on this subject was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 July 1, 1981 (46 FR 34552) and was amended September 30, 1983 (48 FR 45051) and January 21, 1994 (59 FR 3510).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A proposed rule was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 January 21, 1994 (59 FR 3512) for the purpose of amending the provisions in &sect;570.33(c) which state that the Warden
may allow an inmate scheduled for transfer to a community corrections center (CCC) to choose the means of transportation
to the CCC. Under these provisions, the inmate paid all costs when the distance travelled was not over 150 miles, but
the inmate merely paid the difference in cost when the distance was over 150 miles and the inmate preferred to travel
by plane rather than by public ground transportation. As proposed for revision, paragraph (c) was simplified to indicate
that an inmate may choose the means of transportation if all transportation costs are to be borne by the inmate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment period closed on March 22, 1994. The Bureau received no comment on this rulemaking, and the Bureau is therefore
adopting the proposed amendment as a final rule without change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bureau of Prisons has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action for the purpose of E.O. 12866,
and accordingly this rule was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. After review of the law and regulations,
the Director, Bureau of Prisons has certified that this rule, for the purpose of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.
L. 96&hyph;354), does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The groundfish fishery in the GOA exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the
Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management
Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed
by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 672.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with &sect;672.20(c)(1)(ii)(B), the Pacific ocean perch TAC for the Eastern Regulatory Area was established
by the final 1994 specifications of groundfish (59 FR 7647, February 16, 1994) as 1,265 metric tons (mt).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director), established in accordance with &sect;672.20(c)(2)(ii)
a directed fishing allowance for Pacific ocean perch of 1,165 mt, with consideration that 100 mt would be taken as incidental
catch in directed fishing for other species in this area. The Regional Director has determined that this directed
fishing allowance has been reached. Consequently, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for Pacific ocean perch
in the Eastern Regulatory Area effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., October 24, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December
31, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be found in the regulations at &sect;672.20(g).

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the regulations to require manufacturers of licensed biological
products (hereinafter referred to as licensed manufacturers) to report to FDA within 15 working days all adverse
experiences associated with the use of a biological product that are both serious and unexpected; any significant
increase in the frequency of a serious, but expected adverse experience; periodically, all other adverse experiences;
and product distribution and disposition data. FDA is taking this action to provide a mechanism under which licensed
manufacturers would inform the agency, on a timely basis, of any unanticipated safety problems with marketed biological
products.

I. Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of April 24, 1979 (44 FR 24233), FDA made available for public comment a draft proposed regulation that would require
the maintenance of records and submission of reports of adverse experiences involving licensed biological products.
After evaluating the comments received and analyzing other information, FDA issued a proposed regulation (hereinafter
referred to as the 1990 proposal) and notice of availability of a draft guideline in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of March 29, 1990 (55 FR 11611 and 11655, respectively). The 1990 proposal was to require all manufacturers of licensed
biological products to submit the following reports to FDA: (1) Alert reports within 15 working days of receipt of
adverse experiences associated with the use of a licensed biological product that are both ``serious and unexpected,''
and of any ``significant increase in frequency'' of an adverse experience that is both ``serious and unexpected;''
and (2) periodic reports of all adverse experiences, including both serious and nonserious adverse experiences,
that are not included in a 15-day Alert report. The statutory authority for promulgating these regulations was described
in detail in the preamble to the 1990 proposal (55 FR 11611 at 11613). The agency provided 60 days for interested persons
to submit written comments on the 1990 proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to promulgation of this final rule, only adverse experiences associated with certain childhood vaccines (see
53 FR 10565, April 1, 1988) and fatalities resulting from blood collection or transfusion (&sect;606.170 (21 CFR
606.170)) were required to be reported to FDA for biological products. Although many manufacturers of other types
of biological products voluntarily submit adverse experience reports to FDA, there has not necessarily been consistent
or complete reporting from all licensed manufacturers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of June 3, 1993 (58 FR 31596), FDA issued a notice announcing the availability of a new form for reporting adverse events
and product problems with human drug products, biologic products, medical devices, special nutritional products,
and other products regulated by FDA. One version of the form (FDA Form 3500) was made available for use by health professionals
for voluntary reporting; the other version of the form (FDA Form 3500A) was made available for use by user facilities,
distributors, and manufacturers for reporting that is required by statute or by FDA regulation. The new form is part
of an FDA MEDWATCH program which is intended to consolidate and simplify reporting of adverse events and product problems
for all FDA-regulated products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many of the comments received in response to the 1990 proposal, while having merit, if implemented would require changes
to the regulations governing the reporting of adverse experiences for biologic products which would cause these
requirements to diverge significantly from the requirements and reporting program for drugs as provided in &sect;&sect;310.305
and 314.80 (21 CFR 310.305 and 314.80)). Such a divergence would be contrary to the MEDWATCH program which is intended,
in part, to enhance consistency in the reporting and collection of information on adverse experiences related to
FDA-regulated products. Rather than making such significant changes in this final rule, FDA is issuing a notice of
proposed rulemaking elsewhere in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 which would appropriately amend the requirements in &sect;&sect;310.305, 312.32 (21 CFR 312.32), and 314.80 for
reporting of adverse experiences related to human drugs and the requirements in this final rule (&sect;&sect;600.80
and 600.81) for reporting adverse experiences related to biological products. Later in this preamble, in response
to a number of public comments which request significant changes to the regulations, FDA refers to the proposed rule
which provides a more substantial discussion of the issues involved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Elsewhere in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, FDA is also announcing the availability of a guideline entitled ``The Guideline for Adverse Experience Reporting
for Licensed Biological Products'' (referred to as ``guideline'' in this final rule). The guideline discusses in
detail the reports required by this rule, and provides guidance concerning some appropriate means of meeting the
reporting requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Highlights of the Final Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule establishes procedures under &sect;&sect;600.80 and 600.81 for licensed manufacturers to inform
FDA about adverse experiences that are associated with the use of a licensed biological product and about biological
product distribution. These procedures are intended to support the agency's efforts to protect the public safety
by providing the agency with the information necessary for effective postmarket surveillance of biological products.
This final rule requires licensed manufacturers of biological products to submit various reports to the agency and
specifies the timeframes for submission of these reports. The reports are: (1) Fifteen-day Alert reports, (2) increased
frequency alert reports, (3) periodic adverse experience reports and (4) distribution reports. The timeframes
and contents of these adverse experience reports were the subject of numerous comments, which are discussed below.
In addition to the reporting requirements, the final rule specifies record-keeping requirements, provides for
exemptions of two categories of biological products, provides a disclaimer regarding causality, and provides for
license revocation if licensed manufacturers fail to establish and maintain records and submit the required reports.
In addition, this final rule provides procedures, under &sect;600.90, for applying for waivers from any of the reporting
requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements in this final rule are consistent with existing requirements in &sect;&sect;314.80 and 314.81
(21 CFR 314.81) regarding approved new drug products, except when differences are necessary to accommodate laws,
terminology, procedures, and characteristics unique for biological products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Scope
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The new procedures apply to all licensed manufacturers of biological products and any person, other than the licensed
manufacturer of a biological product, whose name appears on the label of a licensed biological product as a manufacturer,
packer, distributor, shared manufacturer, joint manufacturer, or a participant in divided manufacturing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Format
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The format of &sect;600.80 has been revised from what was proposed to be consistent with &sect;314.80. FDA believes
that the revised format will reduce the burden for manufacturers following the regulations for both drug and biological
products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Comments on the Proposed Rule and FDA Responses
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA received 15 letters of comment on the proposed rule. Most letters contained numerous comments on various areas
of the proposed rule. Four of these comments supported codification of the reporting requirements for adverse experiences
associated with biological products. Other comments either addressed particular paragraphs in the proposed regulation
or dealt with the effect of the regulation on a particular type of biological product. In addition to the amendments
discussed below, editorial changes were made throughout the rule. A summary of these comments and the agency's responses
follow:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. General Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Consistency With Section 314.80 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two comments on &sect;600.80 recognized the reporting issues unique to biological products and were supportive
of both the 1990 proposal and the draft guideline for recognizing the differences between drugs and biological products.
In contrast, four comments requested that FDA not deviate from the rules and guidelines applicable to drugs and requested
that the regulations for reporting adverse experiences for biological products mirror the regulations for drugs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA intends these rules to be consistent with other agency initiatives and requirements regarding adverse experience
reporting for drugs and medical devices wherever practical. This is demonstrated by the new adverse experience reporting
Form FDA&hyph;3500A, which, with the exception of adverse experience reports associated with vaccines, is to be
used for reporting of adverse events associated with drugs, biologics, and certain other products regulated by FDA.
The final rule contains requirements unique to biological products only when necessary to accommodate the laws applicable
only to biological products, such as vaccines, or to accommodate special characteristics of biological products.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Agency Review of Adverse Experience Reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment requested that the unit of FDA responsible for receiving adverse experience reports for drugs continue
to be responsible for the adverse experiences for biologics to assure consistency of interpretation of the regulations
and dissemination of information within FDA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency intends to maintain consistency between the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) and the
Center for Drugs Evaluation and Research (CDER) in the interpretation of the regulations, especially with respect
to terminology. A separate unit was created with the responsibilities related to postmarketing surveillance of
licensed biological products because the agency recognizes that these products can present different safety concerns
due to inherent differences in the products. In addition, the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (NCVIA)
mandated specific reporting requirements for manufacturers of certain vaccines and for health care providers administering
those vaccines. VAERS was established to receive these required reports, as well as reports on other vaccines. The
VAERS program is administered jointly by FDA and by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and replaces
previous vaccine reporting systems within both agencies. Section 600.80(c) has been amended in the final rule to
reflect the change of address for submitting reports due to the reorganization and relocation of CBER.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Clarification of Overlap Between the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System and &sect;600.80 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments were received requesting clarification of overlap between the requirements of NCVIA and the regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 NCVIA created a new Title XXI of the Public Health Service Act (the PHS Act). Section 2125 of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 300aa-25)
requires health care providers who administer certain vaccines and manufacturers of the vaccines to report specified
adverse experiences, occurring within specified time intervals after administration of the vaccines. These adverse
experience reports are submitted to VAERS, which is jointly managed by FDA and CDC and became operational on November
1, 1990. A form VAERS&hyph;1 was developed for these reports. When the requirements set forth in both &sect;600.80
and NCVIA necessitate reporting of an adverse event, licensed manufacturers of vaccines are not required to submit
duplicate reports to VAERS and FDA. Submission of the report to VAERS is sufficient. However, licensed manufacturers
of vaccines must comply with the regulations in &sect;600.80. Therefore, any requirements in these regulations
that are in addition to those specified in the NCVIA must be satisfied. For example, although NCVIA does not specify
the time periods for submission of adverse experience reports, the time periods set forth in &sect;600.80 apply to
reports being submitted to VAERS.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Requests for Waivers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Six comments requested waivers from the reporting requirements for specific types of adverse experiences or for
certain categories of biological products. These requests for waivers were with respect to parts or all of the requirements
of proposed &sect;600.80. In addition, one comment requested that the final rule specify the provisions for requesting
a waiver. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency agrees that the provisions for a waiver should be specified in the final rule and has added a new &sect;600.90
describing the procedures for requesting a waiver. Section 600.90 is similar to &sect;314.90 (21 CFR 314.90), the
provision for waivers for drugs or antibiotics. Manufacturers and other interested persons should submit requests
for waivers as provided in &sect;600.90 of the final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Economic Assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment requested clarification of FDA's estimate of the cost of complying with the reporting requirements of
the proposed rule of approximately $255,490. The company estimates that its cost in labor and overhead would be approximately
$40,000. In contrast, another comment stated that the company did not anticipate that this reporting requirement
would significantly alter the manner in which companies would share their postmarketing information with FDA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency's assessment of cost was made over 4 years ago when both the number of approved biological products was fewer
and costs somewhat less. In addition, the agency's figures did not take into account overhead and other costs associated
with basic manufacturing practices. Every responsible manufacturer and distributor, regardless of the type of
product manufactured, implements a means to receive inquiries about the quality and adverse effects of its products
as good manufacturing practices and as an accepted part of doing business. Therefore, this cost has not been included
in assessing the cost of this regulation. The costs assessed for this regulation only related to the specific costs
incurred by the requirements in the regulation which are in addition to customary business practice. The costs of
the regulation are for preparation of the specific reports and analyses required by the regulation and do not include
the normal operating and overhead costs of doing business. The revised economic assessment is discussed at the end
of this preamble.

B. Definitions Section 600.80(a)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Adverse Experience 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Four comments requested clarification of the definition of ``adverse experience'' in proposed &sect;600.80(a),
particularly the phrase ``significant failure of expected pharmacological action * * * whether or not considered
product related.'' One comment stated that the word ``significant'' has one meaning in the definition of ``adverse
experience'' and another statistical meaning in the usage of the term ``increased frequency'' in proposed &sect;600.80(c)(1)(ii)
and requested that the word be used consistently with the same meaning throughout the regulation. Another comment
requested a definition of ``significant failure'' as used in the definition of adverse experience. One comment requested
that the definition be amended to require reporting of changes in failure rates instead of any significant failure.
One comment gave the following examples of incidents that would be considered an adverse experience with any significant
failure: a patient who dies of acute myocardial infarction in spite of thrombolytic therapy; or a patient who dies
of congestive heart failure despite diuretic therapy, i.e., deaths from progression of the indicated disease. One
comment stated that it concurs with the agency's definition of ``adverse experience'' because it does not include
``loss of response'' as an adverse experience. The comment goes on to state that loss of immunity over time from a vaccine
is not logically an adverse event. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency agrees that the word ``significant'' when used in this context is a source of confusion and ambiguity. To
eliminate this source of confusion and to encourage the reporting of all adverse experiences, FDA revised &sect;314.80
to delete the word ``significant'' from the definition of ``adverse experience'' in the reporting requirements
for drugs (see 57 FR 17950, April 28, 1992) and is revising the definition of ``adverse experience'' in this final rule
by deleting the word ``significant.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is retaining the proposed language in the definition of ``adverse experience'' instead of adopting the
suggestion to require reporting only of changes in failure rate because a ``change in failure rate'' can only be determined
retrospectively. A change in failure rate is to be reported in an increased frequency report; however, a failure of
expected pharmacological action that causes a serious and unexpected adverse experience in humans should be reported
within 15 days regardless of the rate of such reports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes that the examples given may or may not indicate a ``failure of expected pharmacological action.''
For example, patients with congestive heart failure often have irreparable kidney damage which even the most potent
diuretics cannot overcome. In such a situation congestive heart failure would not be a failure of expected pharmacologic
action. However, the extent of pre-existing kidney damage and the degree to which kidney failure may be expected would
be demonstrable through kidney function tests prior to medication. Therefore, FDA is not amending the definition
of adverse experience as requested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency agrees partially with the comment regarding ``loss of response.'' If loss of immunity over time is the expected
pharmacologic action of the vaccine, then it is not an adverse experience. If loss of immunity is due to a patient's
compromised immune system, this also would not be considered an adverse experience. However, loss of immunity due
to an unexpected failure of the pharmacologic action of the vaccine, thereby leaving recipients susceptible to a
communicable disease, is an adverse experience and should be reported. The guideline points out that for purposes
of adverse events reporting, ``lack of effect'' is generally synonymous with ``failure to produce the expected pharmacologic
action.'' Certain products are indicated for immunization through a recommended course of several doses to achieve
a specified level of antibody titer to provide seroprotection. In this case, ``lack of effect'' is synonymous with
``failure to produce the expected pharmacologic action'' only when adequate seroconversion is not achieved following
the final dose.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Blood Components 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment noted that the language in the proposed &sect;600.80(l)(1) and preamble refers to blood components yet
the section of the CFR upon which the exemption is predicated (&sect;606.170) refers to blood products. The comment
specifically asked whether albumin and immunoglobulin are exempt from the rule and requested clarification of the
meaning of blood component in &sect;600.80(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is clarifying the regulations by adding in &sect;600.80(a) of the final rule a reference to 21 CFR 606.3(c), which
defines a ``Blood Component'' as ``that part of a single-donor unit of blood separated by physical or mechanical means.''
The exemption in &sect;600.80(l), for reporting adverse experiences associated with blood components, does not
include products derived from pooled blood such as albumin or immunoglobulin. Therefore, albumin and immunoglobulin
are biological products subject to this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a future issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FDA intends to propose revisions to &sect;606.170, concerning reports related to blood collection or transfusion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Disability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two comments requested that a definition for ``disability'' be included in &sect;600.80(a) as the phrase ``permanently
disabling'' is used in the definition of ``serious.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency agrees that the term ``disability'' should be defined and is proposing a definition in the notice of proposed
rulemaking found elsewhere in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Increased Frequency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Four comments on proposed &sect;600.80(a) requested clarification of the definition for ``increased frequency.''
Two comments stated that the proposed definition of ``increased frequency,'' as an increase in the rate of occurrence,
is misleading inasmuch as the rate of occurrence cannot be determined by a spontaneous reporting system. Two comments
requested that the definition of increased frequency take into account an adjustment for product exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency agrees with these comments and is revising the definition in &sect;600.80(a) as follows: ``Increased
frequency means an increase in the rate of occurrence of a particular adverse biological product experience, after
appropriate adjustment for exposure to the biological product.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Life Threatening 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment requested that a definition for ``life threatening'' be included, similar to that found in 21 CFR 312.32.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency agrees and is proposing a definition of ``life threatening'' in the notice of proposed rulemaking found
elsewhere in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Serious 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three comments noted discrepancies between the preamble, &sect;600.80(a) of the proposed rule, reporting form
FDA&hyph;1639, and the draft guideline regarding the meaning of the term ``serious.'' The discrepancies consisted
of differences in scope regarding the reportability of overdose, prolonged hospitalization, and severe disability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To clarify the discrepancies concerning ``overdose,'' the agency reevaluated the definition of ``serious'' to
determine whether all overdoses should be included in the definition and determined that not all overdoses are serious.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In resolving the discrepancies in the definition of ``serious'' regarding inpatient hospitalization, the agency
determined that prolonged inpatient hospitalization should be included as a serious adverse event. FDA is proposing
a revision of the definition of ``serious'' to exclude the term ``overdose'' and to include ``requires or prolongs
inpatient hospitalization'' in the notice of proposed rulemaking found elsewhere in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``disability'' is discussed in section III.B.3 of this preamble. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment requested that a definition for the word ``significant'' which compensates for changes in use patterns
be included in &sect;600.80(a). The comment is in reference to the use of the term ``significant'' in the increased
frequency alert reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency agrees in part with this comment. The agency considers ``significant'' in this context to mean a noticeable
or measurable increase in frequency after adjustment for documented changes in use patterns. However, the agency
is not codifying this definition in &sect;600.80(a) because ``significant'' may have a different meaning in a different
context within adverse experience reporting. The guideline provides clarifying examples utilizing a formula and
table to determine if there is a significant increase in frequency of an adverse experience.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
8. Clarification Between Product Defects and Adverse Experiences 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment requested clarification regarding the definitions in &sect;600.80(a) for adverse experiences and
the reporting of product defects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``adverse experience'' in &sect;600.80(a) specifies that the adverse experience must be ``associated
with the use of a biological product in humans * * *.'' Therefore, product defects either discovered in the manufacturing
process or not associated with an adverse experience in humans are not subject to this regulation. These defects may
be reportable under good manufacturing practice regulations covered in 21 CFR 600.14. However, product defects
which result in an adverse experience in a human are subject to reporting under &sect;600.80.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Review of Adverse Experiences Section 600.8(b) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Reported by Scientific Papers or Competitors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment on proposed &sect;600.80(b) stated that to place responsibility on the licensed manufacturer for review
of all adverse experience information pertaining to its product from any source, including published and unpublished
scientific papers, is both time consuming and possibly open to abuse by competitors. The comment went on to state that
if an unsubstantiated mailing from a competitor alleged ``adverse or unexpected experiences,'' the licensed manufacturer
becomes subject to the entire 15-day alert procedures, including the need to conduct, if not actually report to FDA,
the followup investigation. One comment asked the agency to specify the degree of vigor that licensed manufacturers
should use to pursue reports of adverse experiences in the scientific literature. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 600.80(b) is not intended to require licensed manufacturers to discover every published and unpublished
report on its product. However, once a report of an adverse experience is made known to the licensed manufacturer,
it is the licensed manufacturer's responsibility to comply with the requirements in &sect;600.80 regardless of
the source of the adverse experience report. It is acceptable for the licensed manufacturer to come to the conclusion
that the mailing or publication alleging an adverse experience is false or misleading and report this conclusion
to the agency. In some cases the agency may take appropriate regulatory action against persons preparing a false or
misleading report of an adverse experience. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Lack of Response Reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One comment on proposed &sect;600.80(b) stated that ``lack of response'' complaints from consumers do not have sufficient
validity to aid in decisionmaking and therefore should not be submitted to FDA. Another comment requested that ``lack
of response'' should not be submitted for single patient incidents but limited to studies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes that all reports of ``lack of response'' for single patient incidents should be reviewed and submitted
by the licensed manufacturer. Complaints from consumers should be verified with the patient's health-care provider,
if possible, prior to being submitted to FDA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Clarification of Reporting Requirements Section 600.80(c) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Terminology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two comments on proposed &sect;600.80(c) requested clarification of terminology between the term ``applicant''
used in &sect;314.80 and the term ``manufacturer'' used in proposed &sect;600.80. One comment preferred the term
``licensee'' for this regulation regarding biological products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency uses the term ``licensed manufacturer'' in these rules because it presents a more accurate representation
of those required to comply with these regulations. These rules are being promulgated for the purpose of gathering
postmarketing surveillance information, which will occur after product licensing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Responsibilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two comments requested clarification of responsibilities for joint manufacturers, shared manufacturers, divided
manufacturers, and contractual manufacturers so that duplicate adverse experience reports are not submitted.
One comment requested that, in order to avoid duplicate reporting or failures to report adverse experiences, the
agency should add language similar to &sect;314.80(c)(1)(iii). Another comment requested that the agency specify
the reporting requirements of a nonapplicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA recognizes that manufacturing of a biological product can be shared or divided among a number of business establishments.
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 25, 1992 (57 FR 55544), FDA published a notice that discussed cooperative manufacturing arrangements
for licensed biological products. In addition, 21 CFR 600.12(e) requires that ``each participating manufacturer
shall furnish to the manufacturer who prepares the product in final form for sale, barter or exchange, a copy of all
records relating to the manufacturing operations performed by such participating manufacturer insofar as they
concern the safety, purity and potency of the lots of the product involved, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
* * *.'' Other requirements regarding divided manufacturing are contained in 21 CFR 610.63, which requires that ``If
two or more establishments participate in the manufacture of a product, the name, address, and license number of each
must appear on the package label, and on the label of the container if capable of bearing a full label.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is clarifying the reporting requirements in &sect;600.80(c)(1)(iii) by substituting the term ``licensed
manufacturer'' for the term ``manufacturer.'' The agency intends that the manufacturer licensed to prepare the
final product for commercial distribution has the primary responsibility for reporting adverse experiences to
FDA. To prevent duplicate reports, language has been added to &sect;600.80(c)(1)(iii) in this final rule to clearly
delineate the responsibilities of the licensed manufacturer of the final product and other persons whose names may
appear on the product label.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Failure of Pharmacologic Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment on proposed &sect;600.80(c) requested that FDA not require single patient adverse experience forms
for each failure of expected pharmacological action. The comment suggested that increased frequency analyses should
not be performed on spontaneous lack of response reports because it is not possible for an appropriate baseline to
be constructed using either domestic or foreign spontaneous reports in this setting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA believes that the use of single patient adverse experience reporting forms provides the agency with information
that may be helpful in assessing whether there is a need for further investigation of the reported lack of response.
The agency also believes that increased frequency analyses and reports are useful to serve as an indicator that an
investigation is needed to explore the issue further. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Followup Reports to 15-day Alerts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two comments regarding proposed &sect;600.80(c)(1)(i) questioned the need for a report that briefly describes
the steps taken to seek additional information about an adverse event and the reasons why such information could not
be obtained. The comments stated that the proposed language placed an additional burden on licensed manufacturers
by requesting not only that they make every effort to obtain such information but also that they write a report describing
such efforts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under &sect;600.80(c) licensed manufacturers will be required to seek additional information and document the
steps taken to comply with the rule in a manner consistent with &sect;314.80(c). The agency is not, at this time, specifying
the format for this documentation. The agency must be able to verify the licensed manufacturer's efforts and advise
licensed manufacturers of additional steps that should be pursued to retrieve the necessary information when appropriate.
The proposed rule stated that this report should not be submitted to the agency unless so requested but should be maintained
in the licensed manufacturer's files. This requirement differs from &sect;314.80(c)(1)(i). The agency believes
it would reduce the burden for manufacturers who produce both biologics and drugs if &sect;600.80(c)(1)(i) is consistent
with &sect;314.80(c)(1)(i). Therefore, the sentence in proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;600.80(c)(1)(i), ``This report should be retained by the manufacturer in its files but not submitted as a followup
to FDA unless so requested'' has been deleted. Further discussion of changing the final disposition of these reports
is included in the notice of proposed rulemaking found elsewhere in this issue of the

3. Increased Frequency Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two comments on proposed &sect;600.80(c)(1)(ii) requested information regarding the utility of increased frequency
analysis. These comments suggest that the analysis is not of the increased frequency of adverse experiences but rather
the analysis is of the increased frequency of reports of adverse experiences. One comment requested that the agency
develop improved methods for determining increased frequency that would account for fluctuations in reporting.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA agrees that increased frequency of adverse experience reports does not necessarily correlate with an increase
in adverse experiences. Case reports are used to alert the agency about areas which may need further investigation.
FDA takes into account the fact that reporting rates vary over time in postmarketing surveillance when analyzing
the reporting rate for an individual biologic. FDA does not assume that an increase in incidence of adverse experiences
will automatically trigger an increase in reports of adverse experience. Nor does the agency assume that an increase
in the number of reports of adverse experiences necessarily indicates an increase in incidence of adverse experiences.
The agency believes that an increase in reporting rates, when taken into account with other relevant information,
may indicate that an epidemiologic investigation is needed to explore the situation further.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Periodic Reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three comments on proposed &sect;600.80(c)(2) noted a discrepancy on when the reporting period begins. One comment
requested that the interval for periodic reporting be extended to annually rather than quarterly. One comment requested
that the agency extend the time for submitting periodic reports from 30 to 60 days after the end of the reporting period.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA believes that the reports need to be submitted in a timely manner because the public is continuing to be exposed
to the products. Accordingly, FDA is retaining the proposed time schedule for submitting periodic reports in this
final rule. In the notice of proposed rulemaking published elsewhere in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, FDA is proposing to amend the regulations regarding when the reporting period begins and to amend the schedule for
submitting periodic reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Schedule for Submitting Reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Four comments on proposed &sect;600.80(c)(2)(i) requested that the agency limit reporting requirements (other
than 15-day alerts) to the first 3 or 10 years of marketing. These comments stated that the initial postmarketing period
would provide the most benefit and that after an initial period these reports would offer little benefit and would
be a burden to the agency and the licensed manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA believes that there is a need for licensed manufacturers to continually monitor adverse experiences. The length
of time a product is marketed does not guarantee that it will not be implicated in latent adverse experiences that were
not recognized previously. Novel adverse experiences can occur when a biological product is used concomitantly
with another drug or biological product. In addition, a product that has been on the market for many years can be implicated
in adverse experiences that were either previously undetected or unknown in the scientific community. For these
reasons, this requirement for periodic review and submission of reports of adverse experiences is necessary for
the public safety. However, the licensed manufacturer can request a waiver under &sect;600.90 in order to decrease
or eliminate the periodic reporting requirements for older products with a proven safety record.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under &sect;600.80(c)(2)(i) the agency may also require more frequent reports for products if appropriate; for
example, products with special safety or efficacy concerns. Similarly the agency may require less frequent reports
or no reports for products with a history of continual safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Effect of Significant Change in Manufacturing on Reporting Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment on proposed &sect;600.80(c)(2)(i) expressed concern that significant changes in the manufacturing
process, as provided in the Product License Application (PLA), may lead FDA to require that the frequency of the periodic
reports be maintained as quarterly reports. The example given in the comment was for influenza virus vaccine. The
comments questioned whether this product would be considered a new product annually due to its inherent strain changes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Influenza vaccine is an example of a product for which more frequent reports may be appropriate. The agency considers
the influenza vaccine to be a new product annually because variations in influenza strains make it necessary to reformulate
the influenza vaccine each year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the past, there have been many reports of adverse experiences associated with the influenza vaccine, including
reports of Guillain-Barre Syndrome and false positive test results for other viral markers. In situations such as
this, the agency may require more frequent reporting which will help it assess the magnitude and accuracy of reports
of adverse experiences. In &sect;600.80(c)(2)(i) FDA may upon written notice extend or reestablish the requirement
that a licensed manufacturer submit quarterly reports, or require that the license manufacturer submit reports
under this section at different times than those stated. Prompt reporting of these adverse experiences will make
it easier to either recall a problem lot or discredit a false rumor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Requirement for Negative Periodic Reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two comments on proposed &sect;600.80(c)(2) requested that the agency clarify the discrepancy between the proposed
rule and the draft guideline regarding periodic reports for products that had no adverse experiences reported. The
proposed rule did not require periodic reports for products that had no adverse experiences reported. The guideline
asked that a letter be sent stating that no adverse experiences were reported. These comments also stated that the
negative report is an ``undue burden.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The guideline has been changed to be consistent with the final rule in not requiring negative reporting at this time.
However, the agency believes that the negative reports are appropriate for the agency to determine that the licensed
manufacturer is focusing attention on whether there have been adverse experiences reported to FDA. Therefore, requirements
regarding submission of negative reports are included in the notice of proposed rulemaking found elsewhere in this
issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

8. Tabular Line Listing in Periodic Reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three comments on proposed &sect;600.80(c)(2)(ii)(C) regarding the tabular listing of adverse experiences required
in the periodic reports stated that the requirements to list the patient's identification number, age, sex, and adverse
experience terms in the tabular listing were viewed as unnecessary and excessive. Also noted were discrepancies
regarding the tabular listing requirements between the guideline and the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency agrees that the age and sex are not necessary in the tabular listing. However, the agency believes that the
adverse experience terms should be included in such a listing. The tabular line listing is intended to provide a synopsis
of individual case histories previously submitted, to assist FDA in identifying potential issues and individual
case histories for further review. The agency is amending &sect;600.80(c)(2) to require only the licensed manufacturer's
patient identification number and adverse experience terms in the tabular listing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
9. Submission of Labeling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two comments on proposed &sect;600.80(c)(2)(ii)(E) requested that the agency not require licensed manufacturers
to submit with periodic reports a copy of the most current labeling, including container labels, carton labels, package
inserts, and other materials distributed with the product. In addition, the comments stated that the current labeling
is reviewed by FDA before use and licensed manufacturers should not be required to repeatedly submit this information
with periodic reports. One comment stated that the only labeling useful for evaluating adverse experience reports
is the package insert, unless the product is sold over-the-counter, then submission of directions for consumers
on the container label may be justified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency agrees with the comments and is amending &sect;600.80(c)(2)(ii)(C) of the final rule to require ``a history
of actions taken since the last report because of adverse experiences (for example, labeling changes or studies initiated).''
This ensures that the review of the adverse experiences is conducted in the context of the latest information available.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
10. Submission of Distribution Data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ten comments related to various aspects of the requirements in proposed &sect;600.80(c)(2)(iv) for submission
of distribution data for licensed biological products. Two comments stated that the request for foreign distribution
data is a heavy burden. Three comments stated that the requirement to report dose distribution data is difficult and
inappropriate for certain types of products and that this information is not required in &sect;314.80 for drugs.
Two comments disagreed with a statement in the preamble that the quantity of a product distributed enables FDA to estimate
more accurately the incidence of a product's adverse effects. The comments reasoned that distribution data do not
determine how much product is actually used. One comment questioned FDA's ability to keep the distribution information
confidential. One comment stated that the proposed schedule for distribution reports places a hardship on manufacturers
as it required quarterly reports for new biological products, annual reports for biological products licensed more
than 3 years, and annual reports for drugs. Another comment requested guidance on the preferred format for distribution
data. The agency agrees that foreign distribution data should not be required for biological products. Although
the agency agrees that distribution data do not accurately estimate the incidence of a product's adverse effects,
it is information needed to help FDA determine whether further study is needed. FDA, on its own initiative, is amending
the final rule to parallel the drug regulations format by moving the requirements to submit distribution data to &sect;600.81.
The agency has revised the schedule for submitting distribution reports in &sect;600.81 of the final rule. The reports
will now be due on the semiannual and annual anniversary of the licensing of the product. Licensed manufacturers that
believe that the requirements for submission of distribution data are inappropriate for certain types of products
may request a waiver under &sect;600.90, as discussed elsewhere in this preamble. Until a waiver is granted the provisions
specified in the final rule are applicable.

F. Review of Scientific Literature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment on &sect;600.80(d) requested that submission of reports from scientific literature be limited to those
articles where the author believes the product is associated with the experience; i.e., ``reasonable causation''
by the author should be used in determining what adverse experiences from the literature need to be reported to FDA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes that reports of adverse experiences in the literature where the author clearly states that the
licensed manufacturer's product is not the cause do not need to be reported. Reports in the scientific literature
where no conclusion is reached regarding causality should be further investigated by the licensed manufacturer
and reported to FDA if the adverse experience is associated or remains possibly associated with the licensed biological
product. The licensed manufacturer should document the information that determines the cause to be other than product
related and retain this documentation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
G. Reporting Form FDA&hyph;1639 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Five comments on proposed &sect;600.80(f) concerned the use of Form FDA&hyph;1639 for reporting adverse experiences.
One comment stated that the form is inappropriate for their biological products, one comment asked that the form be
updated, one comment requested that Form FDA&hyph;1639 be retained for VAERS reporting as well as for adverse experience
reporting for drugs and biological products. Two comments questioned whether an approved alternate form for reporting
adverse experiences for drugs must be resubmitted to CBER for approval. One comment requested that the agency not
allow implementation of an alternative reporting form as it will cause a hardship in computerization of adverse experience
data across the biological and pharmaceutical product lines. This comment requested that the same form (Form FDA&hyph;1639)
be used for all adverse experience reports regardless of the nature of the product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has designed a new adverse experience reporting form (Form FDA&hyph;3500A) which, with the exception of reporting
adverse experiences associated with vaccines, is ordinarily to be used to report under &sect;&sect;310.305, 312.32,
314.80, 600.80, and parts 803 and 807 regarding drugs, biological products, and devices, respectively. The new form
will simplify and consolidate the reporting of adverse events and product problems and will enhance agency-wide
consistency in the collection of postmarketing data. Any computer-generated forms will have to be submitted to MEDWATCH,
5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20852&hyph;9787, for approval to use in complying with this final rule. As one comment
suggested, alternative formats will make computerization of adverse experience data across product lines difficult.
Therefore, a licensed manufacturer should submit adequate justification for an alternative format.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Form FDA&hyph;3500A is referenced in &sect;600.80(f) of the final rule. The term ``form designated by FDA'' is used
throughout the remainder of the final rule to accommodate any future changes in the form itself. For vaccines the designated
form for reporting adverse experiences is Form VAERS&hyph;1. The form for VAERS is discussed in a published report
in

H. Reporter Identification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment on proposed &sect;600.80(h) requested that if the reporter is the patient (or relative) that his or her
name not be listed on the adverse experience form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency concurs with this request for adverse experience reporting for licensed biological products other than
vaccine-associated experiences being reported in accordance with NCVIA. Under NCVIA it would be appropriate to
include the patient's name in the report because copies of this report may be made available to the vaccinee or legal
representative of the vaccinee. For adverse experience reporting of licensed biological products other than vaccines
being reported under NCVIA, the report should not include the name of the patient, but should assign a unique code number
to each report. For adverse experience reporting of biological products, patient identifiers are not releasable
to the public under FDA's public information regulations (21 CFR part 20). Section 600.80(h) is amended to reflect
that VAERS reports are subject to the CDC Privacy Act System.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment concerning proposed &sect;600.80(h) requested that the agency increase the number of characters in
the unique code number assigned to each report from eight characters in length to nine characters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency encourages consistency by designating in the final rule a number of characters to be used, to simplify preparing
and processing the reports. To allow some flexibility, note that &sect;600.80(h) in the final rule recommends but
does not require use of a code number of eight characters or less.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
J. Recordkeeping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two comments on proposed &sect;600.80(i) related to the length of time a licensed manufacturer is required to keep
adverse experience records. One comment requested clarification regarding whether form letters sent by the licensed
manufacturer to the adverse experience reporter must be retained 10 years; another comment requested that the recordkeeping
be limited to 1 year past the involved product's expiration date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA believes that 10 years is a reasonable time to maintain such records. This requirement corresponds with existing
regulations for drug products. If a form letter to the reporter is the documentation that the licensed manufacturer
sought additional information about an adverse experience, then the form letter must be maintained in the file for
10 years. Any letters which are part of the correspondence regarding an adverse experience reporting must be maintained
in the file for 10 years.

K. Exemptions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has determined that &sect;600.80(l) should be amended to clarify that licensed manufacturers of in vitro diagnostic
products, including assay systems for the detection of antibodies or antigens to retroviruses, report adverse experiences
under the device reporting regulations. The best way to monitor product defects with these licensed biological devices
is for them to be reported under the Medical Devices: Medical Device User Facility, Distributor, and Manufacturer
Reporting, Certification, and Registration Regulations (see 56 FR 60024, November 26, 1991). To eliminate any confusion
over how to report product defects with these products, the final rule is amended to state specifically that in vitro
diagnostics, including assays to detect antibodies or antigens to retroviruses (such as HIV&hyph;1 and HIV&hyph;2),
are exempt from this rule but are subject to the device reporting regulations.

IV. Analysis of Impacts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has examined the impacts of the proposed rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.
L. 96&hyph;354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory
alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including
potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and
equity). The agency believes that this final rule is consistent with the regulatory philosophy and principles identified
in the Executive Order. In addition, the final rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined by the Executive
Order and so is not subject to review under the Executive Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze regulatory options that would minimize any significant
impact of a rule on small entities. The final rule codifies adverse experience reporting for biological products
currently being practiced by licensed manufacturers on a voluntary basis. FDA believes that the information collection
resulting from postmarket surveillance required by this final rule will be of benefit to the public health. FDA has
prepared a Threshold Assessment to estimate the cost to comply with the final rule by the regulated industry. The estimation
by FDA for the total annual cost to industry is $3,937,164. The agency certifies that the final rule will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, no further
analysis is required.

V. Environmental Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(a)(8) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.

Description
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: FDA is charged with the responsibility for determining that a biological product meets the statutory standards
for safety, purity, and potency for initial and continued licensure. To carry out this mandate, the agency needs to
be informed whenever a manufacturer of a licensed biological product receives or otherwise becomes aware of information
about adverse experiences associated with the use of its product. Only if FDA is provided with such information will
it be able to evaluate the risk, if any, associated with a biological product and take whatever action is necessary
to reduce or eliminate the public's exposure. FDA is taking this action to provide a mechanism under which manufacturers
would inform the agency, on a timely basis, of any unanticipated safety problems with marketed biological products.
This action is similar to initiatives taken by FDA regarding new drugs and medical devices.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Definitions
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The following definitions of terms apply to this section:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Adverse experience
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means any adverse event associated with the use of a biological product in humans, whether or not considered product
related, including the following: an adverse event occurring in the course of the use of a biological product in professional
practice; an adverse event occurring from overdose of the product, whether accidental or intentional; an adverse
event occurring from abuse of the product; an adverse event occurring from withdrawal of the product; and any failure
of expected pharmacological action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Blood Component
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for this purpose has the same meaning as defined in &sect;606.3(c) of this chapter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Increased frequency
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means an increase in the rate of occurrence of a particular adverse biological product experience, e.g., an increased
number of reports of a particular adverse biological product experience after appropriate adjustment for biological
product exposure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Serious
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means an adverse experience associated with the use of a biological product that is fatal or life-threatening, is
permanently disabling, requires inpatient hospitalization, or is a congenital anomaly, cancer, or overdose.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Unexpected
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means an adverse biological product experience that is not listed in the current labeling for the product and includes
an event that may be symptomatically and pathophysiologically related to an event listed in the labeling, but differs
from the event because of greater severity or specificity. For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis
would be unexpected (by virtue of greater severity) if the labeling only referred to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.
Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater specificity)
if the labeling only listed cerebral vascular accidents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Review of adverse experiences
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Any person having a product license under &sect;601.20 of this chapter shall promptly review all adverse experience
information pertaining to its product obtained or otherwise received by the licensed manufacturer from any source,
foreign or domestic, including information derived from commercial marketing experience, postmarketing clinical
investigations, postmarketing epidemiological/surveillance studies, reports in the scientific literature,
and unpublished scientific papers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Reporting requirements
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The licensed manufacturer shall report to FDA adverse experience information, as described in this section. The
licensed manufacturer shall submit two copies of each report described in this section for nonvaccine biological
products, to the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (HFM&hyph;210), Food and Drug Administration, 1401
Rockville Pike, suite 200 N., Rockville, MD 20852&hyph;1448. Submit all vaccine adverse experience reports to:
Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), P.O. Box 1100, Rockville, MD 20849&hyph;1100. FDA may waive the
requirement for the second copy in appropriate instances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Fifteen-day Alert reports
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (i) The licensed manufacturer shall report each adverse experience that is both serious and unexpected, regardless
of source, as soon as possible but in any case within 15 working days of initial receipt of the information. These reports
are required to be submitted, for nonvaccine biological products, on a form designated by FDA or a suitable format
containing all of the data elements in the FDA designated reporting form, and, for vaccines on a VAERS form. The licensed
manufacturer shall promptly investigate all adverse experiences that are the subject of these 15-day Alert reports
and shall submit followup reports within 15 working days of receipt of new information or as requested by FDA. If additional
information is not obtainable, a followup report may be required that describes briefly the steps taken to seek additional
information and the reasons why it could not be obtained. These 15-day Alert reports and followups to them are required
to be submitted under separate cover and may not be included, except for summary or tabular purposes, in a periodic
report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The licensed manufacturer shall review periodically (at least as often as the periodic reporting cycle) the
frequency of reports of adverse biological product experiences that are both serious and expected and reports of
therapeutic failure (lack of effect), regardless of source, and report any significant increase in frequency as
soon as possible but in any case within 15 working days of determining that a significant increase in frequency exists.
Upon written notice, FDA may require that licensed manufacturers review the frequency of reports of serious, expected
adverse biological product experiences at intervals different than the periodic reporting cycle. Reports of a significant
increase in frequency are required to be submitted in narrative form (including the time period on which the increased
frequency is based, the method of analysis, and the interpretation of the results), rather than using the form designated
by FDA. Fifteen-day Alert reports based on increased frequency are required to be submitted under separate cover
and may not be included, except for summary purposes, in a periodic report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The requirements of paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of this section, concerning the submission of Fifteen-day
Alert reports, shall also apply to any person other than the licensed manufacturer of the final product whose name
appears on the label of a licensed biological product as a manufacturer, packer, distributor, shared manufacturer,
joint manufacturer, or any other participant involved in divided manufacturing. In order to avoid unnecessary duplication
in the initial and followup submission of reports to FDA, the obligations of a manufacturer other than the licensed
manufacturer, may be met by submitting all reports to the licensed manufacturer of the final product. If a manufacturer
other than the licensed manufacturer elects to submit reports to the licensed manufacturer rather than to FDA, it
shall submit each report to the licensed manufacturer within 3 working days of its receipt, and the licensed manufacturer
shall then comply with the requirements of this section. Under this circumstance, the manufacturer shall maintain
a record of this action which shall include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) A copy of all adverse biological product experience reports submitted to the licensed manufacturer,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Date the report was received by the manufacturer, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Date the report was submitted to the licensed manufacturer,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Name and address of the licensed manufacturer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Each report submitted under this paragraph shall bear prominent identification as to its contents, i.e., ``15-day
Alert report'' or ``15-day Alert report--followup.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Periodic adverse experience reports
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (i) The licensed manufacturer shall report each adverse experience not reported under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this
section at quarterly intervals, for 3 years from the date of issuance of the product license, and then at annual intervals.
The licensed manufacturer shall submit each quarterly report within 30 days of the close of the quarter (the first
quarter beginning on the date of issuance of the product license) and each annual report within 60 days of the anniversary
date of the issuance of the product license. Upon written notice, FDA may extend or reestablish the requirement that
a licensed manufacturer submit quarterly reports, or require that the licensed manufacturer submit reports under
this section at different times than those stated.  Followup information to adverse experiences submitted in a periodic
report may be submitted in the next periodic report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Each periodic report shall contain: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) A narrative summary and analysis of the information in the report and an analysis of the 15-day Alert reports submitted
during the reporting interval (all 15-day Alert reports being appropriately referenced by the licensed manufacturer's
patient identification number, adverse reaction term(s), and date of submission to FDA);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) A form designated for Adverse Experience Reporting by FDA for each adverse experience not reported under paragraph
(c)(1)(i) of this section (with an index consisting of a line listing of the licensed manufacturer's patient identification
number and adverse reaction term(s)); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) A history of actions taken since the last report because of adverse experiences (for example, labeling changes
or studies initiated).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Periodic reporting, except for information regarding 15-day Alert reports, does not apply to adverse experience
information obtained from postmarketing studies (whether or not conducted under an investigational new drug application),
from reports in the scientific literature, and from foreign marketing experience. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Scientific literature
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) A 15-day Alert report based on information from the scientific literature shall be accompanied by a copy of the
published article. The 15-day Alert reporting requirements in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section (i.e., serious,
unexpected adverse experiences) apply only to reports found in scientific and medical journals either as case reports
or as the result of a formal clinical trial. The 15-day Alert reporting requirements in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this
section (i.e., a significant increase in frequency of a serious, expected adverse experience or of a therapeutic
failure) apply only to reports found in scientific and medical journals either as the result of a formal clinical trial,
or from epidemiologic studies or analyses of experience in a monitored series of patients.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) As with all reports submitted under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, reports based on the scientific literature
shall be submitted on the reporting form designated by FDA or comparable format as prescribed by paragraph (f) of this
section. In cases where the licensed manufacturer believes that preparing the form designated by FDA constitutes
an undue hardship, the licensed manufacturer may arrange with the Division of Biostatistics and Epidemiology (HFM&hyph;210)
for an acceptable alternative reporting format.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Postmarketing studies
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) Licensed manufacturers are not required to submit a 15-day Alert report under paragraph (c) of this section for
an adverse experience obtained from a postmarketing clinical study (whether or not conducted under a biological
investigational new drug application) unless the licensed manufacturer concludes that there is a reasonable possibility
that the product caused the adverse experience.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The licensed manufacturer shall separate and clearly mark reports of adverse experiences that occur during a
postmarketing study as being distinct from those experiences that are being reported spontaneously to the licensed
manufacturer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Reporting forms
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(1)(ii), and (f)(3) of this section, the licensed manufacturer shall complete
the reporting form designated by FDA (FDA&hyph;3500A, or, for vaccines, a VAERS form) for each report of an adverse
experience.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Each completed form should refer only to an individual patient or single attached publication. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Instead of using a designated reporting form, a licensed manufacturer may use a computer-generated form or other
alternative format (e.g., a computer-generated tape or tabular listing) provided that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The content of the alternative format is equivalent in all elements of information to those specified in the form
designated by FDA; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) the format is approved in advance by MEDWATCH: The FDA Medical Products Reporting Program; or, for alternatives
to the VAERS Form, by the Division of Biostatistics and Epidemiology. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Copies of the reporting form designated by FDA (FDA&hyph;3500A) for nonvaccine biological products may be obtained
from the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (address above). Additional supplies of the form may be obtained
from the Consolidated Forms and Publications Distribution Center, 3222 Hubbard Rd., Landover, MD 20785. Supplies
of the VAERS form may be obtained from VAERS by calling 1&hyph;800&hyph;822&hyph;7967. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Multiple reports
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A licensed manufacturer should not include in reports under this section any adverse experiences that occurred
in clinical trials if they were previously submitted in the product license application. If a report refers to more
than one biological product marketed by a licensed manufacturer, the licensed manufacturer should submit the report
to the license for the product listed first in the report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Patient privacy
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. For nonvaccine biological products, a licensed manufacturer should not include in reports under this section the
names and addresses of individual patients; instead, the licensed manufacturer should assign a unique code number
to each report, preferably not more than eight characters in length. The licensed manufacturer should include the
name of the reporter from whom the information was received. The names of patients, health care professionals, hospitals,
and geographical identifiers in adverse experience reports are not releasable to the public under FDA's public information
regulations in part 20 this of chapter. For vaccine adverse experience reports, these data will become part of the
CDC Privacy Act System 09&hyph;20&hyph;0136, ``Epidemiologic Studies and Surveillance of Disease Problems.''
Information identifying the person who received the vaccine or that person's legal representative will not be made
available to the public, but may be available to the vaccinee or legal representative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Recordkeeping
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The licensed manufacturer shall maintain for a period of 10 years records of all adverse experiences known to the
licensed manufacturer, including raw data and any correspondence relating to the adverse experiences. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Guideline
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. FDA has prepared a guideline for the submission of reports of adverse experiences and suggested followup investigation
of reports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(k) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Revocation of license
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If a licensed manufacturer fails to establish and maintain records and make reports required under this section
with respect to a licensed biological product, FDA may revoke the product license for such a product in accordance
with the procedures of &sect;601.5 of this chapter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(l) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Exemptions
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

(m) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Disclaimer
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A report or information submitted by a licensed manufacturer under this section (and any release by FDA of that report
or information) does not necessarily reflect a conclusion by the licensed manufacturer or FDA that the report or information
constitutes an admission that the biological product caused or contributed to an adverse effect. A licensed manufacturer
need not admit, and may deny, that the report or information submitted under this section constitutes an admission
that the biological product caused or contributed to an adverse effect. For purposes of this provision, this paragraph
also includes any person reporting under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section.

&sect;600.81 Distribution reports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The licensed manufacturer shall submit information about the quantity of the product distributed under the product
license, including the quantity distributed to distributors. The interval between distribution reports shall
be 6 months. Upon written notice, FDA may require that the licensed manufacturer submit distribution reports under
this section at times other than every 6 months. The distribution report shall consist of the bulk lot number (from
which the final container was filled), the fill lot numbers for the total number of dosage units of each strength or
potency distributed (e.g., fifty thousand per 10-milliliter vials), the label lot number (if different from fill
lot number), labeled date of expiration, number of doses in fill lot/label lot, date of release of fill lot/label lot
for distribution at that time. If any significant amount of a fill lot/label lot is returned, include this information.
Disclosure of financial or pricing data is not required. As needed, FDA may require submission of more detailed product
distribution information. Upon written notice, FDA may require that the licensed manufacturer submit reports under
this section at times other than those stated. Requests by a licensed manufacturer to submit reports at times other
than those stated should be made as a request for a waiver under &sect;600.90.
