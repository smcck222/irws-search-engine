<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;9&hyph;80
series airplanes and Model MD&hyph;88 airplanes, that requires modification of the power transfer unit (PTU). This
amendment is prompted by reports of fatigue cracks found in the drain port housings of the PTU's on several airplanes.
The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent failure of the PTU housing due to fatigue cracking, which could
result in the loss of both hydraulic systems (until the PTU is shut off).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;9&hyph;80 series airplanes and Model MD&hyph;88
airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 27, 1994 (59 FR 38146). That action proposed to require modification of the power transfer unit (PTU).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter supports the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters requested that the proposed compliance time of ``14,300 flight cycles on the PTU or 9 months after the
effective date of the AD, whichever occurs later,'' be extended. These commenters are concerned that they will be
unable to modify their affected fleets within the proposed compliance time due to a possible problem in the availability
of an ample number of required parts from the manufacturer. The FAA does not concur with the commenter's request to
extend the compliance time. In developing an appropriate compliance time for this action, the FAA considered not
only the degree of urgency associated with addressing the subject unsafe condition, but the availability of required
parts and the practical aspect of installing the required modification within a maximum interval of time allowable
for all affected airplanes to continue to operate without compromising safety. The FAA has been advised that an ample
number of required parts will be available for modification of the U.S. fleet within the proposed compliance period.
However, under the provisions of paragraph (b) of the final rule, the FAA will consider requests for adjustments to
the compliance time if data are submitted to substantiate that such an adjustment would provide an acceptable level
of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The applicability of the final rule has been revised to delete the reference to Model ``DC&hyph;9&hyph;84 (MD&hyph;84).''
This inclusion of this reference was in error; no such model of airplane exists. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the change previously described. The FAA has determined
that this change will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 1,074 Model DC&hyph;9&hyph;80 series airplanes and Model MD&hyph;88 airplanes of the affected
design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 578 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that
it will take approximately 2 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor
rate is $60 per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $2,912 per airplane. Based on these figures, the
total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,752,496, or $3,032 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) Is not a ``significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The FAA estimates that 128 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it will take approximately 6 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $42,240, or $330 per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to PTC Aerospace Model 91700 passenger oxygen
system, installed in PTC Aerospace Model 881, 940, and 950 seats installed on McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;10 series
aircraft. This AD requires a one-time inspection to verify the proper configuration and functioning of the passenger
oxygen system, and replacement, if necessary, with serviceable parts. This amendment is prompted by oxygen canisters
failing to activate due to the installation of incorrect pin release brackets or defective oxygen canister release
pins. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent failure of the passenger oxygen system to activate.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to PTC Aerospace Model 91700 passenger oxygen system, installed in PTC Aerospace Model 881,
940, and 950 seats found on McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;10 series aircraft, was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on September 21, 1993 (58 FR 48486). That action proposed to require a one-time inspection to verify the proper configuration
and functioning of the passenger oxygen system, and replacement, if necessary, with serviceable parts. The actions
would be required to be accomplished in accordance with PTC Service Bulletin (SB) No. 25&hyph;1233, Revision D, dated
February 2, 1993, that describes procedures for a one-time inspection to verify the proper configuration and functioning
of the passenger oxygen system, and replacement, if necessary, with serviceable parts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter supports the rule as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters state that the compliance time should be reduced, one to six months after the effective date of the AD,
the other to 30 days. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) does not concur. Neither comment offered engineering
or technical data to support a reduction in the compliance interval from the 15-month compliance time contained in
the proposed rule. The proposed compliance time was determined to provide an acceptable level of safety considering
the maintenance schedules of the operators. Therefore, the FAA has retained the 15-month compliance time in the final
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter states that the lanyard length check should be deleted due to difficulty in performing that check. The
FAA concurs that the check was difficult to perform but does not concur in deleting the check. The check is needed to
verify the correct lanyard length. Since publication of the NPRM, the manufacturer has advised the FAA that the lanyard
length tolerance has been increased to plus or minus .25 inch, which will allow that check to be more easily accomplished.
This tolerance factor has been added to paragraph (a)(3) of this Final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter states that the AD should require repetitive inspections. The FAA does not concur. The one-time inspection,
and replacement, if necessary, with serviceable parts, required by this AD will obviate the need for repetitive inspections
other than those performed during routine scheduled maintenance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter further states that the AD should contain a requirement for reporting malfunctions. The FAA does not
concur. The one-time inspection, and replacement, if necessary, with serviceable parts, required by this AD will
preclude the need for reporting malfunctions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter further states that the SB does not provide adequate work step instructions. The FAA concurs. Since
issuance of the NPRM, PTC Aerospace has issued SB No. 25&hyph;1233, Revision E, dated April 15, 1994, which contains
clarified work step instructions. The FAA has added this new service bulletin to the AD.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The commenter further states that the SB should specify a different oxygen canister safety cap. The revised SB specifies
two safety caps. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter further states that a functional test should be required prior to disassembly. The FAA does not concur.
The FAA has determined that a functional test prior to disassembly would not provide any benefit in evaluating the
passenger oxygen system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter further states that there should be a snag test on the release pin for grooves and burrs. The FAA does not
concur. The FAA believes that the instructions for testing as stated in the revised SB are adequate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since publication of the NPRM, the manufacturer has advised the FAA that an additional safety cap, Scott Part Number
(P/N) 36425&hyph;00, is available. Also, the manufacturer has added a black plastic grommet, P/N 91880&hyph;2,
on the pin release bracket, and a bushing, P/N 121836&hyph;1, on the activator assembly spring, P/N H13341. Finally,
the manufacturer has included instructions for verifying the gap between the cable actuating lever and the cable
activating lever stop in PTC Aerospace SB No. 25&hyph;1233, Revision E, dated April 15, 1994. These revised instructions
have been added to the compliance section of this final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes described previously. The FAA has determined
that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The initial estimate in the NPRM of approximately 3,000 passenger oxygen systems of the affected design in the worldwide
fleet was incorrect. The manufacturer has advised the FAA that the revised number is 4,800 passenger oxygen systems
in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 4,000 passenger oxygen systems are installed on aircraft of U.S. registry,
of which 2,500 have already been modified, leaving approximately 1,500 passenger oxygen systems that have not yet
been modified in accordance with this AD. The FAA estimates that it will take approximately 1 work hour per passenger
oxygen system to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts
will cost approximately $20 per passenger oxygen system. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on
U.S. operators is estimated to be $112,500. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

Applicability: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
PTC Aerospace Model 91700 passenger oxygen system, installed in PTC Aerospace Model 881, 940, and 950 seats, installed
on McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;10 series aircraft. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Compliance: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To prevent failure of the passenger oxygen system to activate, accomplish the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Within 15 months after the effective date of this AD, or the next seat removal, whichever occurs first, verify the
proper configuration and functioning of the passenger oxygen system in accordance with PTC Aerospace Service Bulletin
No. 25&hyph;1233, Revision E, dated April 15, 1994, as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Remove the seat bottom cushion and open the oxygen housing assembly door, Part Number (P/N) 91626, to expose the
oxygen canister and lower firing system. On the Model 950 seats, remove fastening screws of the center console, P/N
98154, and rotate the console forward in addition to removing the cushion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Install an oxygen canister safety cap, Tri-Star P/N CD3, or Scott P/N 36425, to prevent discharging of the oxygen
canister. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Remove the cable release assembly, P/N 91601. Verify that the assembly is the correct length (10.25 inches plus
or minus .25 inch), that the release pin, P/N 91587&hyph;1, is free of burrs and notches, and that the nylon cord is not
worn and is free of any burn damage. If any discrepancies are found, replace with a serviceable unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Verify installation of the correct pin release bracket, P/N 91602&hyph;1. A correct bracket has its plastic grommet
located vertically above the oxygen canister release sleeve. If the bracket is found to be misaligned, replace it
with a correct bracket. Replace the white plastic grommet with a new black plastic grommet, P/N 122326, securing it
with Devo 44044 cyanoacrylate adhesive or equivalent. The grommet is correctly positioned when the grommet slot
is aligned with the pin release bracket slot. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Reassemble the cable release assembly with the safety cap on the oxygen canister. Adjust and tighten the jam nuts,
P/N H12292, to obtain a gap between the cable actuating lever, P/N 91599&hyph;1 or ^2, and cable actuating lever stop,
P/N 87310&hyph;3, within .03 inch and .25 inch. Verify that the nylon cord will not contact the oxygen canister in the
assembled configuration and that the cable release pin will release from the oxygen canister with a tension of one
pound or less. If any discrepancies are found, replace the cable release assembly with a serviceable unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Remove the oxygen masks from the seat back housing. Compress the actuator assembly spring, P/N H13341, and install
a bushing, P/N 121836&hyph;1, oriented so that the spring seats in the bushing's counterbore. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Reassemble the oxygen system components with the safety cap on the oxygen canister. Verify that the oxygen system
functions properly by verifying that the lanyard assembly release pin, P/N 91587&hyph;1, releases from the oxygen
canister when the masks are pulled from the seat back housing. If any discrepancies are found, replace the oxygen system
with a serviceable unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of
safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Boston Aircraft Certification Office. The request should be forwarded
through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager,
Boston Aircraft Certification Office.

On August 23, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) by amending
the Sheridan, Wyoming, Class E airspace designation (59 FR 43311). Interested parties were invited to participate
in the rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal. No comments were received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During an airspace review an error was discovered in the airspace description for Class E airspace at Sheridan, Wyoming.
This action corrects that error. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class
E airspace is published in Paragraph 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994,
which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be
published subsequently in the Order.

This amendment to part 71 of Federal Aviation Regulations amends Class E airspace at Sheridan, Wyoming. The FAA has
determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and
routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. 
<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->
It, therefore, (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant
rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation
of a regulatory evaluation as the anicipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect
air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entites under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) is issuing an order on rehearing of its order which removed
from the Commission's regulations certain natural gas regulations related to natural gas producer regulations
that were either obsolete or nonessential in light of the decontrol of wellhead prices. The order on rehearing denies
the requests for rehearing concerning the deletion of the anti-circumvention rule in &sect;270.203(c) of the Commission's
regulations. The Commission finds that, with the decontrol of wellhead pricing, no purpose is any longer served by
this rule.

The issue raised on rehearing is whether the Commission should have eliminated &sect;270.203(c) of the Commission's
regulations. That section included in the definition of first sale all sales by an affiliate of an interstate pipeline,
intrastate pipeline, or local distribution company. Rehearing applicants contend that, as a result, the Commission
has improperly deprived affiliated marketer sales of their status as deregulated first sales under the Wellhead
Decontrol Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 2(21) of the NGPA defines a first sale. Sections 2(21) (A) (i)&hyph;(iv) and (B) set forth a general definition
of a first sale that excludes sales of affiliates of inter- and intrastate pipelines and local distribution companies
(LDCs) from the first sale definition unless the affiliate is selling gas it produced. However, section 2(21)(A)(v)
grants the Commission authority to define, as a first sale, any sale that does not qualify under sections 2(21)(A)
(i)&hyph;(iv) ``in order to prevent circumvention of any maximum lawful price established under this Act.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1979, in Order No. 58 implementing the NGPA, the Commission exercised its NGPA section 2(21)(A)(v) authority to
define all sales by pipeline affiliates as first sales. That definition was set forth in 18 CFR 270.203(c). Specifically,
&sect;270.203(c) provides that any sale by an affiliate of an interstate pipeline, intrastate pipeline, or LDC is
a first sale under the NGPA unless the Commission determines not to treat it as such. The Commission explained that
the reason for such treatment of affiliate sales was to prevent circumvention of the NGPA maximum lawful prices because
otherwise an entity could avoid first sale treatment by becoming an affiliate of a pipeline.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Thus, although sales by interstate pipeline marketing affiliates generally would not qualify as first sales under
NGPA sections (21) (A) (i)&hyph;(iv) and (B), they came to be defined as first sales by reason of &sect;270.203(c).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act of 1989 repealed as of January 1, 1993, the entire Title I of the NGPA which contains
the ceiling prices. However, the Decontrol Act did not remove nor modify NGPA section 2(21), including the authorization
for the Commission to define as first sales those sales that would not otherwise qualify for such status.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Order No. 567 removed from the Commission's regulations certain natural gas regulations related to natural gas producer
regulation that the Commission considered obsolete or nonessential in light of the decontrol of wellhead prices.
These included the &sect;270.203(c) definition of a first sale.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On rehearing of Order No. 567, the petitioners urge the Commission to retroactively reinstate &sect;270.203(c).
They argue that the removal of &sect;270.203(c) adversely affects marketing affiliates of interstate pipelines
by placing them at a competitive disadvantage in relation to non-regulated non-affiliated marketers. They assert
that the removal of the regulation means that affiliated marketer sales will no longer qualify as deregulated first
sales under the Wellhead Decontrol Act and that they will become subject to Natural Gas Act (NGA) price and non-price
regulation. They contend that the blanket marketer certificates that would apply under the NGA are not equivalent
to deregulation and are always subject to change or termination by the Commission. They assert that treatment as non-regulated
first sales is essential to continue fair competition among affiliated and non-affiliated marketers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the parties contend that the Commission has failed to satisfy the requirements of the Administrative Procedure
Act (APA) by removing &sect;270.203(c) without public notice or opportunity to comment.

III. Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the reasons discussed below, the Commission denies rehearing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. First Sale Status
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Order No. 567 deleted &sect;270.203(c) from the Commission's regulations as part of the removal of a number of regulations
that were rendered obsolete or nonessential by the Wellhead Decontrol Act. The Commission continues to believe that
the deletion of &sect;270.203(c) was appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Wellhead Decontrol Act has eliminated all maximum lawful prices applicable to first sales. As a result, no purpose
is any longer served by our exercising our authority under NGPA section 2(21)(A)(v) to define additional categories
of sales as first sales ``in order to prevent circumvention of any maximum lawful price established under this Act.''
Circumvention cannot be a concern when there are no maximum lawful prices to circumvent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission recognizes that, as a result of the Wellhead Decontrol Act and our subsequent deletion of &sect;270.203(c),
interstate pipeline marketing affiliates' sales are no longer first sales. However, this fact does not create a competitive
disadvantage for marketing affiliates as alleged. In Order No. 547, the Commission issued blanket certificates
under section 7 of the NGA to all persons making sales of gas for resale in interstate commerce who are not interstate
pipelines. Certain additional conditions were attached to the blanket certificates issued to interstate pipeline
marketing affiliates to preclude potential discriminatory practices. Those blanket certificates place all marketers
on an equal competitive footing by effectively eliminating the distinctions in treatment that formerly existed
between regulated and non-regulated marketers. An interstate pipeline affiliated marketer may make sales under
its blanket certificate at negotiated rates with pregranted abandonment to compete with unregulated marketers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, at this time, there is no practical difference between treatment as marketing affiliates under the blanket
marketer sales certificates issued in Order No. 547 and treatment as first sales. Petitioners' concern appears to
be more that regulation under the blanket certificates might change in the future, rather than any concern with how
this system of light-handed regulation operates at the present time. For example, Texaco Gas Marketing Inc. states
in its request for rehearing, ``The blanket sales certificate regulations prevent the removal of Section 2[70].203(c)
from having any present effect, but if the blanket certificate is modified or repealed, non-affiliated marketers
and affiliated marketers may not be competing on a level playing field.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 But, our July 28, 1994 order did nothing to affect the terms of the blanket marketer certificates issued by Order No.
547 and, therefore, the rights of the parties have not been affected, and thus no party has been aggrieved by our order.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Moreover, the Commission continues to believe that the existing blanket marketer certificates are appropriate,
considering the competitive wellhead market and the changes in the industry due to restructuring under Order No.
636 and decontrol under the Wellhead Decontrol Act. Thus, no changes to those certificates are contemplated.

to be considered aggrieved a party must demonstrate a ``present and immediate'' injury in fact, or ``at least *&blank;*&blank;*
a looming unavoidable threat'' of injury. The alleged injury must be ``concrete, perceptible harm of a real, non-speculative
nature.'') If the Commission were to alter the blanket certificates in the future, the Commission would reexamine
the treatment of affiliate sales at that time.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The parties requesting rehearing rely on a statement in the March 12, 1993 order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on rehearing of Order No. 547, which was issued after wellhead decontrol took effect, as supporting their position
that affiliated marketer sales should continue to be treated as first sales even after wellhead decontrol. In that
order, the Commission interpreted section 201 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 as providing that all importations
of natural gas and LNG, that are subject to a free trade agreement, are beyond the Commission's jurisdiction, since
they are deregulated first sales under the Wellhead Decontrol Act. In clarifying that inter-affiliate importations
are first sales eligible for the exemption from Commission jurisdiction granted by section 201 of the Energy Policy
Act, the Commission relied in part on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;270.203(c). The Commission stated that, while its interpretation in &sect;270.203(c) ``stemmed, in part,
from a concern about affiliates' ability to circumvent the then existing maximum lawful prices under Title I of the
NGPA *&blank;*&blank;* the Commission has continued to adhere to its interpretation of the statute even as the categories
of maximum lawful prices waned pursuant to the NGPA.'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
7
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 However, the Commission finding in that order was for the narrow purpose of interpreting section 201 of the Energy
Policy Act regarding the importation of natural gas and LNG that is subject to a free trade agreement. Moreover, Congress
itself, in that section, intended to define all such importations as NGPA first sales. Thus it appears the Commission's
reliance on the &sect;270.203(c) definition was unnecessary to the results reached in that order.

without notice and comment. Under section 553(b)(B) of the APA, an agency is not required to issue a notice of proposed

In the July 28, 1994 final rule, the Commission merely updated its regulations to remove regulations rendered obsolete
by the Wellhead Decontrol Act. Ordinarily the Commission may update its regulations in that manner without notice
and comment, and it has done so in the past.

 And in this case, the appropriateness of the removal of the regulations other than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;270.203(c) without notice is undisputed. However, in retrospect, the Commission recognizes that it might
have been better to provide public notice and an opportunity to comment before the removal of &sect;270.203(c). However,
in the particular circumstances of this case, the Commission does not believe that any party has been significantly
harmed.

First, the issue here is a relatively narrow one of whether the anti-circumvention rule adopted in &sect;270.203(c)
should be eliminated, in light of the fact that the Wellhead Decontrol Act has removed the maximum lawful prices whose
circumvention &sect;270.203(c) was designed to prevent. While the parties had no opportunity to comment on that
issue before Order No. 567 was issued, the parties have now had such an opportunity in their requests for rehearing.
Eight parties have taken advantage of the opportunity to comment on rehearing, and discussed the issue in detail.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 Of course an opportunity to comment on rehearing does not cure the lack of prior notice in all cases. Here, however,
given the relatively narrow issue involved, it does not appear that providing any further opportunity to comment,
at this stage, would serve any useful purpose.

This is particularly so, since, at present, there is no practical difference in treatment between operating under
the blanket marketer sales certificates and treatment as a non-regulated first seller. Therefore, the rulemaking
has had no substantive impact on the rights of the parties. Moreover, the blanket certificate having been issued by
rule, any change in that certificate would entail a new rulemaking proceeding in which parties would have a full opportunity
for notice and comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 the Federal Energy Administration found that an emergency existed and the court found that the threat to the public
would be sufficiently dire for good cause to be found to not provide notice and comment. But the APA does not require
an emergency, and provides an exception where there is no substantive effect, as in

 The only issue was whether the notice and opportunity to comment that was provided was sufficient to give the public
fair notice of the final form of the rule. Here, in the particular circumstances of this case, the rehearing requests
have provided a sufficient opportunity. In

 Today's action announces a partial 3-month stay and reconsideration of certain national emission standards for
hazardous air pollutants for certain sources. The effectiveness of provisions of the ``National Emission Standards
for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Source Categories: Organic Hazardous Air Pollutants from the Synthetic Organic
Chemical Manufacturing Industry and Other Processes Subject to the Negotiated Regulation for Equipment Leaks''
59 FR 19402 (April 22, 1994) and 59 FR 29196 (June 6, 1994) (collectively known as the ``hazardous organic NESHAP''
or the ``HON''), for compressors and for surge control vessels and bottoms receivers is stayed for 3 months pending
reconsideration. The EPA is issuing this stay pursuant to Clean Air Act section 307(d)(7)(B), 42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(7)(B),
which provides the Administrator authority to stay the effectiveness of a rule during reconsideration.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 22, 1994 (59 FR 19402), and June 6, 1994 (59 FR 29196), the EPA promulgated in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (``NESHAP'') for the synthetic organic chemical manufacturing
industry (``SOCMI''), and for several other processes subject to the equipment leaks portion of the rule. These regulations
were promulgated as subparts F, G, H, and I in 40 CFR part 63, and are commonly referred to as the HON. Subpart H establishes
standards for equipment leaks, including standards for compressors (40 CFR 63.164) and for surge control vessels
and bottoms receivers (40 CFR 63.170). The final rule required existing sources to comply with subpart H beginning
October 24, 1994, for some groups of SOCMI processes and for processes subject to subpart I (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
40 CFR 63.100(k)(3)(i) and 63.190(e)(2)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A petition for reconsideration has been submitted to the EPA requesting the HON be revised in order for sources to have
additional time to comply with the equipment leak provisions applicable to compressors and to surge control vessels
and bottoms receivers. The petition contains new information demonstrating that compliance by October 24, 1994,
with the standards applicable to compressors and to surge control vessels and bottoms receivers, is not possible
because at many facilities major equipment modifications or replacements are necessary in order to comply with the
standards. This new information, which the EPA did not have prior to the promulgation of the HON, is described more
fully in the notice contained in the Proposed Rules section of today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that proposes to defer compliance with the equipment leak provisions of the HON that are applicable to compressors
and to surge control vessels and bottoms receivers. For these reasons, the EPA is staying the effectiveness of the
provisions of the HON applicable to leaks from compressors and from surge control vessels and bottoms receivers for
3 months in order to respond to the petition for reconsideration and revise the rule as necessary to resolve this issue.

40 CFR 63.100(k)(3)(ii) through (k)(3)(v). In the proposal contained in today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, however, EPA is proposing a compliance extension for the sources required to comply as of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 23, 1995, or later, as well as the sources required to comply as of October 24, 1994. Accordingly, today's stay
does not affect all sources with compressors or surge control vessels and bottoms receivers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Issuance of Stay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA hereby issues a 3-month administrative stay of the effectiveness of the HON equipment leak provisions applicable
to compressors and to surge control vessels and bottoms receivers for sources required to comply beginning on October
24, 1994. The EPA will reconsider the compliance dates in the rule and, following the notice and comment procedures
of section 307(d) of the Clean Air Act, will take appropriate action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Authority for Stay and Reconsideration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The administrative stay and reconsideration announced by this notice are being undertaken pursuant to section 307(d)(7)(B)
of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(7)(B). That provision authorizes the Administrator to stay the effectiveness
of a rule for up to 3 months in order to consider a request for reconsideration. Reconsideration is appropriate if the
grounds for an objection arose after the period for public comment and if the objection is of central relevance to the
outcome of the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The grounds for reconsideration of this rule arose after the public comment period. The problems attendant to requiring
compliance with the equipment leak provisions applicable to compressors and to surge control vessels and bottoms
receivers only became apparent after the close of comment on the rule. Therefore, the EPA is staying the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectiveness of the rule for 3 months in order to allow time to reconsider this issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Proposed Compliance Extension 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA may not be able to complete the reconsideration (including any appropriate regulatory action) of the rule
stayed by this notice within the 3-month period expressly provided in section 307(d)(7)(B). If the EPA does not complete
the reconsideration in this timeframe, then it will be necessary to temporarily extend the applicable compliance
dates. In the Proposed Rule Section of today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the EPA proposes a temporary extension of the compliance dates beyond 3 months if necessary in order to complete reconsideration
and revision of the rules in question. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this action will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small business entities.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule identifies communities, where the sale of flood insurance has been authorized under the National Flood
Insurance Program (NFIP), that are suspended on the effective dates listed within this rule because of noncompliance
with the floodplain management requirements of the program. If the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) receives
documentation that the community has adopted the required floodplain management measures prior to the effective
suspension date given in this rule, the suspension will be withdrawn by publication in the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NFIP enables property owners to purchase flood insurance which is generally not otherwise available. In return,
communities agree to adopt and administer local floodplain management aimed at protecting lives and new construction
from future flooding. Section 1315 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4022, prohibits
flood insurance coverage as authorized under the National Flood Insurance Program, 42 U.S.C. 4001 et seq., unless
an appropriate public body adopts adequate floodplain management measures with effective enforcement measures.
The communities listed in this document no longer meet that statutory requirement for compliance with program regulations,
44 CFR part 59 et seq. Accordingly, the communities will be suspended on the effective date in the third column. As of
that date, flood insurance will no longer be available in the community. However, some of these communities may adopt
and submit the required documentation of legally enforceable floodplain management measures after this rule is
published but prior to the actual suspension date. These communities will not be suspended and will continue their
eligibility for the sale of insurance. A notice withdrawing the suspension of the communities will be published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has identified the special flood hazard areas in these communities
by publishing a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). The date of the FIRM if one has been published, is indicated in the fourth
column of the table. No direct Federal financial assistance (except assistance pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford
Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act not in connection with a flood) may legally be provided for construction
or acquisition of buildings in the identified special flood hazard area of communities not participating in the NFIP
and identified for more than a year, on the Federal Emergency Management Agency's initial flood insurance map of the
community as having flood-prone areas (section 202(a) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4106(a),
as amended). This prohibition against certain types of Federal assistance becomes effective for the communities
listed on the date shown in the last column. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Deputy Associate Director finds that notice and public comment under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and unnecessary
because communities listed in this final rule have been adequately notified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each community receives a 6-month, 90-day, and 30-day notification addressed to the Chief Executive Officer that
the community will be suspended unless the required floodplain management measures are met prior to the effective
suspension date. Since these notifications have been made, this final rule may take effect within less than 30 days.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Deputy Associate Director has determined that this rule is exempt from the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility
Act because the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4022, prohibits flood insurance coverage
unless an appropriate public body adopts adequate floodplain management measures with effective enforcement measures.
The communities listed no longer comply with the statutory requirements, and after the effective date, flood insurance
will no longer be available in the communities unless they take remedial action.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) establishes new regulations to require regulatory
authorities to use OSM's Applicant/Violator Computer System (AVS) and other information sources to identify ownership
or control links between permit applicants and violators.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations establish the procedures, standards, and type of proof required to challenge ownership or control
links and to disprove violations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM also amends a number of regulations affecting blocking of permits, abatement of notices of violation, improvidently
issued permits, and permit application information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations reduce the possibility of violators receiving and retaining permits in violation of the permit approval
provisions of SMCRA. Finally, the rules establish enhanced due process procedures for the regulated community.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 510(c) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA or the Act) and 30 CFR part 773 establish
certain requirements for permits and permit processing. These requirements include the identification of ownership
or control links between permit applicants and individuals or entities who are responsible for unabated violations
of certain Federal or State laws and rules. See 30 CFR 773.5; 30 CFR 773.15(b). The purpose of such inquiry is to determine
whether a permit applicant is linked to unabated violations of the Act and related air and water quality requirements.
See 30 CFR 773.15(b). In the event that a permit applicant is so linked, the regulatory authority may not issue a permit
to the applicant unless the applicant submits proof that the violation has been or is in the process of being corrected
to the satisfaction of the agency that has jurisdiction over the violation. In the alternative, the applicant may
establish that the violation is the subject of a good faith, direct, administrative or judicial appeal which contests
the validity of the violation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Id. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the event that a permit applicant is so linked and proof of the violation's correction or good faith appeal is not
submitted, issuance of a permit to the applicant may constitute improvident issuance and may subject the permittee
to certain remedial measures including suspension or rescission of the permit. See 30 CFR 773.20 and 30 CFR 773.21.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No. 81&hyph;2134 (D.D.C. January 31, 1985) (Parker, J.), the Secretary of the Interior was required to improve the
enforcement and implementation of Section 510(c) of SMCRA, and to establish a computerized Applicant/Violator
System (``AVS'') to match permit applicants and their owners and controllers with current violators of SMCRA. OSM
has developed such a computer system to enable OSM and State regulatory authorities to comply effectively with the
responsibilities prescribed by Section 510(c) of SMCRA and 30 CFR part 773.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On January 24, 1990, OSM and DOI entered into a Settlement Agreement attempting to resolve litigation with Save Our
Cumberland Mountains (``SOCM'') and other plaintiffs. The Settlement Agreement was approved by the U.S. District
Court on September 5, 1990, and became effective, by its own terms, on that date. See Memorandum of the Court,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 No. 81&hyph;2134 (D.D.C. September 5, 1990). That Settlement Agreement contained provisions whereby OSM agreed
to propose rules to implement Section 510(c) of SMCRA and the AVS. Accordingly, on September 6, 1991, OSM proposed
rules whose purpose was:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
to require that, prior to issuing permits to applicants, regulatory authorities consider complete ownership and
control information in conducting the analysis mandated by section 510(c) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 773.15(b). The proposed
rules would mandate the use of AVS as a critical component of the ownership and control information consideration
process.

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
See Proposed Rule, Use of the Applicant/Violator Computer System in Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Permit Approval,
56 FR 45780, 45781 (September 6, 1991). While the proposal of the rules fulfilled certain provisions of OSM's Settlement
Agreement with SOCM, OSM indicated that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
it must be emphasized that OSM independently believes that the proposal and public consideration of such rules are
important to assist OSM in implementing its duties under Section 510(c) of SMCRA and duties imposed by regulations
such as 30 CFR 773.15. The proposed rules should be viewed as proposals that OSM would have made regardless of any litigation
or settlement.

Subsequently, on March 16, 1992, the U.S. Court of Appeals (D.C. Cir.) vacated the District Court's approval of the
Settlement Agreement with SOCM.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
No. 90&hyph;5374, Slip. Op. (U.S. Court of Appeals, D.C. Cir., May 22, 1992). In its decision, the Court noted that
``nothing'' in the Court's opinion precluded OSM's maintenance and improvement of the AVS as agency policy.

As OSM indicated at the time of its proposal of September 1991, these rules are important and appropriate_independent
of any litigation or settlement. OSM continues to be committed to the maintenance and improvement of the AVS as a matter
of agency policy and believes that the publication of final rules is now necessary to the effective implementation
of section 510(c) of the Act and the implementation of the AVS. OSM's commitment to AVS is in accord with the position
recently expressed by the Senate Appropriations Committee:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Regarding the AVS, the Committee joins the House in commending OSM for improvements made to the system. The Committee
has consistently supported development and implementation of the AVS because the AVS is essential to effective enforcement
of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 [SMCRA].

Report of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senate Report No. 103&hyph;114, at page 47 (July 28, 1993). Accordingly,
OSM has determined to go forward with the final rules published today without regard to the course of litigation between
OSM and SOCM or any other person. OSM has reviewed the proposed rules in light of the comments that have been made with
a view towards serving the agency's commitment to protecting the environment, to implementing SMCRA, and ultimately,
to serving the public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These final rules incorporate the AVS into the Federal regulations and mandate the use of the system by State and Federal
surface mining regulatory authorities. At the same time that these rules strengthen the enforcement of Section 510(c),
they also establish a detailed set of procedural pathways to assure the protection of due process for the regulated
community.

As indicated above, OSM published proposed rules on September 6, 1991. The proposed regulations were available for
public comment until November 20, 1991. Comments were received from members of the regulated community, representatives
of environmental advocacy groups, representatives of State regulatory authorities, and various citizens. While
a total of 20 commenters submitted written comments, most comments can be grouped into three major categories which
are captioned below. After the discussion of these three major issues, this preamble will then provide a section-by-section
discussion of the final rules.

The Table of Contents is amended to include new section numbers 773.22, verification of ownership or control application
information; 773.23, review of ownership or control and violation information; 773.24, procedures for challenging
ownership or control links shown in AVS; and 773.25, standards for challenging ownership or control links and the
status of violations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 773.5 is amended to include definitions of ``Applicant/Violator System'' or ``AVS.'' The terms are defined
to mean the computer system maintained by OSM to identify ownership or control links involving permit applicants,
permittees, and persons cited in violation notices. The regulation is further amended to include definitions of
``Federal violation notice,'' ``Ownership or control link,'' ``State violation notice,'' and ``Violation notice.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A ``Federal violation notice'' is defined to include a violation notice issued by OSM or by another agency or instrumentality
of the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An ``ownership or control link'' is defined as any relationship included in the definition of ``owned or controlled''
or ``owns or controls'' in 30 CFR 773.5 or in the violations review provisions of 30 CFR 773.15(b). It includes any relationship
presumed to constitute ownership or control under 30 CFR 773.5(b) unless such presumption has been successfully
rebutted under sections 773.24 and 773.25 of this rule or under the provisions of 30 CFR part 775 and &sect;773.25 of
this rule. It also includes an identity between persons, e.g., an applicant and a violator.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A ``State violation notice'' is defined as a violation notice issued by a State regulatory authority or by another
agency or instrumentality of State government.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
``Violation notice'' is defined as any written notification from any governmental entity advising of violations
of the Act or any other laws which would form the basis for a regulatory authority to deny issuance of a permit in accordance
with the criteria contained in &sect;773.15(b) of the regulations. The type of written notification is broadly defined
to include a letter, memorandum, legal or administrative pleading, or other written communication. Consistent
with the provisions of &sect;773.15(b), the term includes notification of a violation of the Act, any Federal rule
or regulation promulgated pursuant thereto, a State program, or any Federal or State law, rule, or regulation pertaining
to air or water environmental protection in connection with a surface coal mining operation. It includes, but is not
limited to, a notice of violation; an imminent harm cessation order; a failure-to-abate cessation order; a final
order, bill, or demand letter pertaining to a delinquent civil penalty; a bill or demand letter pertaining to delinquent
abandoned mine reclamation fees; and a notice of bond forfeiture, where one or more violations upon which the forfeiture
was based have not been corrected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 773.10 is revised to include the new sections of the AVS-related rules that result in information collection
requirements. The revision provides an estimate of the average public reporting burden of four and one-half hours
per response for the collection of information under part 773 as such part is revised by these final rules. The section
also lists the addresses for OSM and OMB where comments on the information collection requirements may be sent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph 773.15(b)(1) is amended to require the regulatory authority to review all reasonably available information
concerning violation notices and ownership or control links involving the applicant. Such information would include
that obtained pursuant to &sect;773.22 (verification of ownership or control application information); &sect;773.23
(review of ownership or control and violation information); &sect;778.13 (identification of interests); and &sect;778.14
(violation information).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The net effect of referencing such provisions in &sect;773.15(b)(1) is to assure that the regulatory authority makes
a decision with respect to permit issuance or denial based upon complete information relating to ownership, control,
and violations. Such complete information includes the mandated use of AVS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, in accordance with &sect;773.23, the regulatory authority will follow the procedures and standards
set forth in &sect;&sect;773.24 and 773.25 in deciding whether to issue the permit under &sect;773.15(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM has also decided to amend 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) to provide that, in the absence of a failure-to-abate cessation order
(FTACO), a regulatory authority may presume that a notice of violation (NOV) is being corrected to the satisfaction
of the agency with jurisdiction over the violation where the abatement period for such notice of violation has not
yet expired and where the permit applicant has provided certification in his or her permit application that such violation
is in the process of being abated to the satisfaction of the agency with jurisdiction over the violation. In addition,
OSM has also amended 30 CFR 773.15(b)(2) to provide that any permits issued incident to such presumption and certification
will be conditionally issued based upon successful completion of the necessary abatement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 773.20 is amended by the insertion of a new paragraph (b)(2), which makes the provisions of proposed &sect;773.25,
standards for challenging ownership or control links and the status of violations, applicable when a regulatory
authority makes determinations with respect to improvidently issued permits. In this context, &sect;773.25 is
applicable when a regulatory authority determines whether a violation, penalty, or fee existed at the time that it
was cited, remains unabated or delinquent, has been corrected, is in the process of being corrected, or is the subject
of a good faith appeal, and whether any ownership or control link between the permittee and the person responsible
for the violation, penalty, or fee existed, still exists, or has been severed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The insertion of the language referring to &sect;773.25 has the effect of assuring that the standards, responsibilities,
and procedures created by proposed &sect;773.25 are consistently applied to permit issuance and to determinations
regarding improvident permit issuance. Such an approach enhances the fairness of the permitting process and the
prospect for the uniform enforcement of nationwide minimum standards. In one respect, however, the improvident
permit issuance process will differ from the permit issuance process. In the improvident permit issuance process,
prior to permit suspension or rescission, the permittee will be able to challenge the existence of the violation at
the time it was cited. In the permit issuance process, prior to permit denial, the applicant will not be able to challenge
the existence of the violation at the time it was cited.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM has also renumbered certain provisions of the regulation at 30 CFR 773.20(c). Among such provisions, renumbered
paragraph (c)(1)(iv), which authorizes the regulatory authority to use rescission as one of the remedial measures
for improvident permit issuance, deletes a specific reference contained in the former 30 CFR 773.20(c)(4) to the
rescission procedures of 30 CFR 773.21.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reason for this deletion is that OSM today establishes a prior notice and a common appeal procedure for both permit
suspensions and permit rescissions with respect to improvidently issued permits. The former regulation governing
permit suspensions at 30 CFR 773.20(c)(3) did not impose any specific requirements for prior notice, opportunity
to be heard, or right of appeal for the permittee whose permit is to be suspended. See 54 FR 18450 (1989). In contrast
to this, regulations governing permit rescissions at 30 CFR 773.21 contained specific requirements for prior notice
to a permittee and an explicit right of appeal. OSM has now provided for greater consistency in its procedures governing
suspension and rescission of permits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, OSM amends 30 CFR 773.20 to add a new paragraph (c)(2) which requires that a regulatory authority which
decides to suspend a permit must provide at least 30 days' prior written notice to the permittee. In the event that the
regulatory authority decides to rescind a permit, it must provide notice in accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR
773.21. The amendment further provides that a permittee be given the opportunity to request administrative review
of the notice under Office of Hearings and Appeals, (OHA) rule 43 CFR 4.1370 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, where OSM is the regulatory authority, or under the State program equivalent, where the State is the regulatory authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulation further allows for enhanced due process protection and fairness by providing that temporary relief
from the regulatory authority's decision is available in accordance with the provisions of OHA rule 43 CFR 4.1376
or the State program equivalent. In the absence of such temporary relief, the regulatory authority's decision remains
in effect during the pendency of appeal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM has retained the language in paragraph 773.20 which addresses the situation which occurs when a permit is issued
in reliance upon the presumption that an NOV is being abated in the absence of a cessation order and a cessation order
is, in fact, issued with respect to the violation. In such an event, a regulatory authority is required to find that
the permit has been improvidently issued.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM amends paragraph (a) of 30 CFR 773.21 to make the provisions of &sect;773.25, standards for challenging ownership
or control links and the status of violations, applicable when a regulatory authority invokes the automatic suspension
and rescission procedures of 30 CFR 773.21. The rationale for such amendment is the same as that discussed above with
respect to similar language contained in &sect;773.20.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, OSM deletes former paragraph (c) of 30 CFR 773.21 which provides for appeals of rescission notices. As discussed
above, rescission appeal procedures are incorporated in 30 CFR 773.20.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 773.22 is a new section and mandates an inquiry whose focus is to assure that the regulatory authority develops
complete and accurate information as to the identification of the applicant and all owners or controllers of the applicant
prior to making a determination on a permit application and enters such information promptly into the AVS. Accordingly,
this section focuses on verification of ownership or control application information. Such accurate and complete
information enables the regulatory authority to make an informed decision as to whether the applicant is linked to
a surface coal mining and reclamation operation in violation of the Act or other any other environmental law within
the terms of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (a) of &sect;773.22 imposes a duty upon a regulatory authority to review the information provided in the
permit application, pursuant to 30 CFR 778.13(c) and 778.13(d), to determine whether the information provided,
including the identification of the operator and all owners and controllers of the operator, is complete and accurate.
In making such determination, the regulatory authority is required to compare information provided in the application
with information contained in manual and automated data sources. Manual sources for review include the regulatory
authority's own enforcement and inspection records and State corporation commission or tax records, to the extent
they contain information concerning ownership or control links. Automated data sources include the regulatory
authority's own computer systems, if any, and the AVS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) of &sect;773.22 provides that, if it appears from information provided in the application pursuant
to paragraphs (c) and (d) of &sect;778.13 that none of the persons identified in the application has had any previous
mining experience, the regulatory authority has to inquire of the applicant and investigate whether anyone other
than those persons identified in the application will own or control the mining operation as either an operator or
as another type of owner or controller.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) of &sect;773.22 provides that if, after conducting the information review described above, the regulatory
authority identifies any potential omission, inaccuracy, or inconsistency in the ownership or control information
provided in the application, it must contact the applicant prior to making a final determination with respect to the
application. The applicant is then required to resolve the potential omission, inaccuracy, or inconsistency through
submission of an amendment to the application or a satisfactory explanation which includes credible information
sufficient to demonstrate that no actual omission, inaccuracy, or inconsistency exists. The regulation also contains
a reference to required action by the regulatory authority in accordance with &sect;843.23, sanctions for knowing
omissions or inaccuracies in ownership or control and violation information, or the State program equivalent, where
appropriate. As will be described more fully below, OSM is deferring action at this time with respect to proposed &sect;843.23.
Such proposed section will be considered as part of a subsequent rulemaking. OSM has, however, retained the reference
to proposed &sect;843.23 in final &sect;773.22 in the event that proposed &sect;843.23 is ultimately adopted. Nevertheless,
OSM has made no decision with respect to the adoption of proposed &sect;843.23 and the retention of such reference
does not mean that OSM will ultimately adopt proposed &sect;843.23 as a final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d) of &sect;773.22 requires that, upon completion of the information review mandated by &sect;773.22,
the regulatory authority promptly enter into or update all ownership or control information on AVS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 773.23 is a new section which delineates the regulatory authority's review obligations with respect to a
permit application after the regulatory authority has completed the process of verifying ownership or control application
information as described in proposed &sect;773.22.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a) of &sect;773.23 requires the regulatory authority to review all reasonably available information
concerning violation notices and ownership or control links involving the applicant to determine whether the application
can be approved under the provisions of 30 CFR 773.15(b). With respect to ownership or control links involving the
applicant, such information includes all information obtained under proposed &sect;773.22 and 30 CFR 778.13. With
respect to violation notices, such information includes all information obtained under &sect;778.14, information
obtained from OSM, including information shown in the AVS, and information obtained from the regulatory authority's
own records concerning violation notices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In substance, the regulation assures that the regulatory authority considers complete ownership, control, and
violation information in making the decision required by 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) with respect to a permit application.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (b) of &sect;773.23 provides the course of action which a regulatory authority is required to take if the
review conducted pursuant to paragraph (a) of the section discloses any ownership or control link between the applicant
and any person cited in a violation notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, paragraph (b)(1) of &sect;773.23 requires that the regulatory authority notify the applicant of such link
and refer the applicant to the agency with jurisdiction over the violation notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b)(2) of &sect;773.23 requires that the regulatory authority not approve the permit application unless
and until it determines that all ownership or control links between the applicant and any person cited in a violation
notice are erroneous or have been rebutted, or the regulatory authority determines that the violation to which the
applicant has been linked has been corrected, is in the process of being corrected, or is the subject of a good faith
appeal, within the meaning of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) or the State program equivalent. The determinations to be made by
the regulatory authority under paragraph (b)(2) of the regulation are made in accordance with the provisions of &sect;773.24,
procedures for challenging ownership or control links shown in AVS, and &sect;773.25, standards for challenging
ownership or control links and the status of violations, or their State program equivalents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) of &sect;773.23 requires that, following the regulatory authority's decision on the application
or following the applicant's withdrawal of the application, the regulatory authority is required to promptly enter
all relevant information related to the decision or withdrawal into AVS. The regulatory authority's decision could
include unconditional issuance, conditional issuance, or denial of the permit. The requirement that all relevant
information be promptly entered into AVS is intended to insure that AVS is continually updated to reflect the most
current information available with respect to permit applicants. A critical source of such information is the regulatory
authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 773.24 is a new section that establishes the procedures to be followed if a person wishes to challenge an ownership
or control link between a person and any other person shown on AVS. The procedures to be followed by both OSM and the challenger
are included. The section provides procedures for direct appeals of such links to OSM by persons who have been so linked.
The section also provides for challenges concerning the status of violations to which persons shown on AVS have been
linked. The section further provides the opportunity for those persons making a challenge to obtain a temporary relief
from any adverse use of the challenged link or violation information during the pendency of such challenge.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a)(1) of &sect;773.24 provides that an applicant or anyone else shown in AVS is an ownership or control
link to any person could challenge such a link in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (b) through (d) of &sect;773.24
and in accordance with the provisions of &sect;773.25. Paragraph (a)(1) of &sect;773.24 provides, however, that
such challenge is not available if the challenger is bound by a prior administrative or judicial decision with respect
to the link.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a)(1) of &sect;773.24 provides that challenges of ownership or control links shown on AVS are made before
OSM.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a)(2) of &sect;773.24 provides that an applicant or anyone else shown in AVS in an ownership or control
link to a person cited in a Federal violation notice seeking to challenge the status of such violation may do so in accordance
with the provisions of paragraphs (b) through (d) of &sect;773.24 and in accordance with the provisions of &sect;773.25,
which are discussed in detail below. The procedures applicable are similar to those described in paragraph (a)(1)
of &sect;773.24.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``status of the violation'' means whether the violation remains outstanding, has been corrected, is in the process
of being corrected, or is the subject of a good faith, direct administrative or judicial appeal to contest the validity
of the violation. See 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1)(i)&hyph;(ii). This usage is carried forward into paragraphs (b) and (c)
of &sect;773.24 and into the provisions of paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of &sect;773.25. The process for challenging the
status of a Federal violation is a Federal process and such challenges will be made before OSM.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In challenging the current status of a violation under &sect;773.24 or 773.25, a person will not be able to challenge
the existence of the violation at the time it was cited unless the challenge is made by a permittee within the context
of the improvidently issued permit process or by an applicant after permit denial. In general, the existence of the
violation will have been established by prior administrative or judicial proceedings involving the person cited
in the violation notice, or by such person's failure to exhaust its available remedies in a timely manner.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (a)(2) of &sect;773.24 provides, in language similar to that contained in paragraph (a)(1) of the regulation,
that the opportunity to challenge the status of a violation is not available to any person who ``is bound by a prior administrative
or judicial determination concerning the status of the violation.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a)(3) of &sect;773.24 provides that any applicant or person shown in AVS to be linked by ownership or control
to a person cited in a State violation notice may challenge the status of the violation before the State that issued
the violation notice. The challenge must be made in accordance with the State's program equivalents to paragraphs
(b) through (d) of &sect;773.24 and &sect;773.25. Again, the challenge may not involve the existence of the violation
at the time it was cited, and is not available if the challenger is bound by a prior administrative or judicial determination
with respect to status of the violation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) of &sect;773.24 requires that any applicant or other person seeking to challenge ownership or control
links shown in AVS or the status of Federal violations must submit to OSM a written explanation of the basis for his or
her challenge and provide relevant evidentiary materials and supporting documents. The information must be submitted
to the Chief of OSM's AVS Office in Washington, DC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) of &sect;773.24 provides that, in response to a challenge made under paragraph (b) of that section,
OSM must make a written decision with respect to the ownership or control link and/or with respect to the status of the
violation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(1) of &sect;773.24 provides that, if OSM has determined that the ownership or control link has been
shown to be erroneous or has been rebutted and/or that the violation covered by the violation notice has been corrected,
is in the process of being corrected, or is the subject of a good faith appeal, OSM is required to provide notice of its
determination to the permit applicant or other person challenging the link or the status of the violation. If an application
is pending, OSM must also notify the regulatory authority before whom the application is pending. Further, OSM is
required to correct information contained in AVS to reflect the determination which has been made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(2) of &sect;773.24 provides that, if OSM has determined that the challenged ownership or control link
has not been shown to be erroneous and has not been rebutted, and that the violation remains outstanding, OSM must provide
notice of its determination to the permit applicant or other person challenging the link or the status of the violation.
If an application is pending, OSM must also notify the regulatory authority before whom the application is pending.
Further, OSM is required to update information contained in AVS, if necessary, to reflect OSM's determinations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Paragraph (d)(2)(i) of &sect;773.24 provides that OSM must serve a copy of its decision with respect to a challenge
upon the applicant or other challenger by certified mail, or by any other means consistent with the rules governing
service of a summons and complaint under Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The regulation provides that
service is complete upon tender of the notice or of the mail and is not deemed incomplete by virtue of a challenger's
refusal to accept the notice or mail.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of &sect;773.24 provides that the applicant or other challenger can appeal OSM's decision
to the Department of the Interior's Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) within 30 days of such decision in accordance
with OHA regulations at 43 CFR 4.1380 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Paragraph (d)(2)(ii) further provides that OSM's decision remains in effect unless temporary relief was granted
in accordance with OHA regulations at 43 CFR 4.1386. The filing of an appeal will not automatically suspend the use
of the information in AVS during the pendency of such appeal. The challenger must explicitly seek such relief in appeal
proceeding before OHA.

Section 773.25 is a new section which establishes standards for challenges to ownership or control links and for challenges
to the status of violations. The section allocates responsibilities between OSM and State regulatory authorities
for resolving issues related to ownership and control and provides the standards for evidence to resolve such issues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a) of &sect;773.25 provides that provisions of &sect;773.25 are applicable to any challenge concerning
an ownership or control link to any person or the status of any violation covered by a violation notice when such challenge
is made under the provisions of 30 CFR 773.20 and 30 CFR 773.21 (improvidently issued permits); &sect;&sect;773.23
(the regulatory authority's review of ownership or control and violation information), and 773.24 (procedures
for challenging ownership or control links shown in AVS); or 30 CFR part 775 (administrative and judicial review of
permitting decisions).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) of &sect;773.25 provides the basic allocation of responsibility among regulatory authorities to
make decisions with respect to ownership or control and with respect to the status of violations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b)(1)(i) of &sect;773.25 provides that the regulatory authority before which an application is pending

Paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of &sect;773.25 provides that the regulatory authority that issued a violation notice, whether
State or Federal, has responsibility for making decisions concerning the status of the violation covered by the notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``status'' of the violation means whether the violation remains outstanding, has been corrected, is in the process
of being corrected, or is the subject of a good faith appeal, within the meaning of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b)(3)(i) of &sect;773.25 provides that with respect to information shown on AVS, the responsibilities

authority of OSM.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of &sect;773.25 provides that with respect to information shown on AVS relating to the status
of a violation and with respect to ownership or control information which has not been entered into AVS by a State, the
authority of a State regulatory authority is subject to OSM's oversight authority under 30 CFR parts 773, 842, and
843.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) of &sect;773.25 establishes evidentiary standards applicable to the formal and informal review of
ownership or control links and the status of violations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(1) of &sect;773.25 provides that in any formal or informal review of an ownership or control link or
of the status of a violation covered by a violation notice, the agency responsible for making a decision is required
to first make a prima facie determination or showing that the link exists, existed during the relevant period, and/or
that the violation remains outstanding. A prima facie determination is made when the agency is reviewing the evidence
itself, in an informal process; a prima facie showing is made when the agency's determination is the subject of a formal
administrative or judicial review process. When the agency makes such a determination or showing, the person seeking
to challenge the link or the status of the violation then has the burden of proving the necessary elements of his or her
challenge to the link or to the status of the violation by a preponderance of the evidence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under paragraph (c) of &sect;773.25, a challenger of a link has to prove at least one of three proposed conclusions
by a preponderance of the evidence to succeed in his or her challenge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of &sect;773.25, a challenger could prove that the facts relied upon by the responsible
agency to establish ownership or control under the definition of ``owned or controlled'' or ``owns or controls''
in 30 CFR 773.5 do not or did not exist or that the facts relied upon to establish a presumption of ownership or control
under the definition of ``owned or controlled'' or ``owns or controls'' in 30 CFR 773.5 do not or did not exist.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of &sect;773.25 provides that a person subject to a presumption of ownership or control under
the definition of ``owned or controlled'' or ``owns or controls'' in 30 CFR 773.5 could rebut such presumption by demonstrating
that he or she does not or did not in fact have the authority directly or indirectly to determine the manner in which surface
coal mining operations are or were conducted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of &sect;773.25 provides that a challenger could prove that the violation covered by a violation
notice did not exist, has been corrected, is in the process of being corrected, or is the subject of a good faith appeal
within the meaning of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). Paragraph (c)(1)(iii) further provides, however, that a person challenging
the status of a violation would not be able to challenge the existence of the violation at the time it was cited under
the provisions of &sect;773.24 unless such challenger is a permittee acting within the context of &sect;&sect;773.20&hyph;773.21
of this part. In any circumstance, a person who had failed to take timely advantage of a prior opportunity to challenge
the violation notice or who was bound by a previous administrative or judicial determination concerning the existence
of the violation would also be precluded from making a challenge to the existence of the violation at the time it was
cited in any proceeding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(2) of &sect;773.25 describes the type of evidence that a person challenging an ownership or control
link or the status of a violation has to present to meet the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence. The regulation
provides that the evidence presented be probative, reliable, and substantial. See 5 U.S.C. 556(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(2) of &sect;773.25 provides a list of examples of such evidence for proceedings before the ``responsible
agency'' (the agency with responsibility for making a decision with respect to a challenge) and for proceedings before
administrative or judicial tribunals reviewing the decisions of the responsible agency. The list of the types of
acceptable evidence is intended to be illustrative, not exhaustive. It is expected that regulatory authorities
will add to this list as they develop experience in making determinations under the regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(2)(i) of &sect;773.25 focuses upon proceedings before the responsible agency. The list of examples
includes documents which are likely to be truthful and which have certain indicators of reliability which go beyond
the mere assertions of the individual presenting the evidence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of the section provides that a challenger may submit affidavits setting forth specific facts
concerning the scope of responsibility of the various owners or controllers of an applicant, a permittee, or any person
cited in a violation notice; the duties actually performed by such owners or controllers; the beginning and ending
dates of such owners' or controllers' affiliation with the applicant, permittee, or person cited in a violation notice;
and the nature and details of any transaction creating or serving an ownership or control link; or specific facts concerning
the status of the violation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraphs (c)(2)(i)(B) and (c)(2)(i)(C) of section 773.25 each look to official certification as the basis for
the reliability of a submitted document. Paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B) allows for the submission of copies of certain types
of documents if they are certified. Such documents include copies of corporate minutes, stock ledgers, contracts,
purchase and sale agreements, leases, correspondence or other relevant company records. Paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C)
allows for submission of certified copies of documents filed with or issued by any State, municipal, or Federal governmental
agency.

Paragraph (c)(2)(i)(D) of final &sect;773.25 provides for a challenger's submission of an opinion of counsel in
support of his or her position. Such opinion would be appropriate for submission when it is supported by evidentiary
materials; when it is rendered by an attorney who certifies that he or she is qualified to render an opinion of law; and
when counsel states that he or she has personally and diligently investigated the facts of the matter or where counsel
states that such opinion is based upon information which has been supplied to counsel and which is assumed to be true.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of &sect;773.25 provides that, when the decision of the responsible agency is reviewed by an
administrative or judicial tribunal, the challenger could present any evidence to such tribunal which is admissible
under the rules of the tribunal. Under the regulation, however, the evidence submitted still has to be probative,
credible, and substantial.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d) of &sect;773.25 provides for the review and revision of information in AVS to reflect determinations
made by regulatory authorities in response to challenges of ownership or control links or the status of violations.
Paragraph (d) provides that, following any determination by a State regulatory authority or other State agency,
or following any decision by an administrative or judicial tribunal reviewing such determination, the State regulatory
authority shall review the information in AVS to determine if the information in AVS is consistent with the determination
or decision. If it is not consistent, the State regulatory authority is required to promptly inform OSM and request
that the AVS information be revised to reflect the determination or decision.

Paragraph (c) of 30 CFR 778.14 is amended to require a permit applicant to disclose ``all violation notices'' received
by the applicant within the preceding three years. In addition, the introductory language of the provision is amended
to require the disclosure of all outstanding violation notices for any surface coal mining operation that is deemed
or presumed to be owned or controlled by either the applicant or by any person who is deemed or presumed to own or control
the applicant under definitions of ``owned or controlled'' or ``owns or controls'' under 30 CFR 773.5.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulation previously required the applicant to disclose violations of a number of various laws listed in 30 CFR
778.14(c). Use of the amended definition of ``violation notice'' adopted today as part of 30 CFR 773.5 obviates the
need for listing each of these violations in 30 CFR 778.14.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulation also previously required that the applicant provide only a list of unabated cessation orders and unabated
air and water quality violation notices received prior to the date of the application by any surface coal mining and
reclamation operation owned or controlled by either the applicant or by any person who owns or controls the applicant.
With respect to this list, the previous regulation did not require that an applicant list notices of violation received
or unpaid penalties or fees incurred by any surface coal mining operation owned or controlled by the applicant or by
any person who owns or controls the applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) of &sect;778.14 is now amended to require an applicant to disclose all outstanding violation notices
received by any surface coal mining operation that is deemed or presumed to own or control the applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, OSM has amended paragraph (c) of &sect;778.14 to provide that for each notice of violation issued pursuant
to 30 CFR 843.12 or under a Federal or State program for which the abatement period has not expired, the applicant must
certify that such notice of violation is in the process of being abated to the satisfaction of the agency with jurisdiction
over the violation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Former &sect;843.10 is deleted since part 843 did not contain any information collection requirements which require
approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507. The references to &sect;&sect;843.14(c) and
843.16 formerly in &sect;843.10 did not represent information collection requirements. The requirement in &sect;843.14(c)
for OSM to furnish copies of notices and orders to the State regulatory authority and to any person having an interest
did not require OMB approval because the obligation to provide the information is imposed upon OSM and not upon the
State or upon a member of the public. Section 843.16 merely informs the public of the right to file an application for
review and request a hearing under 43 CFR part 4.

Section 843.24 is a new section which provides standards for OSM's oversight of State permitting decisions with respect
to ownership or control or the status of violations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a) of &sect;843.24 establishes the bases which require OSM to take action under the provisions of paragraphs
(b) and (c) of proposed &sect;843.24. Paragraph (a) provides that OSM is required to take action whenever it determines,
through its oversight of the implementation of State programs, that a State has issued a permit without complying
with the State program equivalents of proposed &sect;&sect;773.22 (verification of ownership or control application
information), 773.23 (review of ownership or control and violation information), 773.24 (procedures for challenging
ownership or control links shown in AVS), 773.25 (standards for challenging ownership or control links and the status
of violations), and &sect;843.23. As has been explained previously, OSM has deferred action on adopting proposed
&sect;843.23 at this time. The reference, however, to that proposed rule has been placed in &sect;843.24 in the event
that &sect;843.23 is adopted. The use of such reference does not mean, however, that OSM will ultimately adopt proposed
&sect;843.23.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If, as a result of determination made under paragraph (a) of &sect;843.24, OSM has reason to believe that the State
has issued a permit improvidently within the meaning of 30 CFR 773.20, paragraph (b) of &sect;843.24 requires OSM
to initiate action under 30 CFR 843.21.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) of &sect;843.24 provides for remedial actions by OSM against a State which knowingly fails to comply

Numerous comments were made which addressed various issues with respect to the overall rulemaking. While such comments
also invoked particular sections of the proposed rules, these comments asserted several central themes which went
beyond particular sections of the rulemaking even through specific sections of the proposed rulemaking were referenced
as areas of concern by the commenters. Accordingly, OSM has decided to address these central issues in this portion
of the preamble. Within the context of such discussion, particular sections of the proposed and final rules will be
referred to as necessary. Nevertheless, in these responses, OSM focuses upon central issues which appear to be of
overarching concern to the commenters.

Due Process
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Industry commenters asserted that the proposed rules violated due process and the underlying principles of the Act.
These commenters further argued that OSM's proposed rules violated due process principles because they did not allow
for a permit conditioned upon the outcome of an appeal of an ownership or control link, upon the challenge of the status
of the violation, or upon the challenge of the existence of the violation at the time it was cited. They also asserted
that because OSM did not allow for de novo challenges of the existence of violations by owners or controllers, the proposed
rules violated due process principles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM disagrees with these commenters' characterizations. The proposed rules and the rules which have been adopted
today provide detailed procedures to assure that those wishing to contest ownership or control links and the status
of violations may do so. Further, the proposed and final rules provide that decisions on these matters are made based
upon credible evidence and fair processes. Those seeking to challenge the existence of violations have the opportunity
to do so, incident to permit denial, in accordance with currently existing rules which predate this rulemaking. See
Preamble to Requirements for Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Permit Approval; Ownership and Control; Final
Rule, 53 FR 38868 at page 38885 (``Due Process Provided.'') (October 3, 1988). In addition, today's final rules clarify
that permittees may make such challenges within the context of the improvidently issued permit process. The procedures
provided in today's final rules supplement current rules contained at 30 CFR part 773 to provide more than sufficient
due process to protect the limited property interest a permit applicant has in the expectancy of a permit to engage
in surface coal mining operations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM does not believe that principles of due process mandate, as a necessary condition precedent to the denial of a permit
to an owner or controller of a violator, that the agency provide a full, formal, de novo hearing on the merits of an ownership
or control link, the existence of the violation at the time it was cited, and the status of the violation_followed by
an exhaustive appeal on each of these matters to the court of last resort. Instead, the final rules adopted today provide
due process commensurate with the limited interest of a permit applicant_the expectancy of permit issuance. OSM's
position is consistent with the agency's earlier statements relating to the sufficiency of due process and the protection
of property rights provided by the ownership and control rules and the AVS. See Preamble to Requirements for Surface
Coal Mining and Reclamation Permit Approval; Ownership and Control; Final Rule, 53 FR 38868 at page 38885 (October
3, 1988).

 on October 3, 1988, and the agency's implementation of AVS and those rules. In the briefs submitted by the Department
of the Interior in those cases, the Department analyzed relevant case law and carefully explained why the due process
criticisms were not well taken. Copies of these briefs are being placed in the Administrative Record of this rulemaking.
To the extent relevant, OSM incorporates the arguments advanced by the Department in those briefs herein by reference.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, OSM disagrees with the commenters' view that due process requires that conditional permits be made available
during the tendency of the appeal of an ownership or control link as a condition precedent to permit block. The final
rules published today provide ample protection for an owner or controller by providing the opportunity for an owner
or controller to challenge an ownership or control link. Further, the final rules provide for the Department's Office
of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) to grant temporary relief from a permit block, where, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the challenger has a substantial likelihood of prevailing on the merits of the appeal. OHA is contemporaneously publishing
final rules establishing procedures for the granting of temporary relief. Under OSM's final rules published today
and the OHA rules, the likelihood of the erroneous deprivation of a permit due to an erroneous link is minimal. An appellant
with a meritorious claim can get relief. Conditional permits for all appellants, without regard to the merits of their
claims, are unnecessary and unwarranted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, the final rules published today provide a measure of protection commensurate with the very limited interest
that a permit applicant has in his or her application for a permit. An applicant does not have a right to a permit to mine
coal in the same way that he or she has title to real property or a leasehold interest in a mineral lease. A permit to mine
coal is a privilege granted by the regulatory authority to those who have complied with the requirements of the Act
and the applicable regulatory program, including the provisions of Section 510(c) of the Act and the provisions of
30 CFR part 773. Until an applicant has been found in compliance with the applicable provisions of the program; until
the other provisions governing permit issuance have been satisfied; and until a permit has been issued, the applicant
has, at most, an expectation which may or may not be reasonable, depending upon the circumstances, that he or she will
qualify for permit issuance. Such an expectancy is highly speculative, continent, and limited. Investments based
on an expectancy do not transform the expectancy into a presently vested property right. See generally

In contrast to this, the agency's interest in and responsibility for implementing Section 510(c) of the Act is substantial
and must be balanced against the limited property interest of the permit applicant. OSM's ability to implement the
provisions of Section 510(c) of the Act is critical to the agency's enforcement of the Act. Those provisions of the
Act prevent violators from receiving new permits and, thus, from injuring the environment at new surface coal mining
operations. Those provisions of the Act encourage abatement of violations and deter operators and their owners or
controllers from committing violations. Potential applicants fear permit denial in the future. Therefore, such
applicants are motivated to prevent or abate violations in the present. Thus, OSM has a substantial interest in the
successful, credible implementation of Section 510(c) of the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If conditional permits were allowed during the pendency of a prolonged appellate process challenging an ownership
or control link, the agency's ability to enforce the provisions of section 510(c) of the Act and the ownership and control
rules would be severely compromised. Rather than abate the violations of their owned or controlled operations, it
is possible that some applicants would routinely appeal ownership or control links without regard to the strength
of the link as demonstrated by a full proceeding on the merits. Such applicants would appeal merely for the purpose
of gaining conditional permits. Depending upon how long the appeals process ran, an operator with a conditional permit
could extract a significant portion of the coal in a permitted mine and would have no incentive to abate the violations
of the surface coal mining operation to which he had been linked. The Act does not contemplate such a result; nor does
the Constitution require it.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, such a result would provide an unfair competitive advantage to an unscrupulous operator to the detriment
of the interests of the other members of the coal industry, the majority of whom take responsibility for environmental
reclamation and are responsible corporate citizens.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nevertheless, industry commenters have asserted that there is little likelihood of operators making frivolous
or bad faith ownership or control appeals because they have significant investments in their surface coal mining
operations. While OSM recognizes that this is probably true for the majority of operators, including those who have
provided comments on the proposed rules, experience has shown that a small minority of irresponsible operators can
create harm disproportionate to their numbers. In the process, such irresponsible operators do harm not just to OSM's
effective implementation of the Act, but also to the reputation of the industry as well.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For instance, a marginal operator's significant investment in coal extraction equipment may mask his/her plan to
avoid spending resources on reclamation. Indeed, there could be a serious economic temptation for such an operator
to protect a significant investment by appealing, if such appeal would support the continuation of operations. Accordingly,
OSM considers the extent of an applicant's investment in a surface coal mining operation to be an unreliable indicator
of an applicant's motive in initiating an appeal. Thus, OSM declines to develop a process requiring the evaluation
of operators' good faith based upon their comparative investments in surface coal mining operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM does recognize, however, that a permittee has an interest in his permit deserving of a higher level of protection
than that of an applicant with respect to an application. A valid permit represents more than the mere expectancy represented
by an application. A current, valid permit represents legal authorization to conduct surface coal mining operations
in accordance with the terms of such permit. See section 506 of the Act. Further, a permit carries with it the right of
successive renewal. See section 506(d)(1) of the Act; 30 CFR 774.15. Thus, a detailed process governing improvidently
issued permits has been established which recognizes this interest. See 30 CFR 773.20; 773.21. In response to concerns
asserted by industry with respect to due process, OSM has amended the regulations governing improvident permit issuance
to provide that a permittee can challenge the existence of the violation at the time it was cited as part of the improvidently
issued permit process. See 773.20(b)(2). OSM has done this in recognition of the more substantial interest that a
permit represents in contrast to the limited interest represented by a permit application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industry commenters have further asserted that an owner or controller must be afforded the opportunity to challenge
the validity of the existence of the violation at the time that it was cited as a condition precedent to the recommendation
of a denial of a permit application for an owner or controller of the violation. These commenters argued that owners
or controllers may not have had the opportunity to challenge the validity of the violation which forms the basis of
the permit denial at the time it was cited. They argued that only the actual violators were cited at that time and that
the owners or controllers would not have received notice in a timely manner to enable them to challenge the violation
then. They further asserted that a right to contest the merits of a violation after permit denial is not sufficient
to redress the harm caused by permit denial. Rather than face permit denial, they asserted that coal operators will
be forced to pay the disputed fees or to reclaim land. Accordingly, they asserted that they should be allowed to challenge
the violation prior to any permit denial.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM disagrees with those views. The rights of an owner or controller are well protected by the ability to challenge
the link to the violation. If the ownership or control link is not well taken, then the violation is irrelevant as a basis
for permit block. If the link is meritorious, the owner or controller would have been well-positioned to have had knowledge
in fact of the citations, if he or she desired such knowledge, see, e.g., 30 CFR 843.15(d), and to have compelled the
controlled surface coal mining operation to abate the violation or to challenge the violation in a timely manner.
See, e.g., 30 CFR 843.16(a). Accordingly, if an ownership or control link is well taken, the owner or controller has
already had an opportunity to challenge the violation or to abate the violation through the controlled entity. Under
these circumstances, OSM does not believe that an owner or controller is entitled to an additional opportunity to
challenge the existence of a violation before the regulatory authority can deny issuance of a permit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even so, the final rules promulgated today would not prohibit the challenge of the existence of the violation. Such
a challenge, however, must be made at the time of permit denial, rather than before, by persons who are not bound by prior
administrative or judicial proceedings with respect to the existence of the violation or who have not had a prior opportunity
to challenge the existence of the violation. This is entirely consistent with OSM's position as expressed in the preamble
to the ownership and control rules published in 1988. See Preamble to Requirements for Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation
Permit Approval; Ownership and Control; Final Rule, 53 FR 38868 at page 38885 (October 3, 1988).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Additionally, within the context of today's final provisions amending the regulations governing improvident permit
issuance, OSM has made explicit that a permittee may challenge the existence of the violation at the time it was cited.
A permittee may make such challenge if the challenge is not otherwise precluded by a permittee's previous failure
to take advantage of a prior opportunity to challenge or by a prior administrative or judicial determination concerning
the existence of the violation. See &sect;&sect;773.20 and 773.25.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nevertheless, the industry commenters questioned whether the ability to challenge a violation after permit denial
is illusory because OSM may attempt to argue that the owner or controller failed to take advantage of a prior opportunity
to challenge the violation at the time that it was issued or that the challenger was bound by a prior administrative
or judicial determination. This is not OSM's intent. Each specific case must be evaluated on its merits. In general,
a challenge would be precluded only when the facts indicate that a potential challenger has already had the opportunity
to challenge and has squandered it, or when the potential challenger is bound by a prior determination. The purpose
of this portion of the proposed rules and the final rules as adopted is to eliminate multiple repetitive opportunities
for challenge for those who have already had a substantive opportunity to challenge, either directly or through a
controlled entity. It is not OSM's intention to assert these defenses to a challenge unless such defenses are supported
by the facts of a particular case.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industry commenters argued that a State's decision to deny a permit based upon violation information contained in
AVS is also not subject to challenge. OSM disagrees. The existence of the violation at the time it was cited, along with
any other bases for permit denial, may be challenged in a proceeding under 30 CFR part 775, or the equivalent State programs,
subject to the defenses discussed above. To the extent that a regulatory authority has based its permit denial decision
upon violation information contained in AVS, that information would be an integral part of the challenge proceeding.
When administrative and judicial tribunals consider appeals of permit denials, it is probable that evidence related
to violations which form the basis of a permit denial will be relevant to the tribunal. OSM will work with State regulatory
authorities to provide supporting documentation if required for appeals of State permitting decisions. OSM anticipates
that State regulatory authorities will similarly cooperate with OSM and with each other in making such evidence related
to violation information available to administrative and judicial tribunals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industry commenters also asserted that the proposed rules, along with the ownership and control rules promulgated
in 1988, deny due process in that they retroactively impose responsibilities for violations upon owners and controllers.
Again, OSM must reject this characterization of the effect of the proposed rules and 1988 ownership and control rules.
OSM must further reject this characterization with respect to the final regulations adopted today. The ownership
and control rules published in 1988, the AVS-related proposed rules published in September, 1991, and the final rules
published today subject the owners or controllers of violations to permit denial for currently outstanding violations,
rather than past, abated violations. This obligation follows the clear mandate of section 510(c) of the Act which
requires the denial of permits when ``any surface coal mining operation owned or controlled by the applicant is currently
in violation'' of the Act or other laws cited.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, the presumptions of ownership and control provided by 30 CFR 773.5 and the final rules merely reflect the
reality that owners or controllers have the authority, by reason of their control at the time that the violations are
committed or during any period when the violations remained outstanding, to be aware of violations, to compel their
controlled entities to undertake timely challenges of violations, and to compel their controlled entities to abate
violations of the Act. Under these circumstances, there is no retroactive application of responsibility.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Moreover, the clear provisions of section 507(b)(4) of the Act require, in substance, that permit applicants identify
most of those people who are considered owners or controllers for purposes of section 510(c) of the Act and 30 CFR 773.15
and 773.5. As OSM observed in the preamble to the ownership and control rules published in 1988:

With the ownership and control rules published in October of 1988 and with these final rules published today, OSM is
simply implementing sections 510(c) and 507(b)(4) of the Act. None of these provisions impose retroactive responsibilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, related to their due process concerns, industry commenters argued that the proposed rules also violate
the Act by not providing conditional permits during the appeal of ownership or control links, the current status of
the violation, or the existence of the violation at the time it was cited. They pointed to the provisions of current
30 CFR 773.15(b)(2) which allow for a permit to be conditioned upon a good faith, direct administrative or judicial
appeal to contest the validity of the current violation as indicative of the agency's longstanding recognition that
such an appeal is consistent with the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM disagrees with the commenters' analysis and rejects the view that OSM's historic interpretation of the Act requires
that owners or controllers be entitled to permits conditioned upon the appeals of ownership or control links, the
status of the violation, or the existence of the violation at the time that it was cited.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM's regulation at 30 CFR 773.15(b)(2) does not constitute the agency's recognition that all appeals form the basis
for conditional permits. Such a blanket interpretation would negate the clear mandate of the provisions of section
510(c) of the Act and of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) which require the denial of permits to applicants who own or control surface
coal mining operations in current violation of the Act. As has been discussed previously in this preamble, the issuance
of permits conditioned upon the appeal of ownership or control links thwarts the effective implementation of section
510(c) of the Act. OSM has never interpreted its regulations to allow for such a result.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contrary to commenters' assertions, the regulation at 30 CFR 773.15(b)(2) only allows a limited exception for good
faith, direct administrative or judicial appeals contesting the validity of the violation as the basis for conditional
issuance. An appeal of an ownership or control link which tests a person's relationship to a violator or to a violation
does not test the validity of the underlying violation. To the extent that the provisions of a State program allow for
conditional issuance based upon the appeal of an ownership or control link, those provisions must be considered less
effective than comparable Federal provisions. See 30 CFR parts 730 and 732.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, in many instances, the existence of ownership or control links in AVS may be readily discovered by the presumed
controllers, and the accuracy of those links administratively challenged prior to the actual denial of a permit by
a regulatory authority. An appeal challenging the current status of a violation does not constitute a direct challenge
to the validity of the violation at the time that it was cited. Instead, it would test whether the violation is currently
abated or not.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An appeal as to the existence of the violation at the time it was cited could constitute a challenge as to the validity
of the violation. Nevertheless, there is nothing in the Act or OSM's regulations which requires that such an appeal,
undertaken by an owner or controller of a violator after standard appeal times have run, be the basis for conditional
issuance. Conditional issuance is particularly inappropriate when the controller's ability to compel the controlled
entity to act is taken into account. A controller has the capacity to force the controlled entity to abate or to appeal
and would have had such rights at the time that the violation was cited. Thus, a timely appeal of the violation, directly
made through administrative or judicial tribunals, could have been made at that time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter argued that due process protection in the proposed rules should be enhanced. In substance, this commenter
asserted that it is unfair to deny permits to applicants or to subject active permits to treatment as improvidently
issued permits where the applicants or permittees are subjectively unaware of their ownership or control links to
violators or of the import of such relationships. Accordingly, this commenter proposed that such persons should
have extended opportunities for ``corrections and questions'' without the risk of permit denial or revocation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM appreciates the commenter's suggestion, but does not believe that further proposed rules are needed or that amendments
to the final rules should be made to reflect the commenter's proposal. The AVS Office will work with anyone at any time,
including when there is no pending permitting action, to answer questions and make appropriate corrections to ownership
and control information in the database. Data in the system is available on-line to any interested party, and the AVS
Office will provide print-outs of AVS data on request. The AVS Office will also provide training to interested parties
on the use of the system. The AVS Office routinely works with major companies to insure that their ownership and control
information in the system is kept current. Given all these factors, there is no ``risk of permit denial'' necessarily
involved in the resolution of an ownership and control link.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, applicants and permittees are deemed to be aware of the law. The ownership and control rules were published
in October, 1988. Since that time, applicants and permittees could reasonably be expected to be aware of the regulations
and could have acted to cure any outstanding violations or to resolve any erroneous links in the AVS which would form
the basis for a permit denial or revocation. Thus, any ``unfair surprise'' to applicants or permittees posited by
the commenter is not an actual problem. Accordingly, it is entirely legitimate to deny permits to such applicants
or permittees when they are linked to violations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, permit applicants are required to provide full ownership and control information at the time of permit application.
See 30 CFR 778.13; 778.14. Permittees are required to update relevant ownership and control information in a timely
manner. See 30 CFR 774.17. Thus, the proposed remedy offered by the commenter is already a requirement of the rules.
Finally, in the unlikely event that a person has been unfairly subjected to permit denial by the process, that person
could still seek temporary relief from OHA in accordance with procedures governing such relief provided by OHA's
and OSM's regulations.

Primacy

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Industry and State commenters asserted a number of concerns relating to the impact of the proposed rules upon the primacy
of States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, industry commenters argued that the proposed rules and the AVS itself impermissibly substitute Federal
authority for State authority in the permitting process. They argued that, under the principle of State primacy,
once a State's program has been approved by OSM, the State should have sole authority for making decisions with respect
to permit issuance, including the determination of ownership and control matters. They asserted that requiring
a State to query the AVS before making a permitting decision takes the decision out of the hands of the State and transfers
substantive control of the decision to OSM which controls the content of the AVS. As evidence of this Federal control,
industry commenters cited, with disapproval, provisions of the proposed rules which provide that challenges of
ownership and control information on the AVS must be made to OSM.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM disagrees. First, in the cases of

 No. 81&hyph;2134 (D.D.C.), coal industry interests advanced similar primacy arguments attacking the agency's
ownership and control rules published in 1988. OSM responded to those arguments in detail demonstrating that the
ownership and control rules support State programs, rather than undermine them. Copies of these briefs are being
placed in the Administrative Record of this rulemaking. OSM incorporates the arguments advanced by the Department
in those briefs herein by reference.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, the purpose of AVS is to assist, rather than to undermine, the States in the exercise of their primary authority
for the implementation of their approved programs. The provisions of section 510(c) of the Act require that the regulatory
authority deny a permit to an applicant where ``information available'' to the regulatory authority indicates that
any surface coal mining operation owned or controlled by the applicant is currently in violation'' of the Act or certain
other governmental laws. See section 510(c) of the Act. In a State which has an approved program to regulate surface
coal mining operations pursuant to section 503 of the Act, neither OSM nor AVS decides whether or not to issue a permit
to an applicant in that State. The State regulatory authority is the decisionmaker.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contrary to the commenter's assertions, however, the Federal government has an ongoing role in this system of State
primacy. The Act and Federal regulations require that OSM assist the States in the implementation of their programs
under the Act and that OSM provide oversight of the State regulatory authorities' activities. See sections 102(g),
201(c), 503, 504, 505, and 521 of the Act; 30 CFR parts 732, 733, and 842.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with the State's role as primary decisionmaker, the AVS is a tool, developed by the Federal government
in concert with the States, which provides information in a convenient mode, readily accessible to State regulatory
authorities. It is a source of relevant ``information available'' of the type which the State regulatory authority
is required by the Act to consider when the State regulatory authority decides whether to issue a permit to conduct
surface coal mining operations. Absent AVS, a State regulatory authority would have to laboriously contact other
State regulatory authorities for violation and ownership and control information or would have to simply reply upon
the voluntary disclosure of information supplied by applicants or by public-spirited citizens. That OSM has taken
the lead in developing the AVS and in proposing to require to use of AVS through rulemaking is consistent with the Federal
government's role to assist and to oversee the State regulatory authorities. Even then, the content of AVS is the product
of the efforts of both State regulatory authorities and OSM working together to incorporate into AVS ownership and
control and violation information developed through their regulatory programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, a State's authority to make a decision with respect to a permit application is primary and is unimpaired
by anything in the proposed rules and by the State's use of AVS. To the extent that the rules support OSM's oversight
of the State's decisions, such oversight is mandated by and consistent with the provisions of the Act and the regulations
cited above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To the extent that the proposed rules provide that challenges of information already on AVS be made to OSM, such provisions
do not impair primacy. Instead, the rules recognize that the Federal government is uniquely situated to maintain
the accuracy and integrity of a nationwide database that will be used by many States. To be sure, each of the State regulatory
authorities has a valuable contribution to make to the quality of AVS information. Yet, the individual States may
have differing perspectives on ownership and control issues. The potential for inconsistency is significant_particularly
with respect to ownership and control decisions relating to multistate companies with complex organizational structures.
Also, potential challengers of such information need, if possible, a single point at which they can challenge ownership
or control information which will be used in many States and which, absent such a locus, could subject them to inconsistent
outcomes. Such a role for OSM is consistent with the role for the agency envisioned by SMCRA. See sections 201(c)(9)
and 201(c)(12) of SMCRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, it must be recognized that the decision to deny a permit because an operator is linked to a violation through
ownership or control can be an unpopular one, subjecting a local economy to stress. An operator may claim that he ``has
been put out of business'' by the State regulatory authority. This is one area where the Federal government can assist
the States by accepting the responsibility of maintaining ownership and control information which may ultimately
lead to permit denials in the various States. Federal acceptance of such a role helps to assure the integrity, consistency,
and accuracy of ownership and control information on the AVS. It is also consistent with one of the purposes of the Act
which is ``to insure that competition in interstate commerce among sellers of coal produced in different States will
not be used to undermine the ability of the several States to improve and maintain adequate standards of coal mining
operations within their borders.'' See section 101(g) of the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, even with the State using information on AVS as part of its information gathering incident to making a determination
with respect to a permit application, the State retains the authority, subject to Federal oversight, to decide whether
to issue the permit or not. Appeals of such a decision are made to the appropriate State reviewing tribunal, in accordance
with the provisions of the State program. Also, the final rules published today make clear that the State regulatory
authority which issues a permit has responsibility, subject to OSM's oversight, for determining the ownership or
control relationships of the permit. See &sect;773.25(b)(1)(ii). Contrary to commenters' assertions, the State's
use of AVS does not transmute the process into a Federal proceeding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To the extent that a State denies a permit based upon information in AVS indicating that the applicant is linked through
ownership or control to an outstanding violation of the Act, such denial is made based upon the mandate of section 510(c)
as implemented by the applicable State program, rather than some extraordinary Federal intervention in the State's
process. A State regulatory authority denying a permit based upon ownership or control information shown in AVS would
be obligated under the Act to take the same action based upon a phone call, letter, or other communication from another
regulatory authority advising of an applicant's ownership or control of a surface coal mining operation in current
violation of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, it must be emphasized that the cooperation of all regulatory authorities, including the States and OSM,
is necessary to facilitate the implementation of section 510(c) of the Act. Information on violations wherever they
have occurred is needed by each regulatory authority considering a permit application to ensure true compliance
with the provisions of section 510(c) of the Act. It is unreasonable, ineffective, and inefficient for each regulatory
authority to attempt to develop such information by itself. It is both reasonable and prudent for OSM to fulfill this
role. See sections 201(c)(9) and 201(c)(12) of SMCRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industry commenters further asserted that the proposed rules will have the effect of ``Balkanizing'' (i.e., dispersing)
regulatory authorities' permitting decisions. They were especially concerned about the provisions of &sect;773.26
of the proposed rules which allocated responsibility to particular regulatory authorities to make decisions with
respect to ownership or control relationships.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;773.26 allocated responsibility among the respective regulatory authorities such that the regulatory
authority before which an application is pending would have had authority for making decisions with respect to the
ownership or control relationships of the applicant; the regulatory authority that issued a permit would have had
authority for making decisions with respect to the ownership or control relationships of the permittee; the State
regulatory authority that issued a State violation notice would have had authority for making decisions with respect
to the ownership or control relationships of persons cited in the violation; and the regulatory authority that issued
a violation notice, whether State or Federal, would have had authority for making decisions concerning the status
of the violation covered by the notice. The proposed rule provided that these allocations of authority were subject
to OSM's oversight.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In substance, the industry commenters asserted that the provisions of this proposed section would impermissibly
weaken the authority of the State regulatory authority before whom a permit application is pending. They asserted
that the allocations of authority contained in the proposed rule would create confusion and delay in the permitting
process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM disagrees with these comments. The interaction between the Federal government and the States described above
does not constitute a ``balkanization'' of the permit application process. Nor will such interaction lead to confusion
in the permit application process. Such interaction is consistent with the mandate of SMCRA to implement section
510(c) within a context of State primacy supported by Federal oversight. The proposed rules and the final rules adopted
today attempt to establish a road map which is consistent with SMCRA for the making of decisions with respect to ownership
or control and for the development of information to be used in AVS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, the allocations of responsibility are consistent with the requirements of the Act. The provisions of section
510(c) of the Act mandate a separation of decisionmaking in the permit application process which commenters might
characterize as ``balkanization.'' The provisions of section 510(c) of the Act are very explicit in stating that
permits shall be denied to applicants who own or control surface coal mining operations with outstanding violations
of the Act ``until the applicant submits proof that such violation has been corrected or is in the process of being corrected
to the satisfaction of the regulatory authority, department, or agency which has jurisdiction over such violation.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, the Act contemplates that the State regulatory authority before which an application is pending could require
information from another State regulatory authority with respect to violations issued by the other State regulatory
authority before issuing a permit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Further, the Act is equally specific in establishing a mandated role for the Federal government to oversee the States
in the implementation of their State regulatory programs. See sections 201(c)(1); 503; 504; 505; and 521 of the Act.
Thus, to the extent that the proposed rules and the final rules adopted today envision the exercise of Federal oversight,
such a role is responsive to the provisions of SMCRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, while the proposed rule and the final rule, modified and renumbered as &sect;773.25, will be compared and
discussed in more detail below in this preamble, it is appropriate to offer some responses at this point since these
critical comments refer to the issue of relationships between governments. These comments invoke issues of State
primacy. Contrary to commenters' assertions, the rules in question allocate responsibility in a manner which is
supportive of, and consistent with, State primacy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For instance, the final rule provides that a State regulatory authority which issues a violation has responsibility,
subject to OSM oversight, for identifying the ownership and control relationships of the violation. See 30 CFR 773.25(b)(1)(iii).
The State regulatory authority which issues a violation has the greatest interest, among those regulatory authorities
with an interest in the ownership and control relationships of that violation, in seeing that the persons responsible
for the violation abate the violation. Such abatement directly improves the environmental quality of the State which
issues the violation. Accordingly, the State which issued a violation should have the first opportunity, subject
to Federal oversight, to identify the owners or controllers of the violation. Well before OSM made its proposals in
September, 1991, which form the basis for today's final rules, both SMCRA and Federal regulations recognized that
a violation had to be corrected to the satisfaction of the agency that has jurisdiction over the violation, before
a permit could be issued by a regulatory authority. See section 510(c) of SMCRA; 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1)(i).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, today's final provisions further recognize the relative access to ownership and control information
that the interested regulatory authorities have at each stage of the process. The regulatory authority which issued
the violation is in the best position to investigate and to develop all of the relevant facts about the violation, including
the identification of those responsible for the violation. The violation was committed within the jurisdiction
of the regulatory authority which issued the violation. That regulatory authority has access to the actors on the
ground at the surface coal mining operation and would be able to question them to identify ownership and control information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A similar analysis can be offered in support of affording the agency before which an application is pending responsibility
for identifying the ownership and control of the application. This regulatory authority has the applicant before
it and can inquire of the applicant directly with respect to any ownership and control information contained in the
application. Thus, the regulatory authority before which an application is pending has responsibility, subject
to Federal oversight, to decide the ownership and control relationships of the application. See 30 CFR 773.25(b)(1)(i).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A regulatory authority which has issued a permit has ongoing authority for the permittee's surface coal mining operations
on the permitted site. Thus, this regulatory authority has responsibility, subject to Federal oversight, to decide
the ownership and control relationships of the permit. See 30 CFR 773.25(b)(1)(ii).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, OSM recognizes that the industry commenters are deeply troubled by any use of the AVS in the permit application
process and any application of OSM's ownership or control rules as contained at 30 CFR 773.5 and 773.15(b)(1). Nevertheless,
OSM has accepted the mandate of Congress to develop and implement the AVS because ``the AVS is essential to effective
enforcement of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 [SMCRA].'' See Report of the Senate Appropriations
Committee, Senate Report No. 103&hyph;114, at page 47 (July 28, 1993). Thus, the allocation of responsibilities
for the various regulatory authorities contained in the proposed rules and the final rules adopted today also attempt
to reflect the pragmatic realities of implementing a national computer system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once a decision has been made to go forward with a national computer system to aid the enforcement of section 510(c)
of SMCRA, certain pragmatic realities must be recognized. First, information will be coming to the computer system
from many sources. As each State regulatory authority analyzes ownership and control information contained in permit
applications and reports such information to AVS, such information is incorporated into AVS. A national computer
system requires centralized management and maintenance to assure the accuracy and consistency of information.
Centralized management provides a focus of responsibility when inaccuracies or technical problems are identified.
Accordingly, the Federal government, acting through OSM, has responsibility for such system management. At the
same time, the States are primary actors in the permit application process and critically important actors in the
development and the support of AVS. With respect to AVS, the States play a critical role in using the computer system
as an information resource in the permit application process and in supplying information to AVS gleaned from the
permit application process and other research.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with the need for centralized management of the database, OSM has such a role with respect to the AVS and
the information contained therein. As will be discussed below in the discussion of specific sections of the final
rules, one of the changes made from the September, 1991, proposal was to place language in the final rule clarifying
OSM's plenary role with respect to the content of ownership or control information in the AVS. See 30 CFR 773.25(b)(3)(i).
OSM will also have sole responsibility over the ownership and control relationships incident to Federal violations.
See 30 CFR 773.25(b)(2). Further, OSM will exercise oversight over State regulatory authorities' activities. See
30 CFR 773.25(b)(3)(ii). This role provided for OSM under the final rule, consistent with that proposed under the
proposed rule, recognizes that, under the Act, while the States are subject to Federal oversight, OSM is not subject
to the oversight of State regulatory authorities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The industry commenters asserted that the proposed rules will create confusion and conflict among the States with
the potential for conflicting decisions on ownership and control by multiple State regulatory authorities and OSM.
Again, OSM disagrees with the commenters' characterization of the effect of the rules. As indicated above, the proposed
rules and the final rules clearly allocate responsibility among the various regulatory agencies. The regulatory
authority before which an application is pending decides whether or not to issue a permit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM retains the authority to oversee the decision of the State. Indeed, OSM's role as controller of information already
on AVS and as overseer of State ownership or control decisions will reduce, not create, confusion and conflict by establishing
one final authority to make decisions in cases where disagreements among States might occur about information already
on AVS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the rules do not inappropriately disperse decisionmaking among State and Federal regulatory authorities
with respect to ownership and control. Further, prior to the publication of these final rules, OSM's AVS Office and
the States have worked well together to implement AVS and the ownership and control regulations promulgated in 1988.
To the extent that there have been disagreements between OSM's AVS Office and the State regulatory counterparts,
such disagreements have been addressed expeditiously and resolved in a collegial and cooperative manner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters expressed concern that the proposed rules did not sufficiently address the issues of conflicts between
the States and OSM and between the States themselves on matters of ownership and control. OSM believes that these issues
will be addressed adequately by the provisions of 30 CFR 773.25. That section is based upon proposed &sect;773.26
and establishes the relative responsibilities of agencies responsible for making ownership and control decisions.
As noted previously, this regulation is discussed in detail below. Within the framework of State primacy, OSM will
exercise its oversight role to review State ownership or control decisions, in response to citizen complaints or
as otherwise appropriate, to assure the integrity of the AVS. See 30 CFR 773.12; 842.11; and 843.21.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter asserted, in substance, that the proposed rules did not go far enough in imposing Federal responsibility.
This commenter proposed that all matters relating to ownership and control under section 510(c) of the Act should
be OSM's responsibility. While OSM appreciates the commenter's suggestion, OSM must reject this proposal. As OSM
indicated above, the Act establishes a system of State primacy with Federal oversight and assistance to the States.
While it is understandable that some persons would prefer that the entire responsibility for permit decisionmaking
be shouldered by the Federal government, such a system would require a significant restructuring of the statutory
framework established by the Act. In contrast to this, today's final rules address the responsibilities established
by section 510(c) of the Act in a manner more consistent with the statutory framework.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter questioned whether OSM had given adequate consideration to the implications of the rules upon Federal
and State relations. As the above discussion indicates, OSM has considered, in detail, the effect of AVS and these
rules upon the relationship between OSM and the State regulatory authorities and believes that the rules are consistent
with the framework for Federal and State relations established by the Act. Further, as indicated above, the working
relationship between OSM's AVS Office and its State colleagues has been heretofore very productive and cooperative.
OSM believes that State and Federal cooperation on AVS matters has been, overall, a significant success. Accordingly,
OSM intends to continue to work closely and cooperatively with State regulatory authorities to resolve issues related
to the implementation of AVS and section 510(c) of the Act.

Citizen Participation

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters representing environmental groups criticized the proposed rules as not containing sufficient provision
for citizen participation. They asserted that citizens should be afforded the opportunity to add ownership and control
links to AVS. They further argued that citizens should have appeal rights when the regulatory authority denies their
requests to add ownership or control links and that citizens should have rights of intervention when decisions are
made to sever links. They also urged that citizens should have explicit rights to request enforcement action with
respect to improvidently issued permits, with respect to other provisions of the rules relating to ownership and
control, and with respect to the imposition of sanctions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM strongly supports citizen participation and agrees that opportunities for citizen participation need to be
addressed in the rules governing ownership and control. OSM further agrees that the proposed rules did not sufficiently
address these issues in the September, 1991, proposal. Under the Administrative Procedure Act, however, the agency
has a responsibility to propose regulations for public comment, prior to finalizing such regulations. The changes
proposed by commenters would represent significant modifications of the September, 1991, proposals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, OSM does not consider it appropriate to incorporate commenters' proposals into today's final rules without
first providing opportunity for comment to the regulated community, the States, and the public generally. While
OSM could delay finalization of today's rules to allow for such proposal and for opportunity for comment, OSM does
not believe that the public interest would be served by such delay.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nevertheless, suggestions made by the commenters are worthy of further consideration. Accordingly, at some future
date, OSM may present proposals to respond to the concerns expressed by the commenters. Until such proposals are made,
however, the interests of concerned citizens should be asserted pursuant to the provisions of 30 CFR 773.13, 842.11,
842.12, 843.21 and other regulations providing for citizen participation, as appropriate. In this respect, if citizens
disagree with a decision of OSM finding that an ownership or control link does not exist, citizens can challenge such
decision by demanding a Federal inspection of relevant permits affected by such decision in accordance with the current
provisions of 30 CFR 842.12. If OSM rejects their demand to conduct an inspection, citizens can seek review of such
rejection and the issues related thereto pursuant to 30 CFR 842.15 to the Director or his designee and, if necessary,
to OHA in accordance with 43 CFR part 4.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, OSM's AVS Office will receive and consider ownership or control information from concerned citizens as
part of OSM's ongoing research activities to incorporate ownership or control and violation information into the
AVS database. Such information is relevant and will be used by the agency in the making of ownership or control determinations
and for inclusion, upon verification by the agency, into AVS. OSM strongly encourages concerned citizens, environmental
advocates, and members of the industry to come forward with information relevant to ownership or control matters.
It is in everyone's interest for the AVS to contain the most complete, comprehensive, and accurate information possible.

 In the proposed rule, OSM deleted the definition of ``violation notice'' previously contained in the regulations
and transferred such definition in expanded form to &sect;773.5. The final rule is identical to the proposed rule.
As described below, the definition of ``violation notice'' refers to the types of violations of the Act or other laws
which will form the basis for a regulatory authority to deny a permit application under the provisions of &sect;773.15(b).

 In the proposed rule, OSM had included an amendment to the Table of Contents to provide for a proposed rule governing
procedures for the challenge of ownership or control links prior to entry in AVS. Since OSM has determined not to go
forward with that portion of the proposal, that reference is not included in the final Table of Contents adopted today.
Also, since OSM has deferred action with respect to the adoption of proposed &sect;773.27 to a subsequent rulemaking,
that reference has also been deleted. The final Table of Contents is adopted as described in Summary of Rules Adopted.

 The proposed rule added certain definitions to &sect;773.5. Such definitions included the terms ``Applicant/Violator

``Violation notice.'' Such definitions were necessary to an understanding of the proposed comprehensive regulations
relating to the implementation of AVS.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Industry commenters objected that the proposed definition of ``violation notice'' contained in the regulation
was too broad. They argued that the proposed definition, insofar as it applies to a ``Federal violation notice'' should
be explicitly limited to violations of environmental laws. Further, they asserted that the definition inappropriately
included written communications and demand letters as ``violations.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM disagrees with the commenters' concern over the need for an explicit limitation for violations of environmental
laws in the definition of a ``Federal violation notice.'' Commenters conceded that such a limitation is already contained
in the proposed definition of ``violation notice.'' The definition of a Federal violation notice is modified by any
limitations contained in the definition of a violation notice. Accordingly, there is no need for an explicit additional
limitation to address commenters' concerns. It is already clear that it is limited to violations of environmental
laws. Thus, OSM has adopted the proposed definition of ``Federal violation notice'' as a final definition without
modification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, commenters asserted that the proposed rule inappropriately expanded the definition of violation notice
to include various written communications and demand letters. They asserted that a demand letter could somehow preclude
a permit applicant from pursuing a good faith appeal and that a person's ability to challenge the debt would depend
on whether the agency attempted to collect the debt. In substance, commenters took exception to the prospect of a demand
letter being the basis for a permit denial when the demand letter contains notice of a delinquent civil penalty and
the applicable statute of limitations has expired precluding further action to collect the debt. They asserted that
the proposed rule impermissibly expands the types of violations for which a person could be subject to permit block
without affording the person a right of timely challenge.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Again, OSM disagrees with commenters' analysis. First, it must be emphasized that the type of document is less significant
than the violation of which it provides notice. The document is merely a vehicle for communicating notice of the substantive
violation. The documents listed in the proposed definition merely recount the possible types of documents providing
notice and do not substantively expand the universe of violations which would be the basis for permit denial under
section 510(c) of the Act and the provisions of 30 CFR 773.15(b). The substantive violation, rather than the type of
document, forms the basis for a permit denial under the provisions of section 510(c) of the Act and 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1).
Pursuant to those provisions, a regulatory authority is required to refuse permit issuance where available information
indicates that any surface coal mining operation owned or controlled by an applicant is currently in violation of
the Act or other indicated laws. Delinquent fees or penalties which have ripened to the level for which a demand letter
is indicated constitute available information for which an applicant will be held accountable and which a regulatory
authority must take into account in any permit decision. Contrary to commenters' assertions, the filing of a suit
to collect delinquent reclamation fees or civil penalties is not a condition precedent to such debts being valid violations
or a condition precedent to such debts being considered the bases for permit denial.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the commenters' concerns about rights of challenge incident to demand letters, OSM believes that
current quality control procedures will prevent the entry of unripe violations into the system. Furthermore, with
this final rule and with OHA's rule which is being contemporaneously published, OSM and OHA have acted to provide a
means for applicants to obtain temporary relief from permit blocks where they are likely to prevail on the merits.
Thus, if a violation has not actually ripened into the basis for a permit block, temporary relief could be sought. The
discussion of these provisions of the final rule are contained at the discussion of 30 CFR 773.25 below in this preamble.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industry commenters also objected to the prospect that a demand letter or other notice could contain notice of a delinquent
civil penalty the collection of which is barred by the applicable statute of limitations. In substance, they argued
that such a notice should not be the basis for a permit denial. OSM disagrees. In 1988, OSM addressed similar concerns
expressed by commenters with respect to the ownership and control rules. OSM stated, in relevant part, as follows:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A commenter asserted that permit blocking cannot occur for any civil penalty which has not been reduced to judgment
within the applicable statute of limitations in 28 U.S.C. 2462 (barring an action, suit or proceeding for enforcement
of any civil fine, penalty unless commenced within five years).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
OSMRE disagree[s] with the commenter's position. Although the statute of limitations may provide a defense to suit
for collection of money filed five years following the entry of a final order, it does not invalidate the final order
or cancel the underlying debt, which will continue to be listed in the Applicant Violator System and will result in
blocking the issuance of a permit.

Rule, 53 FR 38868 at page 38884 (October 3, 1988). The agency considers this position to be sound and has no intention
of changing course. Accordingly, this criticism of the proposed definition is rejected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commenters representing industry interests asserted that the definition of violation contained in the
rule was overbroad in that it potentially included violations of laws other than SMCRA as the basis for permit denial.
These commenters proposed that the rule incorporate explicit limitations to the effect that only violations relevant
to SMCRA or consistent with the environmental protection standards of SMCRA be the basis for permit denial.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM rejects the commenters' proposals as unnecessary. To the extent that the final definition of ``violation notice''
describes the type of violation for which the listed types of notice will be provided, the final rule is intended to
track the language of section 510(c) of the Act. That provision of the Act states that the basis for permit denial includes
violations of the Act ``and any law, rule or regulation of the United States, or of any department or agency in the United
States pertaining to air or water environmental protection 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
incurred by the applicant in connection with any surface coal mining operation *&blank;*&blank;*'' (Emphasis added.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters' concerns are already addressed by the Act and the proposed and final definitions of ``violation notice''
which incorporate the above-emphasized language of the Act. This language requires that violations which support
permit denial must be those pertaining to air or water environmental protection incurred in connection with any surface
coal mining operation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Any air or water environmental protection violations incurred in connection with a surface coal mining operation
would be of a type ``relevant to SMCRA.'' If the violations are committed not in connection with a surface coal mining
operation, they would not be a basis for the denial of a permit under section 510(c) of the Act. Thus, OSM does not believe
that a change in the proposed rule language to reflect commenters' concern is needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter representing certain State regulatory authorities also criticized the proposed definition of ``violation
notice'' as being too broad and was concerned that such definition, when read with the provisions of 30 CFR 778.14(c),
would lead to ``nationwide gridlock'' or undue delay in State regulatory authorities' processing of permit applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed definition of ``violation notice'' is designed to incorporate the full range of violations which would
form the basis for permit denial under section 510(c) of SMCRA. The definition is intended to implement the statutory
definition, not expand such definition. A more limited definition would be an impermissible constraint upon the
broad language of the Act. Accordingly, OSM rejects the view that the proposed definition is overbroad.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM further disagrees with commenter's view that applicants' reporting of such violation notices in accordance
with the provisions of 30 CFR 778.14(c) will lead to undue delay in the processing of permit applications. Applicants
must supply complete information with respect to outstanding violations to enable regulatory authorities to make
informed decisions as to permit issuance as mandated by section 510(c) of the Act and 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). The reporting
of such information by an applicant may, indeed, lead to permit denial. That, however, constitutes with the mandates
of the Act, not inappropriate delay or stalemate. OSM is confident that OSM and Sate regulatory authorities can evaluate
and use the information provided by applicants with respect to outstanding violations in accordance with the definitions
of ``violation'' and ``violation notice'' along with information contained in AVS to meet the requirements of the
Act in a timely fashion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The same commenter additionally urged that OSM retain the limited definition of ``violation notice'' previously
contained in 30 CFR 701.5 because such definition is more ``realistic'' in its scope and because there is a need for
such a definition across OSM's regulations, not just those contained in 30 CFR part 773.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Again, OSM disagrees with commenter's views. The definition of ``violation notice'' previously contained in the
regulations did not identify the types of violations of the Act or other laws which would form the basis for a regulatory
authority to deny a permit under 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). A fuller definition of the term which would encompass these types
of violations as mandated by section 510(c) of the Act was necessary for incorporation by reference into a proposed
amended version of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). While commenter has asserted that there is a need for a general definition
of the term ``violation notice'' across OSM's regulations, commenter has identified no urgent need for a universal
definition of the term that would outweigh the need to clarify the provisions of 30 CFR part 773. Further, in the event
that it becomes apparent that the implementation of other regulations have been somehow significantly compromised
by the deletion of the general definition of ``violation notice'' contained in 30 CFR 701.5, OSM can address these
issues as necessary. Accordingly, OSM must reject the commenter's position.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, a commenter urged that any violations be in a final, unappealable posture before they can be the basis for
permit denial. OSM disagrees with the commenter's characterization of the current state of the law and with what the
commenter believes ought to prevail.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, Federal regulations which predate the proposed rules and today's final rules already provide that permits
may be conditionally issued based upon a good faith, direct administrative or judicial appeal testing the validity
of the underlying violation. See 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1)(ii)&hyph;(b)(2). Thus, contrary to commenter's implication,
permits are not necessarily denied while violations are under appeal. The burden, however, is on a violator to assert
appeal rights in good faith and in a timely manner. There is no legitimate reason to afford additional appeal rights
to people who have squandered their opportunity to appeal. In the absence of a timely appeal, a violation should be
the basis for denial of a permit, in accordance with the provisions of section 510(c). In this preamble under the topic
captioned ``Due Process,'' OSM has responded in detail to commenters who have asserted that permits should be conditioned
upon the appeals of ownership or control links or upon the appeals of the existence of the violation asserted by owners
or controllers of violations after standard appeal times for the violations have run. As stated in this preamble,
OSM rejects these assertions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To the extent that the commenter implied that permits should be issued unconditionally during the pendency of an appeal
of a violation, OSM also rejects this proposal. Under this proposal, a violator could commit a violation at his or her
surface coal mining operation; take a timely appeal; and then be approved unconditionally for permit issuance at
another site. Following the failure of his or her appeal, he or she could continue to mine on the new site with no interruption
or termination of his or her rights on the new site. This course of events violates the provisions of section 510(c)
of the Act which mandate that regulatory authorities deny permits when applicants have current violations of the
Act or other laws. Also, the commenter's proposal is inconsistent with the provisions of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1)(ii)&hyph;(b)(2)
cited above which allow only conditional issuance, rather than unconditional issuance, for permits issued to applicants
who have appealed outstanding violations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In that final rule, OSM has adopted the definitions of ``Federal violation notice'' and ``violation notice'' as proposed
and without any of the changes requested by commenters.

In the proposed rule, the definition of ``ownership or control link'' included references to ownership or control
``under paragraph (b)'' of 30 CFR 773.5. Since the publication date of that proposal, OSM has proposed changes in the
definitions of ``owned or controlled'' or ``owns or controls'' contained at 30 CFR 773.5. See Proposed Rule, Definitions

(June 28, 1993). If some of those proposed changes are ultimately adopted, the reference to ownership or control as
defined by ``paragraph (b)'' contained in the proposed definition of ``ownership or control link'' would be inappropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, to assure flexibility, OSM has deleted the reference to ``paragraph (b)'' of 30 CFR 773.5 from the final
definition of ``ownership or control link.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, the proposed definition of ``ownership or control link'' indicated that a link included presumptive ownership
or control relationships which had not ``been successfully rebutted under the provisions of &sect;&sect;773.24
and 773.26 or &sect;&sect;773.25 and 773.26 or under the provisions of part 775 of this chapter and &sect;773.26 of
this part.'' As is discussed below in this preamble, OSM has deleted proposed section 773.25, procedures for challenging
ownership or control links prior to entry in AVS and has renumbered proposed &sect;773.26 as final &sect;773.25,
standards for challenging ownership or control links and the status of violations. The final definition of ``ownership
or control link'' has been amended to reflect these changes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rules are adopted containing the provisions described in this preamble above at 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Summary of Rules Adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 773.10_Information Collection. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would have revised &sect;773.10 which contained a list of the existing information collection
requirements in part 773 and also the OMB clearance number indicating OMB approval of the information collection
requirements. The proposed rule revision would have updated &sect;773.10 by including the proposed AVS-related
rules containing information collection requirements. The proposed revision provided an estimate of the average
public reporting burden per response of three hours, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing
data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.
The proposed section also listed the addresses for OSM and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) where comments
on the information collection requirements may be sent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industry commenters asserted that the estimate of three hours to prepare an average response for the collection of
information required was unrealistically low.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM disagrees with commenters' assertion. The three hours estimated burden was an estimated average, rather than
a predicted figure for the burden of a single, typical response. The calculation of an ``average'' response means
that there are some responses which may require larger amounts of time to prepare and that there are also some responses
which may require significantly lesser amounts of time. It is entirely reasonable to expect that the reporting and
information collection burden of these regulations may vary among entities depending upon the entities' size and
structural complexity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, once companies have researched and compiled their particular ownership or control information, they have
done the basic research which can be used for future compliance. This basic ownership or control research will then
be readily available to the company and the company only needs to update such research to reflect changes in ownership
or control for future applications. Once entities and regulatory authorities develop experience in complying with
the regulations, they will also develop experience in collecting, storing, retrieving, and reporting the necessary
compliance information. A number of large companies have told OSM that they have already collected and stored their
ownership or control information in a computerized database or are in the process of doing so. Once such information
has been so stored, it would be readily accessible and easily retrieved for compliance purposes. Thus, the amount
of time required to prepare a typical response under these regulations should diminish over time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nevertheless, in the final rule adopted today, OSM has recalculated the estimated time for compliance in accordance
with standard procedures required by the OMB. OSM has concluded that the public reporting burden for the collection
of information required by part 773 as amended by these final regulations is four and one half hours per response, rather
than three hours. The final rule also has been modified to delete specific references to the particular sections of
part 773 which are relevant for information collection purposes. Instead, OSM has provided a reference to the collection
of information required by 30 CFR part 773, since this part encompasses all sections of part 773, including the final
rules adopted today, which generate an information collection obligation.

Section 773.15_Review of permit applications.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the proposed rule. OSM proposed to amend 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) to refer to relevant amended definitions and AVS-related
rules as the basis for a regulatory authority's analysis when reviewing a permit application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulation required the regulatory authority to review all reasonably available information concerning
violation notices and ownership or control links involving the applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such information would include that obtained pursuant to &sect;773.22 (verification of ownership or control application
information); &sect;773.23 (review of ownership or control and violation information); amended &sect;778.13
(identification of interests); and amended &sect;778.14 (violation information).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While those regulations will be discussed in detail later in this preamble, the net effect of referencing such provisions
in &sect;773.15(b)(1) was to assure that the regulatory authority makes a decision with respect to permit issuance
or denial based upon complete information relating to ownership, control, and violations. Such compete information
includes the mandated use of AVS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would have further added a paragraph (b)(4) to 30 CFR 773.15. This provision would have provided
that delinquent civil penalties for violations cited prior to October 3, 1988, not form the basis for a permit block
against persons linked through ownership or control to such violations, where reclamation had been completed in
accordance with the provisions of the applicable regulatory program and where, with respect to each cessation order
for which a delinquent civil penalty exists, such persons had paid $750 of the amount of such penalty to the regulatory
authority which issued such cessation order. In substance, this regulation proposed a ``safe harbor'' with respect
to owners or controllers of delinquent civil penalties cited prior to October 3, 1988.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the proposed amendments to 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) would also have deleted the presumption contained in
the then current version of that rule that allows a regulatory authority, in evaluating whether a surface coal mining
operation owned or controlled by a permit applicant is currently in violation of the law, to presume, in the absence
of a failure to abate cessation order (FTACO), that a notice of violation (NOV) has been or is being corrected, except
where evidence to the contrary is set forth in the permit application, or where the notice of violation is issued for
non-payment of abandoned mine reclamation fees or civil penalties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the proposed amendment to 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) would have incorporated by reference the amended definition
of ``violation notice'' and the proposed definition of ``ownership or control link'' contained in proposed &sect;773.5
by requiring a regulatory authority to review ``all reasonably available information concerning violation notices
and ownership or control links involving the applicant.'' This proposed change would have eliminated the need for
the detailed list contained in 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) of the types of violation information which a regulatory authority
must review as part of the application review process provided by 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The two issues which generated the most significant comments were the proposed deletion of the presumption of NOV
abatement and the proposed safe harbor for owners or controllers of surface coal mining operations with delinquent
civil penalties for violations issued prior to October 3, 1988.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first of these issues to be addressed is the proposed deletion of the presumption of NOV abatement. Commenters
representing a number of State regulatory authorities strongly objected to the deletion of the presumption. They
asserted that the elimination of the presumption would lead to ``nationwide gridlock.'' They asserted that such
a rule provision would lead to automatic appeals of all NOV's; that State regulatory authorities would have to expend
significant resources tracking the course of NOV's and NOV appeals; that companies operating before multiple State
regulatory authorities would never be able to definitively prove that NOV's were being abated such that they could
be issued permits; and that such efforts would be a significant waste of State and Federal resources. They asserted
that 80%&hyph;85% of all NOV's are resolved and never ripen into CO's in any event.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, commenters representing industry interests strongly criticized the proposed deletion of the NOV presumption
as both impractical and counterproductive. They asserted that the proposed deletion of the presumption would be
especially burdensome on large multi-state corporations. They questioned whether such entities would be able to
keep track of the abatement status of the NOV's of their many operating subsidiaries and contract miners. They further
asserted that most NOV's are routinely and timely abated. They argued that eliminating the NOV presumption would
lead to information overload in the permit application process; to increased costs and delays in permit processing;
and to increased errors in data collection. They argued that the deletion of the presumption would require the reallocation
of personnel from enforcement to document processing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In contrast to the positions of State regulatory authorities and the industry, one commenter representing environmental
advocacy groups supported the deletion of the NOV presumption, asserting that the deletion of the presumption would
lead to better tracking of the status of violations and to faster remediation of violations. Another commenter did
concede, however, that it would be difficult for the OSM to keep AVS accurate and current with respect to violation
information if the presumption of NOV abatement in the absence of an FTACO was eliminated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM considers the arguments raised by the State regulatory authorities and by the industry to be persuasive. OSM must
give particular consideration to the concerns expressed by the State regulatory authorities on this issue. These
agencies have the responsibility of implementing the ownership and control process. If the State regulatory authorities
believe that the complete elimination of the presumption of NOV abatement will impose a significantly increased
burden upon them for limited environmental return, this position cannot be discounted. OSM recognizes that there
may be a potential benefit in having multiple jurisdictions tracking the course of NOV's for purposes of permit issuance.
Such multiple supervision could theoretically encourage prompt abatement. Nevertheless, the mechanics of implementing
such a process through AVS and other means would be sufficiently complex so as to create significant uncertainty among
permit applicants and regulatory authorities. Such uncertainty outweighs the benefits of the complete elimination
of the presumption of NOV abatement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the environmentalists' arguments, OSM recognizes that there is a theoretical, potential benefit
in multiple regulatory authorities tracking the course of an NOV for purposes of permit issuance. Under this scenario,
a State would deny a permit to an applicant based upon his or her being linked through ownership or control to an NOV in
another State even though the abatement period for the NOV had not expired. The threat of permit denial could enhance
the prospect for prompt abatement of that NOV.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Nevertheless, the mechanics of implementing this process with respect to AVS would be complex and would create such
uncertainty as to outweigh the benefits. Assuming that NOV's whose abatement period had not yet expired and which
had not yet generated FTACO's were loaded onto AVS, OSM would have to check the status of such NOV's and continually
update such information on AVS. It is unclear whether OSM would be able to keep up with the changing status of NOV's and
incorporate such information in a timely manner into AVS. This would add an additional element of uncertainty with
respect to the currency of violation information in AVS. OSM believes it is more desirable to have information in AVS
which is both current and reliable, so that State regulatory authorities may depend on the system during the permit
application review process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, OSM believes that the decision to retain at least a limited presumption of NOV abatement is consistent with
positions taken by the Department of the Interior in previous litigation. In litigation relating to &sect;773.15(b)(1)
and related matters before the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia, the Secretary advised the court that
he had decided to reconsider the issue of whether, in the absence of an FTACO, the regulatory authority may presume
that an NOV has been or is being corrected. The Secretary further advised the court that he would, if appropriate, engage
in further rulemaking on the subject as expeditiously as possible. See

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated in the preamble to the proposed rule, the proposed amendment to delete the presumption of NOV abatement
represented the ``further rulemaking'' of which the court was advised. However, the Secretary committed only to
reconsider the presumption of NOV abatement. The Secretary never committed to finalize any proposed rule. After
receiving the States' and industry's comments cited above, OSM has determined that the complete deletion of the presumption
would impose a significant burden upon the States and provide little enforcement benefit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated in the preamble to the September, 1991 proposed rule, it was, in fact, never OSM's intention to load NOV's
(other than delinquent NOV civil penalties) into the AVS database, given the large volume of data entry that would
be required to keep such violation information up to date. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Id.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Thus, even if OSM had completely deleted the presumption of NOV abatement by adopting the proposed modification to
30 CFR 773.15(b)(1), there would have been no immediate, direct impact upon the AVS database. If OSM had eliminated
the presumption, there would have been, however, a significant indirect impact upon AVS. The States would have been
required to spend scarce resources tracking other States' NOV's, including those whose abatement periods had not
yet expired, for permit application purposes. The States would have had fewer resources available to focus upon the
other information that AVS believes is more critical to the effective implementation of section 510(c) of the Act,
including the development of complete information with respect to entities' ownership and control. Further, OSM
is committed to making its best effort to provide, through the AVS, a complete list of violations which are required
to be used as the basis for a permit block.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, OSM has determined to retain a presumption of NOV abatement in 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). The focus of State
regulatory authorities' concern appears to be the uncertainty incident to NOV's with abatement periods which have
not yet expired. In substance, where an NOV has been issued and the abatement period has not yet expired, it is uncertain
whether the violation will be ultimately abated or will ripen into the basis for the issuance of a failure to abate cessation
order. The State regulatory authorities and the coal industry argue that such uncertainty justifies unconditional
permit issuance. The environmentalists argue that such uncertainty demands permit denial. While OSM recognizes
the needs of the State regulatory authorities, OSM believes that environmental advocates have also asserted legitimate
concerns about the consequences of a blanket presumption of abatement for all NOV's. OSM has therefore chosen a middle
ground which will serve to reduce the uncertainty while balancing the concerns of the various interests.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the comments made to its proposal, OSM has amended 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) to provide that, in the absence
of a failure-to-abate cessation order, a regulatory authority may presume that a notice of violation is being corrected
to the satisfaction of the agency with jurisdiction over the violation where the abatement period for such notice
of violation has not yet expired and where the permit applicant has provided certification in his or her permit application
that such violation is in the process of being corrected to the satisfaction of the agency with jurisdiction over the
violation. Where OSM is regulatory authority, OSM will incorporate such certification into the statement of verification
currently required in OSM's permit applications. Any permits issued incident to such certification will be conditionally
issued based upon successful completion of the necessary abatement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The above approach balances the concerns of the commenters. A blanket presumption of abatement for all NOV's_including
those whose abatement period has expired_is inappropriate. It is entirely possible that there are NOV's with expired
abatement periods for which cessation orders have not yet been written. To presume that such NOV's are abated is unjustified.
At the same time, today's final rule recognizes that, until the abatement period has expired, diligent operators
should have the opportunity to correct their NOV's in a timely manner without being subjected to permit denial during
the period of abatement if they certify that such violations are in the process of abatement. State regulatory authorities
can conserve limited resources by having the benefit of a reasonable presumption of NOV abatement which applies to
those NOV's which are in a true state of uncertainty with respect to abatement. In considering whether a particular
NOV should be the basis for permit denial, State regulatory authorities will also have the comfort of certification
by the applicant and the protection of conditional issuance to assure that any representations made with respect
to NOV abatement are actually fulfilled.

OSM recognizes that some large companies may not be aware of all NOV's whose abatement periods have not expired where
such NOV's are cited against one or more of their many subsidiaries. Nevertheless, OSM expects that companies will
make a good faith effort to track their NOV's and report such NOV's as part of permit applications. Where a company has
developed a good faith NOV tracking procedure and, in the diligent exercise of such procedure, has inadvertently
failed to report an NOV whose abatement period has not yet expired, such failure would not constitute willful nondisclosure
by the company. On the other hand, where a company fails to set up a tracking procedure or where a company sets up a tracking
procedure or corporate structure designed or intended to shield it from knowledge of NOV's or the ability to track
NOV's this will not excuse a company's failure to accurately report NOV's in permit applications. Further, OSM expects
that any certifications of ongoing correction provided with respect to NOV's be based upon truthful information
and be submitted in good faith. To the extent that a company asserts that it cannot certify because it is not certain
whether all violations have been identified, the presumption of NOV abatement would not apply. OSM recognizes that
companies may assert this argument, but OSM considers the certification necessary to assure that violations are
in the process of being corrected.

As indicated above, the second issue in the proposed rule which generated significant comments was the proposed safe
harbor for the owners or controllers of delinquent civil penalties for violations issued prior to October 3, 1988.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters from the coal industry and the States criticized the safe harbor proposal because it required, as a condition
precedent for safe harbor treatment, that reclamation be completed within 120 days after the effective date of the
rule. These commenters asserted that this proposed condition limiting the availability of safe harbor protection
was inadequate and insufficiently flexible. They argued that the proposal did not take into account the time required
to perform reclamation and the potential for reclamation to be effected by changing events and environmental conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, commenters representing the environmental community also criticized the safe harbor provision. These
commenters criticized the proposed $750 settlement amount as arbitrarily and artificially low. Commenters representing
the State regulatory authorities asserted that the proposed penalty amount provided insufficient flexibility
and that a State regulatory authority should be able to demand a greater penalty if the circumstances warrant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the industry and the States focused upon the limited window of time available to perform abatement and the environmentalists
and the States questioned the limited penalty amount, all of these commenters seemed to share the view, subject to
their particular and differing perspectives, that the proposed safe harbor provision was artificial and unnecessarily
rigid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon consideration of the comments, OSM agrees that the proposal was unnecessarily rigid and has, therefore, not
finalized the safe harbor proposal. Accordingly, regulatory authorities will have the discretion to review the
totality of the facts on a case by case basis to determine whether a person who is linked, through ownership or control,
to delinquent civil penalties may avoid permit block through payment of a portion of such penalties. OSM will review
the adequacy of such settlements within the context of OSM's routine oversight of the State regulatory authorities
under 30 CFR parts 732 and 733 and of case specific complaints and investigations under 30 CFR part 842.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Whether a settlement is adequate will be a function of the entire context of a particular case. Factors to be considered
include, but are not limited to, whether the settling owner or controller has performed required reclamation to abate
the violations other than the delinquent civil penalties in a timely manner. The regulatory authority should also
consider the degree to which the facts indicate that the owner or controller had the authority to exercise control
of the violator. If the owner or controller had such authority, whether it chose to exercise such authority or not,
it is less credible for the owner or controller to argue that it was unaware of the activities and violations such that
a significant discount in civil penalty amount is warranted for the owner or controller. In substance, with such authority,
the owner or controller would have had the ability to be informed of violations in a timely manner if he or she had wanted
to be so informed. The regulatory authority should also consider the size and solvency of the owner or controller and
the impact that the payment of a reduced amount of the civil penalty will have upon the activities of that company and
other companies similarly situated. Further, the regulatory authority should consider the impact of the settlement
upon the integrity of the regulatory authority's enforcement program. In other words, will the proposed settlement
encourage companies to conclude that there is an economic benefit in ignoring the civil penalties and violations
of their owned or controlled entities until such companies are required to settle by regulatory authorities?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the above discussion, OSM has not adopted the provisions of the proposed rule which would have deleted
the presumption that NOV abatement currently contained in 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) and which would have created a safe
harbor for owners or controllers with respect to delinquent civil penalties for violations cited prior to October
3, 1988. In paragraph (b)(1) of the final rule, OSM has inserted language providing for a presumption of NOV abatement
for NOV's whose abatement periods have not yet expired where the permit applicants have certified that such NOV's
are in the process of being corrected to the satisfaction of the agency with jurisdiction over the violation. In the
final rule, OSM has also deleted the language contained in the proposed rule which would have provided the safe harbor
for certain owners or controllers. OSM has otherwise adopted the provisions of the proposed rule as the final rule.

Section 773.20_Improvidently Issued Permits: General Procedures. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the proposed rule, OSM proposed to amend paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of 30 CFR 773.20 to delete the reference to the presumption
of NOV abatement contained in 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). See Proposed Rule, Use of the Applicant/Violator Computer System
in Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Permit Approval, 56 FR 45780, 45784&hyph;45785 (September 6, 1991). The basis
for such deletion was to assure consistency with the provisions of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) which were to be similarly amended.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the final rule, OSM has reinserted language which addresses the situation which occurs when a permit is issued in
reliance upon the presumption that an NOV is being abated in the absence of a cessation order and a cessation order is,
in fact, issued with respect to the violation. In such an event, a regulatory authority is required to find that the
permit has been improvidently issued. The September, 1991, proposed rule deleted this language to assure consistency
with OSM's proposal to delete the presumption of NOV abatement from the permit review process of 30 CFR 773.15(b).
As described in this preamble in the discussion relating to 30 CFR 773.15(b), OSM has decided to include a presumption
of NOV abatement for that regulation. To assure consistency between the treatment of improvidently issued permits
and permit applications, OSM has reinserted language which addresses the presumption of NOV abatement into 30 CFR
773.20(b)(1)(i)(B). The agency's reasons for retaining a presumption of NOV abatement are described fully in the
preamble discussion with respect to 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the proposed rule, OSM also proposed to renumber certain provisions of the then current 30 CFR 773.20 such that paragraph
(b)(2) would become (b)(1)(ii), paragraph (b)(2)(i) would become (b)(1)(ii)(A), paragraph (b)(2)(ii) would become
(b)(1)(ii)(B), and paragraph (b)(3) would become (b)(1)(iii). In the final rule, such renumbering is also adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM also proposed to amend the then current 30 CFR 773.20 by inserting a new paragraph (b)(2), which would have made
the provisions of proposed &sect;773.26, standards for challenging ownership or control links and the status of
violations, applicable when a regulatory authority makes determinations with respect to improvidently issued
permits. Proposed &sect;773.26 would have been applicable when a regulatory authority determines whether a violation,
penalty, or fee remains unabated or delinquent, has been corrected, is in the process of being corrected, or is the
subject of a good faith appeal, and whether any ownership or control link between the permittee and the person responsible
for the violation, penalty, or fee existed, still exists, or has been severed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed insertion of the language referring to &sect;773.26 would have had the effect of assuring that the standards,
responsibilities, and procedures created by proposed &sect;773.26 were consistently applied to permit issuance
and to determinations regarding improvident permit issuance. OSM took such an approach in the belief that this would
enhance the fairness of the permitting process and the prospect for the uniform enforcement of nationwide minimum
standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the final rule, this approach is adopted. The reference to &sect;773.26 is changed, however, to &sect;773.25 to
reflect the renumbering of that section. Also, as has been indicated previously, OSM has inserted language in paragraph
(b)(2) of final &sect;773.20 to clarify that a challenge as to the existence of a violation at the time it was cited may
be made within the context of the improvident permit issuance process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM further proposed to renumber provisions of the regulation at 30 CFR 773.20(c), which relate to remedial measures
for improvidently issued permits, so that then current paragraph (c) would become (c)(1), then current paragraph
(c)(1) would become (c)(1)(i), then current paragraph (c)(2) would become (c)(1)(ii), then current paragraph (c)(3)
would become (c)(1)(iii), and then current paragraph (c)(4) would become (c)(1)(iv). In the final rule, such renumbering
is adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, proposed renumbered paragraph (c)(1)(iv), which would authorize the regulatory authority to use rescission
as one of the remedial measures for improvident permit issuance, would have deleted a specific reference contained
in the former 30 CFR 773.20(c)(4) to the rescission procedures of 30 CFR 773.21.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reason for such proposed deletion was that OSM sought to establish a prior notice and common appeal procedure for
both permit suspensions and permit rescissions with respect to improvidently issued permits. The then current regulation
governing permit suspensions at 30 CFR 773.20(c)(3) did not impose any specific requirements for prior notice, opportunity
to be heard, or right of appeal for the permittee whose permit is to be suspended. See 54 FR 18450 (1989). In contrast
to this, then current regulations governing permit rescissions at 30 CFR 773.21 contained specific requirements
for prior notice to a permittee and an explicit right of appeal. Accordingly, through its proposed rule, OSM sought
to provide for greater consistency in its procedures governing suspension and rescission of permits. In the final
rule, the proposed change has been adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM further proposed to amend 30 CFR 773.20 to add a new paragraph (c)(2) which would have required that a regulatory
authority which decides to suspend a permit must provide at least 30 days' prior written notice to the permittee. The
proposed rule would have provided that, in the event that the regulatory authority decides to rescind a permit, it
would provide notice in accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 773.21. The proposed amendment further provided
that a permittee would be given the opportunity to request administrative review of the notice under proposed OHA
rules 43 CFR 4.1370 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, where OSM is the regulatory authority, or under the State program equivalent, where the State is the regulatory authority.
In the absence of such temporary relief, the regulatory authority's decision would have remained in effect during
the pendency of appeal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM's proposed rule amendments made no change in the requirement contained at 30 CFR 773.20(b) that a regulatory authority
analyze a potentially improvidently issued permit ``[U]nder the violations review criteria of the regulatory program
at the time that the permit was issued.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A commenter representing one of the State regulatory authorities criticized the provisions of the proposed rule
which would have required that the regulatory authority provide thirty days' written notice to the permittee, if
the regulatory authority decides to suspend the permit. This commenter asserted that there may be circumstances
which require the immediate suspension and, possibly, outright rescission of a permit. This commenter asserted
that delay, in the interests of due process rights, may not serve the public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM appreciates the commenter's concerns. It is entirely conceivable that a permittee could have been issued a permit
even though the permittee was linked, through ownership or control, to a string of unabated violations at the time
of permit issuance. The permittee could have willfully and fraudulently concealed such links through some clever
scheme or artifice at the time of permit application. While AVS has reduced the potential for such a scenario to occur,
it remains possible. Such a permit ought to be subject to immediate suspension.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nevertheless, OSM must weigh the public interest in preventing violators from keeping permits against the public
interest in assuring that permittees' due process rights are protected. The remedies of permit suspension and rescission
are serious. Unlike an applicant who merely has an expectancy in his application to receive a permit to mine, a permittee
has, in fact and as a matter of law, assumed the rights and responsibilities incident to the permit to engage in surface
coal mining operations. Indeed, OSM's regulations provide that a valid permit carries with it the right of successive
renewal. See 30 CFR 774.15(a). Thus, a permittee has an interest which is deserving of a higher level of protection
than the interest of an applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the provisions of 30 CFR 773.21 previously provided for notice to the permittee only prior to a proposed permit
suspension and rescission. Thus, a permittee got prior notice of a suspension only if the suspension was the precursor
to a subsequent rescission. If the regulatory authority did not intend the suspension of a permit to be followed by
the permit's rescission, there was no requirement for prior notice. Also, the provisions of 30 CFR 773.21 provided
appeal rights for a notice of suspension and rescission. There were no similar appeal rights in 30 CFR 773.20 with respect
to suspension. In substance, permit suspension had the potential of being a harsher punishment than permit rescission
by reason of these procedural differences. These were anomalies that OSM wanted to correct.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the final version of 30 CFR 773.20(c)(2) provides for notice prior to permit suspension; for administrative
review of the notice of suspension under 43 CFR 4.1370 et seq. or under the State program equivalent; for a common appeal
procedure for both permit suspensions and permit rescissions with respect to improvidently issued permits and for
the regulatory authority's decision to remain in effect during the pendency of an appeal, unless temporary relief
has been granted in accordance with 43 CFR 4.1376 or the State program equivalent. States can be more stringent with
respect to providing less prior notice, but they are responsible for the legal consequences of such actions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industry commenters objected to OSM's assertion of any role in revoking or setting aside improvidently issued permits
based upon the totality of their objections to the AVS, the ownership and control rules, and the proposed rules. These
reasons included the proposed rules' alleged deficiencies with respect to due process, State primacy, dispersion
of authority for permit decisionmaking, and all other objections asserted by industry commenters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM disagrees with the commenters' views, including their view that OSM has no legitimate role in the improvidently
issued permit process. OSM has an essential role to play, both as a regulatory authority and as an agency of the Federal
government overseeing the States' programs. OSM incorporates by reference its previous responses to industry commenters
in this preamble which address the commenters' concerns. Further, in the preamble to the rules governing improvidently
issued permits, OSM has explained the legal basis for the improvidently issued permit rules and the rationale for
OSM's role with respect to the implementation of such rules in relation to the States. See Preamble to 30 CFR 773.20,

Environmentalist commenters criticized the portions of 30 CFR 773.20 which provide that the test for evaluating
whether a permit was improvidently issued is ``the violations review criteria of the regulatory program at the time
the permit was issued.'' See 30 CFR 773.20(b). These commenters asserted that OSM should clearly spell out the violations
review criteria, rather than rely upon the individual regulatory programs' criteria at the time of permit issuance
as the applicable standards. These commenters criticized the provisions of OSM's regulations as being contrary
to the Act and cited in support portions of their brief filed in the case of

OSM disagrees with the commenters' position. As indicated above, OSM's proposed rule did not propose substantive
changes to this provision of the regulation. In the preamble to the improvidently issued permit rules cited above,
OSM explained its rationale for using the violations review criteria of the regulatory program at the time the permit
was issued as the standard for improvident issuance. See Preamble to 30 CFR 773.20, 773.21, and 843.21; Final Rule,

, No. 81&hyph;2134 (D.D.C.), environmental advocates advanced similar arguments with respect to the agency's improvidently
issued permit rules and the provisions of the rules applying the violations review criteria of the regulatory program
at the time of permit issuance. In the briefs submitted by the Department of the Interior in those cases, the Department
analyzed relevant statutory language and legislative history and carefully explained why the environmental advocates'
criticisms were not well taken. Copies of these briefs are being placed in the Administrative Record of this rulemaking.
OSM incorporates the arguments advanced by the Department in those briefs herein by reference.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environmental commenters also criticized other portions of 30 CFR 773.20 for which OSM did not propose any substantive
amendments as part of the September, 1991, proposed rules. The commenters asserted that OSM should clarify that the
remedial measures available to a regulatory authority to cure an improvidently issued permit require that the regulatory
authority impose both an abatement plan and a permit condition incorporating such plan before an improvidently issued
permit is considered resolved. They asserted that the provisions of 30 CFR 773.20(c) inappropriately allow the regulatory
authority to choose whether to require a permit condition or an abatement plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM disagrees with the commenters that a rule amendment is needed. The provisions of the regulation require that the
regulatory authority ``use one or more'' of the listed remedial measures including requiring the implementation
of an abatement agreement; conditioning the permit upon abatement of outstanding violations within a reasonable
period of time; suspension of the permit; or rescission of the permit. This provision affords the regulatory authority
the opportunity to exercise discretion, in light of the circumstances, to make a reasoned choice as to the appropriate
remedy. In the preamble to the improvidently issued permit rule, OSM stated, in relevant part, as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This section *&blank;*&blank;* includes four alternative remedial measures because of the diversity of circumstances
under which a regulatory authority might find that a permit was improvidently issued, and the resulting need to apply
a remedy that not only is administratively appropriate, but also is fair and equitable to the permittee *&blank;*&blank;*.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSMRE believes that the term [``improvidently issued''] reflects the severity of the problem involved when a regulatory
authority should not have issued a permit, while at the same time not foreclosing reasonable flexibility in the adoption
of appropriate remedial measures *&blank;*&blank;*.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[T]he rule affords the regulatory authority reasonable discretion to consider the circumstances involving a particular
improvidently issued permit and to fashion an appropriate remedy *&blank;*&blank;*.

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the rule does not require a regulatory authority to use any particular one of the four remedial measures,
OSMRE intends that the measure or measures used will be commensurate with the circumstances under which a permit was
improvidently issued.

 54 FR 18438, 18447&hyph;18448 (April 28, 1989). Certainly, it could be reasonable, depending upon particular circumstances,
for a regulatory authority to require both a plan of abatement and a permit condition implementing such plan. The agency
has previously rejected the view, however, that there is only one correct option or options from the alternative remedies
provided in the improvidently issued permit rule which is or are appropriate for all circumstances. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Id. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The provisions of the regulation afford the regulatory authority the opportunity to tailor a remedy ``package''
appropriate for the particular circumstances under which a permit was improvidently issued. The goals of any such
remedy are ``to correct the defect in the permit and achieve a state of compliance.''

at 18447. If either a permit condition or an abatement agreement could reasonably be expected to accomplish these
goals under the circumstances, then either would be sufficient to resolve the improvidently issued permit. In the
event that it becomes apparent that selected remedial measures are not effective, each of the remedies affords leverage
to the regulatory authority to compel compliance. Such choices are appropriately made by the regulatory authority,
subject to OSM's oversight under 30 CFR 843.21. At this time, OSM sees no reason to amend the regulation to routinely
require the use of both remedies in all circumstances where abatement of a violation is to be undertaken as a necessary
part of the resolution of an improvidently issued permit.

Section 773.21_Improvidently issued permits: Rescission procedures. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the proposed rule, OSM proposed to amend the then current regulation at 30 CFR 773.21(a) to make the provisions of
proposed &sect;773.26, standards for challenging ownership or control links and the status of violations, applicable
when a regulatory authority invokes the automatic suspension and rescission procedures of 30 CFR 773.21. The rationale
for such amendment is the same as that discussed above with respect to similar language contained in &sect;773.20.
In substance, that was to assure that the standards, responsibilities, and procedures created by proposed &sect;773.26
were consistently applied to permit issuance and to determinations regarding improvident permit issuance. OSM
proposed such an approach in the belief that this would enhance the fairness of the permitting process and the prospect
for the uniform enforcement of nationwide minimum standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, OSM proposed to delete paragraph (c) of then current 30 CFR 773.21 which provided for appeals of rescission
notices. Under the proposal, rescission appeal procedures were to be incorporated in 30 CFR 773.20.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter representing a State regulatory authority asserted that the States typically have provisions for
the administrative review of a regulatory authority's decision to suspend or rescind a permit. Accordingly, this
commenter questioned why OSM's proposed rules needed to include provisions for the appeals of permit rescissions
due to improvidently issued permits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rationale for providing appeal procedures for permit rescissions incident to improvidently issued permits
is essentially the same as the rationale for providing appeal procedures for permit suspensions. In substance, a
permittee has, in fact and as a matter of law, assumed the rights and responsibilities incident to the permit to engage
in surface coal mining operations. Indeed, OSM's regulation provides that a valid permit carries with it the right
of successive renewal. See 30 CFR 774.15(a). Thus, a permittee has an interest which is deserving of protection. Thus,
a permittee whose permit has been rescinded is entitled to a review of the decision to rescind.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to the proposed amendment of September, 1991, then current 30 CFR 773.21 provided notice and appeal rights with
respect to permit rescission incident to improvidently issued permits. By proposing to amend this rule to achieve
a common set of procedural protections for permit suspensions and permit rescissions incident to improvidently
issued permits, it was not OSM's intention to reduce the appellate rights previously provided by 30 CFR 773.21 or comparable
State provisions. Instead, OSM wanted to assure that procedures of review were available for both permit suspensions
and permit rescissions. The absence of such procedures for suspensions was a matter which OSM sought to address.

To the extent that State programs already have adequate appeals and notice procedures with respect to permit rescissions
incident to improvidently issued permits, OSM believes that the proposed rules should impose little, if any, additional
burden upon such States. Under the Act, OSM's responsibility is to establish minimum national standards which approved
State programs are required to meet. Accordingly, individual State programs may exceed OSM's standards. A State
which has such provisions may respond to any 732 letters OSM sends as a result of this rule by affirming that the State
already interprets its program consistent with this Federal provision.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the above reasons, the commenter's position is rejected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM has decided to adopt the proposed changes as part of the final rules. In adopting the proposal, OSM has modified
the provisions at paragraph (a) of 30 CFR 773.21 to make the provisions of &sect;773.25, standards for challenging
ownership or control links and the status of violation, applicable when a regulatory authority invokes the automatic
suspension and rescission procedures of 30 CFR 773.21. The proposed rule contained a reference to &sect;773.26.
This change reflects that proposed &sect;773.26 has been renumbered as final &sect;773.25. OSM has made an additional
non-substantive change to the introductory paragraph of &sect;773.21 to reflect that &sect;773.20(c)(4) has been
renumbered to be &sect;773.20(c)(1)(iv). Further, OSM deletes former paragraph (c) of 30 CFR 773.21 which provides
for appeals of rescission notices. As discussed above, rescission appeal procedures are incorporated in 30 CFR 773.20.

Section 773.22_Verification of ownership or control application information.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 OSM proposed &sect;773.22 to mandate an inquiry whose focus was to assure that the regulatory authority develops
complete and accurate information as to the identification of the applicant and all owners or controllers of the applicant
prior to making a determination on a permit application. Accordingly, the proposed section focused on verification
of ownership or control application information. Such accurate and complete information would enable the regulatory
authority to make an informed decision as to whether the applicant was linked to a surface coal mining and reclamation
operation in violation of the Act or of any other environmental laws within the terms of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a) of proposed &sect;773.22 would have imposed a duty upon a regulatory authority to review the information
provided in the permit application, pursuant to 30 CFR 778.13(c) and 778.13(d), to determine whether the information
provided, including the identification of the operator and all owners and controllers of the operator, was complete
and accurate. In making such determination, the regulatory authority would have been required to compare information
provided in the application with information contained in manual and automated data sources. Manual sources for
review would have included the regulatory authority's own enforcement and inspection records and State corporation
commission or tax records, to the extent they contain information concerning ownership or control links. Automated
data sources would have included the regulatory authority's own computer systems, if any, and the AVS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) of proposed &sect;773.22 would have provided that, if it appeared from information provided in the
application pursuant to paragraphs (c) and (d) of &sect;778.13 that none of the persons identified in the application
had had any previous mining experience, the regulatory authority would have been required to inquire of the applicant
whether anyone other than those persons identified in the application would own or control the mining operation as
either an operator or as another type of owner or controller.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule assumed that, given the complexity of modern coal mining operations, it was likely that most applicants
would have at least someone in an ownership or control capacity who had had previous mining experience. If it appeared
from the face of an application that that was not the case, the regulatory authority would have been required to contact
the applicant to verify that the applicant had not omitted from the application an operator or other owner or controller
who had such experience. The intent of this proposal was to ensure that the regulatory authority obtains information
on other, experienced persons who may actually be running the operation and should therefore have been disclosed
as part of the ownership and control data in a permit application, but were not.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) of proposed &sect;773.22 provided that if, after conducting the information review described above,
the regulatory authority identified any potential omission, inaccuracy, or inconsistency in the ownership or control
information provided in the application, it would be required to contact the applicant prior to making a final determination
with respect to the application. The applicant would then be required to resolve the potential omission, inaccuracy,
or inconsistency through submission of an amendment to the application or a satisfactory explanation which includes
credible information sufficient to demonstrate that no actual omission, inaccuracy, or inconsistency existed.
The regulatory authority was also required to take action in accordance with the provisions of proposed &sect;843.23,
sanctions for knowing omissions or inaccuracies in ownership or control and violation information, or the State
program equivalent, where appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d) of proposed &sect;773.22 would have required that, upon completion of the information review mandated
by &sect;773.22, the regulatory authority promptly enter all ownership or control information into AVS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industry commenters objected to the provision of the proposed rule requiring that the regulatory authority compare
information provided in the permit application with sources such as State corporation commission or tax records.
They asserted that such records are typically updated only on an annual basis and may be obviously inaccurate. They
further asserted that requiring the applicant to explain discrepancies between information contained in the application
and the State corporation commission or tax records will lead to inappropriate delays in the permit process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM disagrees with the commenters' criticisms of the proposed requirement. The proposed requirement was designed
to assure that the regulatory authority reviewing an application has complete ownership and control information.
Such information is necessary to enable the regulatory authority to determine whether the application should be
issued in accordance with the provisions of section 510(c) of the Act and 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Unfortunately, a regulatory authority cannot simply rely upon all applicants to supply complete ownership or control
information. Some applicants may err in good faith, others may conceal information knowingly. Accordingly, the
regulatory authority must look to other sources of information. The information contained in the records of State
corporation commissions or taxing authorities is a good potential source of ownership or control information. Depending
upon particular State requirements, such information may have been submitted under oath. Further, such information
is submitted subject to the review of State corporation commissions and State taxing authorities. Thus, a State regulatory
authority reviewing such information has the benefit of any efforts made by these other agencies to assure that information
submitted to them is accurate and complete.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, such information is important because it provides a basis for inquiry and for comparison with information
submitted in the permit application. If there are discrepancies between the ownership or control information in
such records and that submitted in the permit application, the applicant should be able to readily explain such discrepancies.
Thus, if any information previously submitted to State taxing authorities or corporation commission has become
subsequently outdated, this can be explained with minimal inconvenience to an applicant and minimal delay in the
permit application process. On the other hand, if important ownership or control information has been omitted from
a permit application, the State taxing and corporation commission records may be the key to identifying such omissions.
In any event, the benefits of such information to the regulatory authority outweigh the risks identified by the industry
commenters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter representing State regulatory authorities also asserted that these records rarely provide information
not contained in previous permit applications or in AVS. This commenter also indicated that these records are difficult
to obtain because tax records are not typically available for review by State agencies other than the taxing authorities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM disagrees with the view that these types of records merely contain information which is duplicative of information
already available to the State regulatory authorities through permit applications or AVS. While OSM makes every
effort to assure that AVS contains complete and accurate information with respect to ownership or control links,
OSM has never asserted that AVS is perfect. Even if AVS were a perfectly complete source of such information, new corporations
are being formed and new applications to conduct surface coal mining operations are submitted. AVS must be regularly
updated. It is likely that there is relevant ownership or control information contained in corporation commission
and tax records of the various States which is not yet reflected on AVS. Thus, there is a need for State regulatory authorities
to review such information and compare such information with permit applications to identify accurate and complete
ownership or control information. Such information can then be added to the AVS database.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to commenter's concern about the availability of State tax and corporation commission records, OSM
recognizes that particular State laws may limit a State regulatory authority's access to such records. The requirement
of the proposed regulation was for the regulatory authority to review ``reasonably available sources.'' Thus, if
a State law explicitly forbids the regulatory authority's access to State tax information, the information would
not be ``reasonably available'' for review. In the absence of such explicit prohibition, however, State regulatory
authorities should review such information. OSM encourages State regulatory authorities to work with their sister
tax and corporation commission agencies to develop information access arrangements to the extent permissible under
applicable laws. Nevertheless, OSM rejects the view that the difficulty of obtaining the information justifies
withdrawing or amending the proposing regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter representing State regulatory authorities further questioned the requirement contained in paragraph
(c)(2) of proposed &sect;773.22 that ``credible information,'' rather that ``credible evidence,'' support an
applicant's satisfactory explanation of omissions, inaccuracies, or inconsistencies with respect to ownership
or control information in an application. OSM used the term ``credible information,'' rather than ``credible evidence''
because this is a broader concept than credible evidence. This term would include credible evidence which would be
admissible at trial. Nevertheless, an applicant might be able to provide a satisfactory explanation based upon information
which would not necessarily be admissible at trial, but which is a reliable and believable basis to conclude that no
actual omission, inaccuracy, or inconsistency exists. Accordingly, the language of the proposed regulation was
intended to provide flexibility to the regulatory authority to consider such information, including credible evidence.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM has determined to adopt the proposed rule at &sect;773.22 as a final rule with minor modifications which are now
described.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated above, paragraph (b) of the proposed rule would have required that, if it appeared from information provided
in the application pursuant to paragraphs (c) and (d) of &sect;778.13, that none of the persons identified in the application
had any previous mining experience, the regulatory authority had to inquire of the applicant whether anyone other
than those persons identified in the application would own or control the mining operation as either an operator or
as another type of owner or controller. The final rule imposes the duty upon the regulatory authority to both inquire
of the applicant and to investigate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the proposed rule, there may have been an implication that the regulatory authority could simply conclude its inquiry
in reliance upon the applicant's explanation. Such an implication was not intended. Accordingly, OSM has added explicit
language to paragraph (b) of final &sect;773.22 to insure that, if none of the persons identified in the permit application
has had any previous mining experience, the regulatory authority will not simply rely upon the applicant's explanations.
Instead, the regulatory authority will go forward to investigate whether any persons other than those identified
in the application will conduct the mining.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the final version of &sect;773.22, OSM has retained language from paragraph (c) of the proposed &sect;773.22 requiring
the regulatory authority to take action in accordance with the provisions of &sect;843.23 or the State program equivalent.
However, OSM has deferred action on the adoption of proposed &sect;843.23 for a later rulemaking. See 58 FR 34652 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(June 28, 1993). The reference to that rule has been left in final &sect;773.22 in the event that a final version of &sect;843.23
is adopted. The inclusion of such reference, however, does not prejudge whether OSM will ultimately adopt such a rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated above, paragraph (d) of the proposed rule would have required that, upon completion of the information
review mandated by &sect;773.22, the regulatory authority promptly enter all ownership or control information
into AVS. OSM has adopted the final version of this paragraph to require that, upon completion of its review, the regulatory
authority enter ownership or control information ``into'' AVS. If such information is already on the system, the
regulatory authority is required to ``update'' such information. Such changes have been made to provide better clarity
to the rule language.

Section 773.23_Review of Ownership or Control and Violation Information. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM proposed &sect;773.23 as a new section which would delineate the regulatory authority's review obligations
with respect to a permit application after the regulatory authority had completed the process of verifying ownership
or control application information as described in &sect;773.22.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions of paragraph (a) of proposed &sect;773.23 would have required the regulatory authority to review
all reasonably available information concerning violation notices and ownership or control links involving the
applicant to determine whether the application could be approved under the provisions of 30 CFR 773.15(b). With respect
to ownership or control links involving the applicant, such information would have included all information obtained
under 30 CFR 773.22 and 778.13. With respect to violation notices, such information would have included all information
obtained under &sect;778.14, information obtained from OSM, including information shown in the AVS, and information
obtained from the regulatory authority's own records concerning violation notices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In substance, the proposed regulation was designed to assure that the regulatory authority considers complete ownership,
control, and violation information in making the decision required by 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) with respect to a permit
application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions of paragraph (b) of proposed &sect;773.23 were proposed to provide the course of action which a regulatory
authority would be required to take if the review conducted pursuant to paragraph (a) of the section disclosed any
ownership or control link between the applicant and any person cited in a violation notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, paragraph (b)(1) of proposed &sect;773.23 would have required that the regulatory authority notify the applicant
of such link and refer the applicant to the agency with jurisdiction over the violation notice.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (b)(2) of proposed &sect;773.23 would have required that the regulatory authority not approve the permit
application unless and until it determined that all ownership or control links between the applicant and any person
cited in a violation notice were erroneous or had been rebutted, or the regulatory authority determined that the violation
to which the applicant had been linked had been corrected, was in the process of being corrected, or was the subject
of a good faith appeal, within the meaning of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) or the State program equivalent. The determinations
to be made by the regulatory authority under paragraph (b)(2) of the proposed regulation were to have been made in accordance
with the provisions of proposed &sect;773.24, procedures for challenging ownership or control links shown in AVS,
and proposed &sect;773.26, standards for challenging ownership or control links and the status of violations, or
their State program equivalents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) of proposed &sect;773.23 would have required that, following the regulatory authority's decision
on the application or following the applicant's withdrawal of the application, the regulatory authority be required
to promptly enter all relevant information related to the decision or withdrawal into AVS. The regulatory authority's
decision could have included unconditional issuance, conditional issuance, or denial of the permit. The requirement
that all relevant information be promptly entered into AVS was intended to insure that AVS was continually updated
to reflect the most current information available with respect to permit applicants. A critical source of such information
would be the regulatory authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters representing members of the coal industry criticized the provisions of the proposed regulation as being
unnecessarily duplicative of the provisions of proposed &sect;773.22 and of 30 CFR 773.15(b). In support of this
position, they pointed to the provisions of the proposed regulation which require the review of violation information
and ownership or control links to determine whether an application could be approved. They questioned why the requirements
of proposed &sect;&sect;773.22 and 773.23 would be imposed as two separate stages, rather than as a single stage of
the permit application process under 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM disagrees with the view that the provisions of proposed &sect;&sect;773.22 and 773.23 are duplicative or redundant
to each other or with respect to the provisions of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). Further, OSM does not believe that these provisions
should be consolidated with the provisions of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While each of the regulatory sections at issue are part of the permit application and review process, the two proposed
&sect;&sect;773.22 and 773.23 represent separate tasks for the regulatory authority. In implementing the provisions
of proposed &sect;773.22, the regulatory authority would be focusing upon information contained in the permit application
and attempting to verify such information by comparing it with other readily available sources of information. The
purpose of such activity is to identify complete and accurate information with respect to the application, including
identification of the person or persons who will own or control the surface coal mining operation. In implementing
the provisions of proposed &sect; 773.23, the regulatory authority takes the information gleaned from its research
on the application and then evaluates whether there are any ownership or control links between the applicant and any
person cited in a violation notice. In this stage, the focus of inquiry is to determine whether the permit can be approved
in accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 773.15(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While both of these stages involve the use of AVS, this does not mean that such stages are redundant or duplicative.
The AVS should be consulted throughout the permit application process to assure that the regulatory authority has
the most current ownership or control and violation information available from OSM and other State regulatory authorities.
The AVS is an evolving information system which is routinely supplemented with new information. The use of AVS in the
earlier stage, proposed &sect;773.22, provides an information resource for comparison with application ownership
or control information and a basis for inquiry with the applicant. During the later stage, proposed &sect;773.23,
the regulatory authority takes previously developed ownership or control information and compares such information
with outstanding violation information in deciding whether or not to issue the permit. The use of AVS in this stage
enables the regulatory authority to have the benefit of any information which may have been subsequently added to
AVS by OSM or other State regulatory authorities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Further, neither of the provisions of proposed sections are redundant with 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). The provisions of
30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) do not delineate the means by which a regulatory authority may comply with the mandates of section
510(c) of the Act or 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). Proposed &sect;&sect;773.22 and 773.23 fill this need. These proposed sections
provide the specific steps to be taken by a regulatory authority to achieve compliance with the provisions of 30 CFR
773.15(b)(1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One industry commenter suggested that all of these provisions should be consolidated into a single violations review
provision. While this is a reasonable alternative, OSM is convinced that the approach contained in the proposed rules
is a better alternative. The placement of the required tasks in separate sections of the regulations, with appropriate
cross references, better highlights the particular duties necessary at each stage of the permit application review
process in a way which is more likely to support compliance. Also, as the above discussion demonstrates, the tasks
are sufficiently separable that they lend themselves to separate regulatory sections. Such separation, however,
does not mean that there must be unnecessary delays. A regulatory authority can move forward methodically through
each required task in a timely manner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter representing State regulatory authorities criticized the provisions of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of proposed
&sect;773.23 because such provision would prohibit the issuance of a permit if there are outstanding violations.
He asserted that these provisions would significantly increase the burden on applicants, because the provisions
did not incorporate the presumption that an NOV is considered abated unless an FTACO has been issued.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this preamble, OSM has already addressed the matter of the presumption of NOV abatement within the discussion of
the amendments to 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) which have been adopted today. As indicated, OSM has determined to retain a presumption
of NOV abatement where the abatement period for the NOV has not expired and the applicant has provided certification
that the violation is in the process of being corrected to the satisfaction of the agency with jurisdiction over the
violation. Since the provisions of proposed &sect;773.23 incorporate the provisions of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1), such
presumption would be similarly applied as part of proposed &sect;773.23. Thus, the substance of commenter's concern
has been addressed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters representing environmental advocacy groups urged that paragraph (a) of proposed &sect;773.23 be clarified
with respect to the regulatory authority's duty to review the accuracy of ownership or control information. They
pointed out that there are many additional sources of ownership or control information beyond those listed in the
regulation which a regulatory authority could review. They asserted that the regulatory authority should be required
to review the sources listed in the regulation, the AVS and the regulatory authority's own records, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
at a minimum.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM agrees that there are many potential sources of ownership or control information and that the sources for review
listed in the proposed regulation are those which the regulatory authority should be required to review, at a minimum.
OSM disagrees, however, that the proposed regulation needs to be further clarified or modified. There is already
language in the proposed regulation which meets the substance of commenters' concerns. In paragraph (a) of proposed
&sect;773.23, the regulatory authority is required to ``review all reasonably available information 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
concerning violation notices and ownership or control links involving the applicant *&blank;*&blank;*.'' (Emphasis
added.) In addition, the language makes clear that ``[s]uch information shall include'' the listed items which follow
in
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->

<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->

<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
 paragraphs (a)(1&hyph;2) of the proposed regulation. The clear meaning of this proposed language is that the listed
examples are those sources which the regulatory authority must review. In addition, the regulatory authority can
choose to review other sources.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters representing environmental advocacy groups also urged OSM to incorporate standards to demonstrate
whether an outstanding violation has been corrected or is in the process of being corrected to the satisfaction of
the agency with jurisdiction over such violation. OSM believes that the regulatory authority which issued the violation
can effectively define the status of such violation with additional standards. This regulatory authority is well
positioned to determine whether the violation which it has issued has been abated or is in the process of being abated
to its satisfaction. A regulatory authority before which a permit application is pending should consult the regulatory
authority which issued the violation to ascertain the status of any violation to which an applicant has been linked
through ownership or control.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM has determined to adopt the proposed rule as a final rule with a small modification which is now described. In adopting
the proposal, OSM has modified the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of section 773.23 to make the provisions of &sect;&sect;773.25,
standards for challenging ownership or control links and the status of violations, along with those contained in
&sect;773.24, applicable when a regulatory authority makes a determination whether to approve a permit. The proposed
rule contained a reference to proposed section 773.26. This change reflects that proposed section 773.26 has been
renumbered as final &sect;773.25. The rule is otherwise adopted as proposed.

Section 773.24_Procedures for Challenging Ownership or Control Links Shown in AVS.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 OSM proposed &sect;773.24 to establish the procedures to be followed in the event that the AVS showed an ownership
or control link between a person and any person cited in a violation notice. The proposed section would have provided
procedures for direct appeals of such links to OSM by persons who had been so linked. The proposed section would also
have provided for challenges concerning the status of violations to which persons shown on AVS had been linked. The
proposed section would have further provided the opportunity for those persons making a challenge to have obtained
temporary relief from any adverse use of the challenged link or violation information during the pendency of such
challenge.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a)(1) of proposed &sect;773.24 would have provided that an applicant or anyone else shown in AVS in an ownership
or control link to any person cited in a Federal or State violation could have challenged such a link in accordance with
the provisions of paragraphs (b) through (d) of proposed &sect;773.24 and in accordance with the provisions of proposed
&sect;773.26, standards for challenging ownership or control links and the status of violations. Paragraph (a)(1)
of proposed &sect;773.24 would have provided, however, that such challenge would not be available if the challenger
was bound by a prior administrative or judicial decision with respect to the link.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In substance, paragraph (a)(1) of proposed &sect;773.24 would have provided that challenges of ownership or control
links shown on AVS be made before OSM. The theory of the proposed regulation was that, once information with respect
to particular ownership or control links has become part of the AVS and accessible to regulatory authorities across
the country, the responsibility for the maintenance of such information would be a Federal responsibility. Accordingly,
the process for challenging such information would be a Federal process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a)(2) of proposed &sect;773.24 would have provided that an applicant or anyone else shown in AVS in an ownership
or control link to a person cited in a Federal violation notice would have challenged the status of such violation in
accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (b) through (d) of proposed &sect;773.24 and in accordance with the
provisions of proposed &sect;773.26, standards for challenging ownership or control links and the status of violations.
The procedures applicable would have been similar to those described in paragraph (a)(1) of proposed &sect;773.24.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a)(2) of proposed &sect;773.24 would have provided, in language similar to that contained in paragraph
(a)(1) of the proposed regulation, that the opportunity to challenge the status of a violation would not be available
to any person who was bound by a prior administrative or judicial determination concerning the status of the violation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``status of the violation'' would have meant whether the violation remained outstanding, had been corrected,
was in the process of being corrected, or was the subject of a good faith, direct administrative or judicial appeal
to contest the validity of the violation. See 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1)(i)-(ii). This usage was to have been carried forward
into the provisions of proposed &sect;773.26, standards for challenging ownership or control links and the status
of violations. Further, the provisions of proposed &sect;773.26 would have limited challenges make to the status
of violations under proposed &sect;773.24 to prevent challenges of the existence of the violation at the time that
it was cited. Again, the process for challenging the status of a Federal violation was to have been a Federal process.
Challenges would have been made before OSM.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (a)(3) of proposed &sect;773.24 would have provided that any applicant or person shown in AVS to have been
linked by ownership or control to a person cited in a State violation notice could challenge the status of such violation
before the State that issued the violation notice. Such challenge would have to have been made in accordance with that
State's program equivalents to paragraphs (b) through (d) of proposed &sect;773.24 and proposed &sect;773.26.
Again, the provisions of proposed section 773.26 would have been incorporated under proposed &sect;773.24 to prevent
challenges as to the existence of the violation at the time that it was cited.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a)(3) of proposed &sect;773.24 would have provided, in language similar to that contained in paragraph
(a)(2) of the proposed regulation, that the opportunity to challenge the status of a violation before a State program
would not be available to any person who was bound by a prior administrative or judicial determination concerning
the status of the violation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) of proposed &sect;773.24 would have required that a person seeking to challenge ownership or control
links shown in AVS or the status of Federal violations submit to OSM a written explanation of the basis for his or her
challenge and provide relevant evidentiary materials and supporting documents. The proposed regulation would
have required that such information be submitted to the Chief of OSM's AVS Office in Washington, DC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) of proposed &sect;773.24 would have required that OSM make a written determination with respect to
the ownership or control link and/or with respect to the status of the violation. The proposal required that, if an
ownership or control link had been challenged, OSM would then determine whether the link had been shown to be erroneous
or had been rebutted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(1) of proposed &sect;773.24 would have provided that, if OSM had determined that the ownership or control
link had been shown to be erroneous or had been rebutted and/or that the violation covered by the violation notice had
been corrected, appropriately appealed, or otherwise resolved within the terms of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) (i)&hyph;(ii),
OSM would be required to have provided notice of its determination to the permit applicant or other person challenging
the link or the status of the violation. Under the proposed regulation, if an application was pending, OSM would also
have to notify the regulatory authority before which the application was pending. Further, OSM would have been required
to correct information contained in AVS to reflect the determination which had been made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(2) of proposed &sect;773.24 would have provided that, if OSM had determined that the challenged ownership
or control link had not been shown to be erroneous and had not been rebutted, and that the violation remained outstanding,
OSM would have been required to provide notice of its determination to the permit applicant or other person challenging
the link or the status of the violation. Under the proposed regulation, if an application was pending, OSM would have
also been required to notify the regulatory authority before whom the application was pending. Further, OSM would
have been required to update information contained in AVS, if necessary, to reflect OSM's determinations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(2)(i) of proposed &sect;773.24 would have provided that OSM be required to serve a copy of its decision
with respect to a challenge upon the applicant or other challenger by U.S. certified mail or by any other means consistent
with the rules governing service of a summons and complaint under Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of proposed &sect;773.24 would have provided that the applicant or other challenger could
have appealed OSM's decision to the Department of the Interior's Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) within 30 days
of such decision in accordance with proposed OHA regulations at 43 CFR 4.1380 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

was granted in accordance with OHA regulations at 43 CFR 4.1386.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of proposed &sect;773.24 would have further provided for temporary relief from OSM's decision,
if OHA granted such relief in accordance with proposed OHA regulations at 43 CFR 4.1386. Under the proposed regulation,
OSM's decision would have remained in effect during the pendency of appeal, unless temporary relief was granted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters representing the coal industry took exception to the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of the proposed section
which would preclude an applicant or other person from challenging the status of a violation if he or she was ``bound
by a prior administrative or judicial determination concerning'' the status of the violation. The commenters asserted
that determining whether a person was ``bound'' by a prior determination was vague and susceptible to conflicting
interpretations. They further asserted that if, by this proposed language, OSM intended to apply the doctrines of
res judicata or collateral estoppel, there was no need to include such language in the proposed regulation, since
these doctrines would be available as legal defenses to OSM in any event. The commenters indicated that their objection
to this language also applied to the other portions of the proposed regulations where similar language imposing such
a limit on challenges was incorporated.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM disagrees with the commenters' characterization of the rule language. The proposed rule language is clear in
standing for the principle that a person is entitled to his or her challenge opportunity before an administrative
or judicial tribunal. Nevertheless, a person is not entitled to the multiple relitigation of issues which he or she
has already litigated to conclusion. Accordingly, the proposed rule is explicit in requiring that a person who is
bound by a prior administrative or judicial determination with respect to the status of a violation may not relitigate
such issue. In determining whether a person is bound by a prior determination, traditional principles of res judicata
and collateral estoppel will apply. Contrary to commenters' view, however, it is insufficient to assume that such
principles will apply as a matter of law and that there is no need to provide an explicit limitation in the regulation.
Such a limitation is necessary to eliminate any ambiguity in the regulation with respect to this issue and to assure
that judicial and administrative tribunals are not clogged with duplicative, repetitive claims by persons who have
already litigated such claims. The limiting language provides a clear statement of OSM's intent and will be adopted
as part of the final rule. Commenters representing environmental advocacy groups indicated approval of the provisions
of the proposed regulation which would have limited challenges of the existence of the violation at the time it was
cited. Such commenters did indicate concern, however, that the proposed regulation did not provide an explicit time
limit for OSM to make its decision with respect to a challenge. They urged that the regulation incorporate an explicit
time limit of 30 days for OSM to make a decision to avoid undue delay with respect to the permit application process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM disagrees with the view that the regulation needs to contain an explicit time limit for the agency to make a decision
with respect to challenges of ownership or control links or the status of violations. While OSM makes every effort
to decide these issues in an expeditious manner, the review and determination of an ownership or control link can be
a complex endeavor, requiring the review of significant amounts of complex documentary material. Such a process
typically involves a dialogue involving the exchange of numerous documents and testimony between the agency and
the challenger. Such issues may require extensive research and investigation by trained specialists. The imposition
of artificial time limits on the process could create a risk that decisions will be inaccurate and that investigations
will be incomplete.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, there is no risk to the environment during the period of challenge. During the period of challenge, the permit
is not issued. Once a presumption of ownership or control has been established pursuant to 30 CFR 773.5 and such presumption
is shown on AVS, the burden is upon an applicant to rebut the presumption. The regulatory authority should not issue
the permit until the presumption has been rebutted. While an expeditious process is encouraged, the regulatory authority
should not be rushed in making such a decision. It should conduct a thorough investigation and review all of the relevant
evidence presented. Some challenges can be resolved within 30 days. Other challenges may require six months. Imposing
an absolute time limit disregards the differences that particular cases have with respect to factual and legal complexity.
Accordingly, OSM must reject the commenters' suggestion that a time limit should be incorporated into the proposed
regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter representing State regulatory authorities criticized the provisions of proposed &sect;773.24 which
would require that challenges of ownership or control links shown on AVS be heard before OSM. In substance, the commenter
was concerned that, for such challenges to be meaningfully addressed, OSM would need copies of supporting documentation
from the States and challengers would be referred to the States to review various documents with respect to ownership
or control relationships and with respect to violations. The commenter asserted that the States would have an ``unnecessary
burden'' to provide duplicate copies of documents to OSM and other participants.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While OSM appreciates commenter's concern, OSM disagrees that the process provided in the proposed rule will impose
an unnecessary burden upon the States. Under the proposed regulation, OSM is assuming the responsibility to entertain
challenges to ownership or control information shown on AVS. In the absence of OSM's assumption of such responsibility,
the States would have to hear such challenges. Further, regardless of which party assumes responsibility for addressing
such challenges, that party would have to obtain complete documentation from all other parties which might have relevant
records. Thus, each State would have to provide copies of essential documentation to the participants and to whichever
regulatory authority was reviewing the case, be it OSM or a specific State, to enable the challenges to be fairly considered
and resolved. It is in the interests of all concerned with the process_including OSM, the States, the challengers,
and the public_that determinations of such challenges are based upon a complete administrative record. OSM is confident
that the cooperative relationship between OSM and the States which has characterized the development and implementation
of AVS would be carried forward with respect to challenges of ownership or control information on AVS made before OSM.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters representing State regulatory authorities also questioned whether proposed &sect;773.24 was inconsistent
with other provisions of the proposed rules which would allocate responsibility to State regulatory authorities
to make ownership or control decisions. In support of these positions, the commenters cited the provisions of proposed
&sect;773.26(b) which they considered to be inconsistent with proposed &sect;773.24. As is noted elsewhere in this
preamble, proposed &sect;773.26 is being modified, renumbered, and adopted today as final &sect;773.25. The commenters
were concerned that there would be confusion in the permit application process if OSM would be the deciding agency
with respect to ownership or control information on AVS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM disagrees with the commenters' analysis. The provisions of proposed &sect;773.24 were designed to avoid confusion.
In substance, the proposed rule would provide challengers with a single forum, OSM, before which they could contest
ownership or control information shown on AVS. The alternative to the proposed rule's approach would be for challengers
to challenge ownership or control links shown on AVS before the various States. There is a greater likelihood of inconsistent
results with multiple jurisdictions making such decisions as opposed to a single agency making such decisions. Further,
the content of AVS would be subject to such inconsistency, since the resolution of challenges would have to be reflected
in the AVS database. Given that AVS is a national database which is used across State lines, there is a need for consistency
in the decisionmaking which forms the content of AVS. Moreover, the approach provided in proposed &sect;773.24 is
consistent with that provided in proposed &sect;773.26(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b)(1)(i) of proposed &sect;773.26 would provide that the regulatory authority before which an application
is pending has authority for making decisions with respect to the ownership or control of the applicant. Paragraph
(b)(1)(ii) of proposed &sect;773.26 would provide that the regulatory authority that issued a permit would have
authority for making decisions with respect to the ownership or control of the permittee. As will be discussed below
in detail, OSM's final regulation adopted as final &sect;773.25 modifies this language to refer to ownership or control
of applications, permits, and violations, rather than ownership or control of applicants, permittees, and violators.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under paragraph (b) of proposed &sect;773.26, the authority of the regulatory authority is initial authority, subject
to OSM's oversight. Under that paragraph of proposed &sect;773.26, a regulatory authority would analyze the facts
and make an initial decision with respect to the ownership or control links of an applicant or a permittee. Such decision
would be subject to OSM's oversight. Then, the regulatory authority would enter such information into AVS, to the
extent necessary to update the system. The entry of such information into AVS would also be subject to OSM's oversight.
Since OSM has ultimate authority, through the exercise of oversight, as to the content of the ownership or control
information on AVS, it is consistent for OSM to be the single forum for the challenge of ownership or control information
shown on AVS as provided by proposed &sect;773.24. If OSM later amends the AVS to reflect a different conclusion with
respect to a particular ownership or control link than that reached by a State regulatory authority, that reflects
OSM's exercise of its oversight authority and its responsibility for the ownership or control information contained
in AVS. If a regulatory authority would then consider a subsequent application, it would be required to review AVS
and to factor the information shown in AVS, as amended by OSM, into the regulatory authority's decision with respect
to the later permit application. Thus, proposed &sect;&sect;773.24 and 773.26 are consistent with each other and
will not lead to confusion in the permit application process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter representing State regulatory authorities also proposed a revision of proposed &sect;773.24 such that
OSM's decisions made under the proposed regulation would be considered preliminary decisions which would become
final within 30 days thereafter if the person challenging the link could show no valid reason why the decision should
not become final. The commenter asserted that such a provision would enable the challenger to provide supplemental
information which could lead to a corrected final decision and, thus, obviate the need for an appeal to OHA.

OSM appreciates the commenter's suggestion. OSM believes, however, that persons should have the opportunity to
seek review of the agency's decision by OHA as soon as possible upon the agency's determination that they are linked,
through ownership or control, to violations. In the absence of a final agency decision, such review by OHA would not
be routinely available. Accordingly, the proposed regulation provides for a final agency decision which may then
be appealed to OHA by a challenger. If a challenger has new information which would lead OHA to conclude that the challenger
is likely to win a reversal of OSM's decision, then such information would support temporary relief with respect to
the decision. On the other hand, where OSM has reviewed information submitted and concluded that an ownership or control
link has been severed, OSM may choose to reserve the right to reopen such decision in the event that new information
or evidence comes to light subsequently. Such reservation of the right to reopen by the agency would be necessary to
assure that the agency can correct its mistakes and assure the accuracy of the AVS. Thus, OSM can supplement the record
with information discovered subsequent to any decision. Accordingly, OSM has determined not to adopt the commenter's
proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the above discussion, OSM has decided to adopt a final version of &sect;773.24 which is substantively
similar to the proposed version. OSM has, however, made some minor modifications to the proposed rule which are now
described.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In paragraph (a)(1) of the proposed rule, the rule provided for the challenge of links by persons linked to any person
cited in a Federal or State violation notice. At the time that this proposal was published in September, 1991, OSM expected
that most challenges would be by persons seeking to challenge links to violators to avoid permit blocks. In actuality,
members of the regulated community have also routinely come before OSM seeking to challenge ownership or control
links to persons who are not violators. The language of the proposal did not reflect this reality and was, therefore,
too narrow. Further, the language was potentially inconsistent with language contained in the 1988 preamble to OSM's
ownership and control rules. In that preamble, OSM stated, in relevant part, as follows:

See Preamble to Requirements for Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Permit Approval; Ownership and Control; Final
Rule, 53 FR 38868 at page 38879 (October 3, 1988). Accordingly, the final rule broadens the proposed language to provide
that ``[a]ny applicant or other person shown in AVS in an ownership or control link to any person may challenge such
link'' even if the link is to persons who are not violators. OSM intends to protect due process rights and provide an
efficient avenue to challenge information shown on AVS. The substance of paragraph (a)(1) of the rule proposed in
September, 1991 is otherwise retained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;773.24 has been further modified to delete references in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) to proposed
&sect;773.26 and substitute references to final &sect;773.25 in the place of the deleted section references. This
reflects OSM's renumbering of the sections of the proposed rule. No substantive change in the rule has been made by
such modification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) of proposed &sect;773.24 would have required that a person seeking to challenge ownership or control
links or the status of Federal violations submit to OSM a written explanation of the basis for his or her challenge and
provide relevant evidentiary materials and supporting documents. Proposed paragraph (b) did not explicitly state
that the process of challenge described in this paragraph applied to links 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
shown in AVS. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
That was OSM's intent, however, as stated in the preamble to the proposed rule. Accordingly, OSM has corrected the
oversight in the rule language by explicitly incorporating this language into this final rule.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (c) of proposed &sect;773.24 has been adopted as proposed. This provision requires OSM to make a written
determination with respect to the ownership or control link and/or with respect to the status of the violation. The
provision of the rule requires that, if an ownership or control link is challenged, OSM then determines whether the
link has been shown to be erroneous or has been rebutted. While no change has been made to the proposed rule, OSM believes
that the following explanation will be helpful in clarifying the operation of the rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the rule, a determination that a link is ``erroneous'' means that the facts in the case show that no ownership
or control relationship set forth in 30 CFR 773.5 ever existed. Thus, if an individual is shown on AVS as being linked
to a corporation by virtue of his or her position as an officer of such corporation, see 30 CFR 773.5(b)(1), evidence
demonstrating that such individual is not and has never been an officer of the corporation would support a determination
that an ownership or control link based upon such a relationship is erroneous.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A determination that a link has been ``rebutted'' means that, while the facts in the case show that a presumed ownership
or control relationship as set forth in 30 CFR 773.5(b) exists or existed, sufficient evidence has been presented
to demonstrate that the ``person subject to the presumption [did] *&blank;*&blank;* not in fact have the authority
directly or indirectly to determine the manner in which the relevant surface coal mining operation [was] conducted
*&blank;*&blank;*.'' See 30 CFR 773.5(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, if the individual in the preceding example was, in fact, an officer of the corporation, but did not have
authority or demonstrated control over the conduct of the surface coal mining operation, the presumption of ownership
or control would be rebutted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions of paragraph (d) of the proposed rule have been adopted as proposed. Paragraph (d)(2)(i) of &sect;773.24
provides that OSM is required to serve a copy of its decision with respect to a challenge upon the applicant or other
challenger by U.S. certified mail or by any other means consistent with the rules governing service of a summons and
complaint under Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The date of service of the decision will set a date certain from which the time for appeals will begin to run. The regulation
provides that service is complete upon tender of the notice or of the mail and is not deemed incomplete by virtue of a
challenger's refusal to accept the notice or mail. The theory of this provision is to assure that a challenger is not
able to delay the running of the time for appeal by avoiding or refusing service of OSM's decision and then claiming
that he or she was never served.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of &sect;773.24 has been adopted as proposed. As provided in the proposed rule, the final version
of this paragraph provides that the applicant or other challenger can appeal OSM's decision to OHA within 30 days of
such decision in accordance with OHA regulations at 43 CFR 4.1380 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

decision in these matters with the opportunity to appeal the decision to OHA.

The preamble to the ownership or control rules published in 1988 provided that appeals by individuals from OSM decisions
with respect to information contained in AVS were made to the Department's Assistant Secretary_Policy, Management,
and Budget under procedures developed under the Privacy Act of 1974. Appeals by entities other than individuals were
made to OHA. See Preamble to Requirements for Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Permit Approval; Ownership and
Control; Final Rule, 53 FR 38868 at page 38879 (``Procedures to Amend Applicant Violator System Information'') (October
3, 1988).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1993, pursuant to a delegation from the Department's Assistant Secretary_Policy, Management and Budget, the
authority to decide appeals with respect to information contained in AVS was delegated to OHA. Consistent with such
delegation, OSM believes that a single process of appeal for both individuals and entities will promote consistency
for both the public and the regulated community and that such appeal process should be explicitly contained in the
final rule. As provided in the proposed rule, paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of the final rule provides that OSM's decision
would remain in effect unless temporary relief were granted in accordance with OHA regulations at 43 CFR 4.1386.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of &sect;773.24 provides for temporary relief from OSM's decision, if OHA grants such relief
in accordance with OHA regulations at 43 CFR part 4. Under the final regulation, the period during which a person may
file a notice of appeal or the actual filing of an appeal will not automatically suspend the use of the information in
AVS during the pendency of such appeal. The challenger will have to explicitly seek such relief in appeal proceedings
before OHA and be granted such relief. See also 43 CFR 4.21(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In considering a request for temporary relief, OHA will apply the criteria of Section 525(c) of the Act, 30 U.S.C. 1275(c),
to determine whether such relief is warranted. See OHA regulations at 43 CFR 4.1386. To grant temporary relief under
such criteria, OHA will have to find that the challenger has a substantial likelihood of prevailing in his appeal of
the OSM decision and that temporary relief, if granted, will not adversely affect the health or safety of the public
or cause significant, imminent environmental harm to land, air, or water resources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining whether the granting of temporary relief would cause significant, imminent environmental harm,
OHA will not attempt to decide whether a denial of temporary relief will compel the applicant or other challenger to
abate a violation posing such harm. It is not the intent of these rules to force a person to abate a violation even if he
or she is able to show a substantial likelihood that he or she had no ownership or control over the operation that is in
violation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Instead, OHA will focus its attention upon the compliance history of those persons who do appear to have had ownership
or control over operations in violation, to determine whether the granting of temporary relief would pose a risk of
significant, imminent environmental harm at sites for which new permits could be issued during the pendency of the
appeal process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the above discussion, the provisions of the proposed rule are adopted with the modifications noted.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Withdrawal of former proposed &sect;773.25 which would have provided procedures for challenging ownership or control
links prior to entry in AVS.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the September, 1991 proposal, OSM proposed a rule to provide procedures for challenging ownership or control links
prior to entry in AVS. That proposal which was numbered as proposed &sect;773.25 represented OSM's attempt to go beyond
the Constitutional requirements of due process. The proposal would have prospectively required OSM or a State regulatory
authority to provide notice to those persons who were actively involved in surface coal mining operations and who
were linked to a violation through ownership or control before such link information would be used to subject them
to permit denial through AVS. Such persons would then have had an opportunity to challenge such information. Upon
further consideration, OSM has decided to withdraw the proposed regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM believes that adequate due process rights to notice and an opportunity to be heard are afforded by current practices
which permit a challenge to ownership or control and violation information after it is incorporated into AVS. Such
challenges can be made currently both within the context of a permit application and independent of such an application.
OSM believes that these opportunities suffice to pass constitutional muster. See Preamble to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Requirements for Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Permit Approval; Ownership and Control; Final Rule, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
53 FR 38868 at page 38885 (``Due Process Provided'') and at page 38879 (``Procedures to Amend Applicant Violator System
Information'') (October 3, 1988).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the Department's OHA is contemporaneously adopting a rule providing for temporary relief from an ownership
or control link, under specified conditions. Such a rule significantly enhances the already available due process
protections available to the members of the regulated community. The risk that someone will be inappropriately subjected
to a permit block due to an erroneous link is substantially mitigated by the temporary relief procedures available
before OHA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, the proposed rule would have subjected OSM and State regulatory authorities to a substantial paperwork
morass as a condition precedent to implementing the provisions of &sect;510(c) of the Act. OSM, which has been utilizing
procedures similar to those proposed in the September, 1991, rule, discovered that the process was taking substantial
amounts of time and resources to implement. The dialogue and paper exchange between the agency and persons debating
the proposed ownership or control link was a prolonged exercise lasting, in some cases, for many months. Also, OSM
was finding that most of these debates made no difference in the ultimate outcome, except where entities refuted the
facts which would invoke a link. Typically, the ownership or control link was found to be well taken. The prolonged
debate was preventing accurate information from being incorporated into AVS. During the period of the dialogue,
the individual or entity subject to the ownership or control link was not relieved of the cloud of the potential link
and the agency was not able to directly implement the link. Neither OSM nor the person challenging the link benefited
by this course of events.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, industry, environmental advocates, and representatives of State regulatory authorities were dissatisfied
with the proposed rule. Industry commenters condemned the proposed rule as providing insufficient due process for
challengers of ownership or control links. Environmental advocates criticized the proposal as deficient in not
providing a set time frame for OSM to bring ownership or control decisions to closure and to incorporate such decisions
into AVS. A commenter representing State regulatory authorities asserted that the proposed rules should either
provide for no challenge of an ownership or control link prior to permit denial or for conditional issuance of a permit
pending full challenge of an ownership or control link. As is stated above in the portion of this preamble captioned
``Due Process,'' OSM is unwilling, for a number of significant reasons, to accept that permits may be conditioned
upon the appeal of ownership or control links. Nevertheless, the criticisms of the commenter representing the State
regulatory authorities, the industry commenters, and the environmental advocacy groups also caused OSM to reconsider
the proposed rules.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Given that the incorporation of accurate and complete information into AVS in a timely manner is critical to the development
and implementation of AVS, OSM believes that the needs of these constituent groups are addressed more effectively
by the provisions of the OHA rule. OSM remains committed to developing complete and accurate information for entry
into AVS, and as part of this process will of course consider information submitted by any party which would establish
or refute facts relevant to an ownership or control link. To the extent that a person is injured by an erroneous ownership
or control link, the OHA temporary relief procedure quickly and effectively neutralizes such injury in a timely manner.
The availability of such a process enables OSM to go forward in an expeditious manner to utilize its resources to develop
information, rather than engage in prolonged paper exchanges; to avoid delay in incorporating information into
AVS, thus responding to the concerns of environmental advocates; and to address effectively the concerns of the industry
which can invoke an administrative process outside of OSM for quick relief if the claims of injury are meritorious.
Additionally, by enabling challengers to go to OHA more quickly, the focus of the challenge procedures shifts to OHA,
a forum created to address such challenges of agency decisions. Finally, OSM can meet the terms of its continuing mandate
from Congress to develop and implement the AVS.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In appropriate cases, OSM may engage in a dialogue and exchange of documents with persons subject to a proposed ownership
or control link prior to incorporating an ownership or control link into AVS. OSM will do this, however, only when OSM
believes it needs additional information concerning the proposed ownership or control link. In that case, such a
dialogue would enhance OSM's investigative process and assist in the development of relevant information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the above, OSM has withdrawn this portion of the September, 1991, proposal and is renumbering the
remaining provisions of the final rules presented today to reflect the deletion of former proposed &sect;773.25.

Section 773.25_Standards for Challenging Ownership or Control Links and the Status of Violations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Proposed section 773.26 would have established standards for challenges to ownership or control links and for challenges
to the status of violations. The proposed section would have allocated responsibilities between OSM and State regulatory
authorities for resolving issues related to ownership and control and would have provided the substantive criteria
for resolving such issues. In recognition of OSM's withdrawal of former proposed &sect;773.25, proposed &sect;773.26
has been renumbered as final rule &sect;773.25. For the reasons discussed below, the final rule also has been modified
to delete the substantive criteria to resolve ownership or control issues previously contained in the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a) of proposed &sect;773.26 provided that its provisions would have been applicable to any challenge
concerning an ownership or control link or the status of a violation when such challenge was made under the provisions
of 30 CFR 773.20 and 30 CFR 773.21 (improvidently issued permits); proposed &sect;773.23 (the regulatory authority's
review of ownership or control and violation information), proposed &sect;773.24 (procedures for challenging
ownership or control links shown in AVS), and proposed &sect;773.25 (procedures for challenging ownership or control
links prior to entry in AVS); or 30 CFR part 775 (administrative and judicial review of permitting decisions).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) of proposed &sect;773.26 would have provided the basic allocation of authority among regulatory authorities
to make decisions with respect to ownership or control and with respect to the status of violations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b)(1)(i) of proposed &sect;773.26 would have provided that the regulatory authority before which an
application was pending would have had authority for making decisions with respect to the ownership or control of
the applicant. Such regulatory authority would have had responsibility for reviewing information submitted by
the applicant and other available information to ensure the complete identification of the applicant's ownership
or control links.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of proposed &sect;773.26 would have provided that the regulatory authority that issued a permit
would have had authority for making decisions with respect to the ownership or control of the permittee. Such decisions
would be necessary in determining whether the permit was improvidently issued, pursuant to 30 CFR 773.20. The regulatory
authority which issued a permit would have done so based upon a complete review of ownership or control information.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of proposed &sect;773.26 would have provided that the State regulatory authority that issued
a State violation notice would have had authority for making decisions with respect to the ownership or control of
any person cited in the notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of proposed &sect;773.26 would have provided that the regulatory authority that issued a violation
notice, whether State or Federal, would have had authority for making decisions concerning the status of the violation
covered by the notice. The ``status'' of the violation meant whether the violation remained outstanding, had been
corrected, was in the process of being corrected, or was the subject of a good faith appeal, within the meaning of 30
CFR 773.15(b)(1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b)(2) of proposed &sect;773.26 would have provided that OSM would have authority for making decisions
with respect to the ownership or control of any person cited in a Federal violation notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the allocation principles set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of the proposed rule, a regulatory authority
that was deciding whether a permit application should be granted or whether a permit had been improvidently issued
would have determined for itself the ownership or control of the applicant or permittee, but it would have deferred
to the regulatory authority that issued a violation notice for a determination of the ownership or control of the violator.
The application would be blocked or the permit would be found improvidently issued if any owner or controller of the
applicant or permittee were also an owner or controller of a violator, as determined by the respective regulatory
authorities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b)(3) of proposed &sect;773.26 would have provided that the authority of State regulatory authorities
to make decisions with respect to ownership or control links or the status of violations would have been subject to
OSM's oversight authority under 30 CFR parts 733, 842, and 843. Under paragraph (b)(3) of proposed &sect;773.26,
when OSM disagreed with a decision of a State regulatory authority, it would have taken action, as appropriate, under
proposed &sect;843.24, oversight of State permitting decisions with respect to ownership or control of the status
of violations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) of proposed &sect;773.26 would have established evidentiary standards applicable to the formal and
informal review of ownership or control links and the status of violations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(1) of proposed &sect;773.26 would have provided that in any formal or informal review of an ownership
or control link or of the status of a violation, the agency responsible for making a decision would be required to make
first a prima facie determination or showing that the link exists or that the violation remains outstanding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under paragraph (c) of proposed &sect;773.26, a challenger of a link to a violation would have had to prove at least
one of three proposed conclusions by a preponderance of the evidence to succeed in his or her challenge.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of proposed &sect;773.26, a challenger could have proven that the facts relied
upon by the responsible agency to establish ownership or control within the terms of 30 CFR 773.5(a) or to establish
a presumption of ownership or control under 30 CFR 773.5(b) do not or did not exist.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of proposed &sect;773.26 provided that a person subject to a presumption of ownership or control
under 30 CFR 773.5(b) could have rebutted such presumption by demonstrating that he or she does not or did not in fact
have the authority directly or indirectly to determine the manner in which surface coal mining operations are or were
conducted. Such demonstration would have been made in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d) of proposed
&sect;773.26.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of proposed &sect;773.26 provided that a challenger could have proven that the violation
covered by a violation notice did not exist, had been corrected, was in the process of being corrected, or was the subject
of a good faith appeal within the meaning of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(2) of proposed section 773.26 described the type of evidence that a person challenging an ownership
or control link or the status of a violation would have had to present to meet the burden of proof by a preponderance of
the evidence. The proposed regulation provided that the evidence presented would have had to have been probative,
reliable, and substantial. See 5 U.S.C. 556(d).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of proposed &sect;773.26 provided that a challenger could have submitted affidavits setting
forth specific facts concerning the scope of responsibility of the various owners or controllers of an applicant,
a permittee, or any person cited in a violation notice; the duties actually performed by such owners or controllers;
the beginning and ending dates of such owners' or controllers' affiliation with the applicant, permittee, or person
cited in a violation notice; and the nature and details of any transaction creating or severing an ownership or control
link; or specific facts concerning the status of the violation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraphs (c)(2)(i)(B) and (c)(2)(i)(C) of proposed &sect;773.26 looked to official certification as the basis
for the reliability of a submitted document. Paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B) would have allowed for the submission of certified
copies of corporate minutes, stock ledgers, contracts, purchase and sale agreements, leases, correspondence,
or other relevant company records. Paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C) would have allowed for the submission of certified copies
of documents filed with or issued by any State, municipal, or Federal governmental agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(2)(i)(D) of proposed &sect;773.26 provided for a challenger's submission of an opinion of counsel
in support of his or her position. Under the proposed rule, such opinion would have been appropriate for submission
when it was supported by evidentiary materials and when it was rendered by an attorney who certified that he or she had
personally and diligently investigated the facts of the matter and that he or she was qualified to render the opinion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of proposed &sect;773.26 provided that, when the decision of the responsible agency was reviewed
by an administrative or judicial tribunal, the challenger could have presented any evidence to such tribunal which
was admissible under the rules of the tribunal. Under the proposed regulation, however, the evidence submitted would
still have to have been probative, credible, and substantial.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d) of proposed &sect;773.26 represented OSM's attempt to offer substantive standards which would have
established what must be proved by those seeking to rebut the presumptions of ownership or control contained in current
&sect;773.5(b) of this title. Proof of the facts set forth in the proposed regulation would have established that
the presumed owner or controller did not, in fact, have the authority directly or indirectly to determine the manner
in which the relevant surface coal mining operation was conducted, under the provisions of 30 CFR 773.5(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, the proposed standards contained in paragraph (d) of proposed &sect;773.26 would have allowed a presumed
owner or controller to demonstrate that he or she lacked control over a surface coal mining operation by presenting
evidence that he or she actually lacked authority directly or indirectly to determine the manner in which the relevant
surface coal mining operation would be conducted. In the alternative, with respect to a presumed owner or controller
of a violator, the proposed standards would have allowed a person to present evidence that he or she took all reasonable
steps within his or her authority to cause the violation to be abated and that such abatement was prevented by those
in actual control of the mining operation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (e) of proposed &sect;773.26 would have provided for the review and revision of information in AVS to reflect
determinations made by regulatory authorities in response to challenges of ownership or control links or the status
of violations. The proposed provision would have provided that, following any determination by a State regulatory
authority or other State agency, or following any decision by an administrative or judicial tribunal reviewing such
determination, the State regulatory authority would have been required to review the information in AVS to determine
if such information was consistent with the determination or decision. If it were not consistent, the State regulatory
authority would have been required to promptly inform OSM and to request that the AVS information be revised to reflect
the determination or decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industry commenters criticized the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of proposed &sect;773.26 as violating due
process by not providing an owner or controller with the opportunity to challenge the existence of the violation at
the time it was cited. They further criticized the provisions of the proposed rule as violating State primacy. In substance,
they asserted that the proposed rule ``balkanized'' the permit application process by allowing the regulatory authority
that issued a violation to identify the ownership or control links to the violation. They asserted that this provision
impermissibly allowed such regulatory authority to play a role in the permit application process. They further argued
that the regulatory authority before which an application was pending should be the sole decisionmaker.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM disagrees with these views. OSM has already addressed these issues in detail in previous sections of this preamble
captioned ``Due Process'' and ``Primacy.'' Further, OSM has clarified that a permittee may, within the context of
the improvident permit issuance process, challenge the existence of the violation at the time it was cited. See discussion
above in this preamble, ``Section 773.20_Improvidently Issued Permits: General Procedures.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A commenter representing State regulatory authorities took exception to the provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of proposed
&sect;773.26 which would have provided that State determinations of ownership or control challenges be subject
to OSM's oversight authority. The commenter asserted that those provisions were duplicative of other provisions
of current regulations which provide for OSM's oversight of the States such as 30 CFR parts 733, 842, and 843. He further
asserted that the Act established OSM's oversight power over the States and that such power required no reiteration
by the proposed regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, commenters representing State regulatory authorities argued that, under a system of State primacy,
OSM has no authority to act, on a case by case basis, with respect to a particular permit decision by a State regulatory
program, other than revoking the State's approved regulatory program. Thus, they questioned OSM's authority to
review a State's decision with respect to ownership or control. They also argued that, if OSM review of State ownership
or control decisions was done, this would lead to duplication and disruption in the permit application process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While these commenters asserted that the provisions of the proposed regulation should be deleted, they proposed
that, if OSM insisted on going forward with the proposed provision or a similar rule providing for OSM oversight of
State decisions, the final rule should make explicit that the initial decision of a State regulatory authority with
respect to an ownership or control issue would be considered presumptively correct. They also proposed that a standard
such as ``gross inadequacy'' should be the standard for OSM to apply to the review of the State decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM disagrees with the commenters' analysis. First, OSM rejects the commenters' view that the proposed regulation
is unnecessary since the Act and regulations already provide for OSM's oversight of the States. The provisions of
SMCRA such as sections 201, 503, 504, 505, and 521, and the provisions of the Federal regulations at 30 CFR parts 733,
842, and 843 do establish a system of State primacy subject to Federal oversight. Nevertheless, such provisions do
not explicitly address every question which could arise in the implementation of the relationship between OSM and
the States with respect to &sect;510(c) of the Act which, as has been previously discussed in this preamble, invokes
significant issues of State primacy and Federal oversight. Further, the implementation of the AVS also invokes issues
of State primacy and Federal oversight. Multiple State regulatory authorities and OSM will be making ownership or
control decisions at various stages which are relevant to issues arising under section 510(c) of the Act. While the
proposed regulation is consistent with the Act and with OSM's existing regulations, the proposed regulation's allocation
of responsibilities among the regulatory authorities who will be making ownership or control decisions relevant
to section 510(c) of the Act has not been previously part of the Federal regulations. The allocation of responsibilities
provides necessary clarification to the regulated community, to regulatory authorities, and to the public. Accordingly,
OSM must reject the view that the proposed regulation is duplicative of current regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM further rejects the view that, under a system of State primacy, OSM has no authority to act, on a case by case basis,
with respect to a particular permit decision by a State regulatory program, other than revoking the State's approved
regulatory program. A number of provisions of the Federal regulations, including 30 CFR 842.11 and 843.21, are very
explicit in providing that OSM can exercise necessary oversight authority with respect to a particular permit without
revoking a State's entire regulatory program. These other provisions are consistent with the system of State primacy
established by SMCRA. The proposed regulation is similarly consistent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, OSM has a particularly strong interest in working to assure that ownership or control decisions are made
correctly because the fruits of such decisionmaking will be incorporated into AVS. As has been previously discussed,
AVS is used across State lines by the various State regulatory authorities and by OSM itself. Accordingly, a decision
made with respect to an ownership or control link by one State regulatory authority has the potential to effect the
outcomes of permit decisions by many regulatory authorities. Without consistency, there would be chaos. Federal
oversight in these matters supports consistency among the various States in the application of the ownership or control
rules and the outcomes of the decisions on ownership or control issues. Since these State decisions are ultimately
incorporated into AVS, OSM's oversight supports the quality of the AVS.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Also, there is no reason to conclude that the exercise of Federal oversight, pursuant to the provisions of the proposed
regulation, will lead to disruption in the permit application process. Paragraph (b)(1) of proposed &sect;773.26
and the provisions of the final regulation discussed below are designed to avoid such disruption by allocating responsibilities
among the various regulatory authorities who each have a legitimate interest in the outcome of an ownership or control
issue. The oversight provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of proposed &sect;773.26 are designed to support such allocation
of responsibilities in a way that is consistent with SMCRA and OSM's implementing regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM further believes that the commenter's proposal that a final rule should make explicit that the initial decision
of a State regulatory authority with respect to an ownership or control issue will be considered presumptively correct
is adequately addressed. In substance, the provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of final &sect;773.25 discussed below
already provide that State regulatory authorities who are issuing violations, considering permit applications,
and issuing permits with the first opportunity to decide the owners or controllers of, respectively, violations,
applications, and permits. While the first opportunity to make a particular decision is not equivalent to a legal
presumption in favor of the decision, such an opportunity does give a State regulatory authority the chance to define
the status quo which would be subject to oversight review. OSM declines, however, to convert such initial decisionmaking
opportunity into a presumption. The need for consistency with respect to ownership or control decisions and with
respect to AVS require that OSM conduct oversight reviews of such State decisions as are necessary without the application
of a presumption favoring the affirmance of such decisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM also declines to incorporate a standard such as ``gross inadequacy'' or some other criterion as the basis for Federal
oversight of State ownership or control decisions under paragraph (b)(3) of proposed &sect;773.26. The application
of such a standard would limit OSM's ability to review State decisions for purposes of protecting the consistency
and accuracy of information in the AVS. As will be discussed with respect to the final rule &sect;773.25 below, OSM
has made modifications to proposed &sect;773.26 to reflect OSM's responsibility for the ownership or control information
shown on AVS and to enable OSM to act to maintain the integrity of the AVS database. With respect to oversight incident
to particular applications, permits, and violations, paragraph (b)(3) of proposed &sect;773.26 already contains
references to 30 CFR parts 733, 842, and 843. Final rule &sect;773.25 contains identical references. Each of these
parts of Title 30 of the Code of Federal Regulations contains provisions which have explicit criteria and triggering
standards for OSM's review and action with respect to State decisions. Such criteria and standards are incorporated
by reference in paragraph (b)(3) of proposed &sect;773.26 and would be applied, as appropriate, by OSM. Accordingly,
there is no need for additional review criteria in OSM's oversight under the proposed regulation. As discussed below,
final rule &sect;773.25 adopts the same approach.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter representing environmental advocacy groups questioned whether the provisions of paragraph (b) of proposed
&sect;773.26 sufficiently explained the allocation of responsibilities between OSM and State regulatory authorities.
The commenter questioned the provision of the proposal contained at paragraph (b)(3) which provided that State regulatory
authorities' authority to make ownership or control decisions would be subject to OSM's review as an element of State
program oversight. The commenter asserted that this provision required further clarification as to the respective
roles of OSM and the State regulatory authorities in the making of ownership or control decisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM agrees with the commenter's observation that further clarification is in order with respect to the allocation
of responsibilities and authority contained in paragraph (b)(3) of proposed &sect;773.26. Accordingly, OSM has
made a change to the final rule to clarify that, with respect to information shown on AVS, State responsibilities to
make decisions with respect to ownership or control are subject to OSM's plenary authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, under the final rule, once ownership or control information is entered into AVS, OSM will assume control of such
data. If OSM reviews such information and concludes that it is incorrect, OSM will act to correct such ownership or
control information and will incorporate such corrected information into AVS. The rationale for OSM's plenary authority
is that AVS is used across State lines by all of the State regulatory authorities and the Federal government must act
to protect the accuracy and integrity of AVS. With respect to the State regulatory authority's decision underlying
such ownership or control information, OSM will further act pursuant to the provisions of final &sect;843.24, which
is described in detail below.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Nevertheless, OSM must reject the view that, because ownership or control issues are invoked, OSM must be initially
involved in every permit application decision made by a State regulatory authority. The primary responsibility
and authority for making a decision whether to issue or deny a permit is with the regulatory authority before which
an application is pending. The primary responsibility and authority under a State regulatory program for issuing
a violation is with that State's regulatory authority. The primary responsibility for the ongoing supervision of
a permit is with the State regulatory authority which issued the permit. Accordingly, while OSM has changed some of
the terminology in the final rule for reasons which are discussed below, OSM has not changed the basic conceptual framework
contained in paragraph (b)(3) of proposed section 773.26. That framework is that the regulatory authority which
is considering an application, which has issued a permit, or which has issued a violation has initial authority for
making decisions with respect to the ownership or control relationships respectively invoked by the application,
the permit, and the violation. OSM has program oversight authority of such decisions under 30 CFR parts 733, 842, and
843.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This commenter further indicated that the provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of the proposed section allocated the authority
to review State decisions with respect to permit applications to OSM, but that OSM could exercise such authority only
after a permit had been issued, in accordance with proposed &sect;843.24, and that this would cause friction between
OSM and the States. The commenter proposed that, if OSM believed that an ownership or control link had not been made
or had been severed improperly by a State regulatory authority considering a permit application, the permit should
not be issued until OSM and the State regulatory authority resolved their dispute.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM appreciates the commenter's concern. In any system involving Federal oversight of the States, there is the potential
for disagreements between the States and the Federal government. SMCRA is no exception. For instance, the invocation
of the improvidently issued permit process by OSM, pursuant to 30 CFR 843.21, subjects the State's permit application
review process to close scrutiny with respect to the permit in question. This is one of the remedies provided in proposed
&sect;843.24 which paragraph (b)(3) of proposed &sect;773.26 would make applicable. There is potential for stress
in this process. To help avoid to improvident issuance of permits, however, OSM, through its AVS Office, has attempted
to be accessible to the States and to work with the States have the benefit of OSM's most current opinions with respect
to particular ownership or control situations. Whether a State regulatory authority chooses to avail itself of this
service is a matter within the discretion of the State regulatory authority which has the primary authority to decide
whether to issue a permit. Principles of State primacy make it inappropriate, however, to mandate such consultations
with respect to every permit application. Accordingly, OSM declines to modify the rule to mandate that OSM intervene
in the State permit application process to require that the State not issue a permit if OSM disagrees with the State's
resolution of an ownership or control issue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industry commenters criticized the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of proposed &sect;773.26. They questioned the
requirement contained in the proposed regulation that a regulatory authority make a prima facie determination whether
an ownership or control link exists to a violation and that such violation remains ``outstanding.'' They asserted
that the provisions of section 510(c) of the Act require the denial of permits for ``unabated'' violations only, not
``outstanding'' violations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM disagrees with the commenters' analysis. The provisions of section 510(c) of the Act require that a regulatory
authority not issue a permit if information available to it indicates that ``any surface coal mining operation owned
or controlled by the applicant 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
is currently in violation 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
of the Act'' or other laws specified. (Emphasis added.) Paragraph (c)(1) of proposed &sect;773.26 requires a prima
facie determination whether the violation covered by a violation notice ``remains outstanding.'' A violation which
``remains outstanding'' is one which is ``current.'' The plain meaning of these phrases is the same. Further, by the
use of the words ``remains outstanding'' in the proposed regulation, OSM did not intend to change the standard established
by section 510(c) of the Act. Instead, OSM merely sought, as the Federal agency charged with implementing SMCRA, to
provide a workable phrase defining a current violation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industry commenters further objected to paragraph (c)(1) of proposed &sect;773.26 insofar as such proposal required
an applicant to demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the applicant did not own or control the violator
within the meaning of the regulations. The commenters asserted that the imposition of such a burden of proof upon the
applicant was inconsistent with section 510(c) of the Act and that the use of such an evidentiary burden was only appropriate
for formal proceedings before tribunals, rather than informal proceedings before State regulatory authorities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM disagrees with commenters' objections. The imposition of such a burden of proof is entirely consistent with the
provisions of section 510(c) of the Act which require that, when available information indicates that a surface coal
mining operation ``owned or controlled by the applicant'' is in current violation of the Act or other laws listed,
the permit not be issued ``until the applicant submits proof that such violation has been corrected or is in the process
of being corrected.''

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Moreover, the statute is silent as to how an applicant may demonstrate that he or she does not own or control a surface
coal mining operation. Under the Act, it is the duty of OSM, the administrative agency charged with implementing the
Act, to ``publish and promulgate such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out the purposes and provisions
of *&blank;*&blank;* [the] Act.'' See section 201(c)(2) of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, OSM proposed, and today is finalizing, a regulation which carries out the purposes of section 510(c) of the Act
and places the burden of evidence production and persuasion upon the person challenging an ownership or control link
to a current violation. This is consistent with the provisions of that section of the Act which clearly place the burden
of going forward with proof that a violation has been corrected or is in the process of correction upon the applicant
who owns or controls a surface coal mining operation which is in violation of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, in the absence of some means of showing that he or she does not own or control a particular surface coal mining
operation which is in violation of the Act, an applicant who owned or controlled such an operation would only be able
to receive a permit if he or she could produce proof that the current violation was corrected or was in the process of
correction. As indicated above, consistent with its statutory role to propose regulations, OSM has provided the
``means'' for an applicant to show that he or she does not control a surface coal mining operation by establishing the
burden of proof and evidentiary standards contained in paragraph (c) of proposed &sect;773.26.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, OSM must reject the notion that the burden of proof contained in the proposed regulation is inappropriate
for use by State regulatory authorities. Burdens of proof are used in formal litigation before tribunals because
they are helpful to the resolution of such litigation. Such burdens establish the parameters of what parties to litigation
must do to prevail in their claims. Similarly, challengers of ownership or control links need to know what parameters
they need to meet in proceedings before regulatory authorities to challenge such links. Also, in making decisions
with respect to ownership or control or with respect to the status of violations, regulatory authorities need guidance
in assisting their decisionmaking process. In the absence of guidance establishing burdens of proof and evidentiary
standards, the resulting decisions made may be inconsistent and based upon uncertain standards. For instance, one
regulatory authority may believe the any quantity of evidence, including a mere scintilla, is sufficient to successfully
challenge an ownership or control link to a violation. Another regulatory authority may believe that a successful
challenge requires a challenger to demonstrate that an ownership or control link is rebutted beyond any reasonable
doubt.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, OSM's proposed rule has provided a single standard of persuasion and production, a preponderance of the evidence,
to be required for the successful challenge of an ownership or control link. OSM believes that such a standard represents
a prudent middle ground between the possible extremes of burdens of proof requiring a mere scintilla of evidence and
those requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt. OSM is confident that State regulatory authorities will be able
to implement such a standard and that it will prove helpful. Accordingly, OSM rejects the commenters' assertion that
the use of the evidentiary burden of production contained in the proposed rule is inappropriate for State regulatory
authorities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industry commenters further criticized paragraph (c)(1) of proposed &sect;773.26 for requiring, as one of the bases
to rebut a presumption of ownership or control, proof that the facts relied upon to establish such presumption do not
or did not exist. The commenters asserted that such a test may foreclose a demonstration that the regulatory authority
which established such presumption reached the wrong legal conclusion, notwithstanding the truth of the facts.
Further, the commenters asserted, in substance, that the provisions of the proposed section imply that the challenger
would have to disprove all of the facts which were considered by the agency which established the presumption of ownership
or control, not just the relevant facts which support the presumption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM does not agree with commenters' assertions. Paragraph (c)(1) of proposed &sect;773.26 was intended to provide
the parameters as to what factual demonstration must be made by a challenger of an ownership or control link. Accordingly,
paragraph (c)(1)(i) of proposed &sect;773.26 provision provides for the challenge of a link by proof that the facts
necessary to invoke the presumption of ownership or control did not or do not exist. Nothing in such proof of facts precludes
legal arguments which could be made, including those questioning the application of the presumption under the operative
facts. Further, facts relevant to that legal issue could be presented under the provisions of paragraph (c)(1)(ii)
of proposed &sect;773.26 which provides that a person could demonstrate that he or she does not or did not have authority
directly or indirectly to determine the manner in which surface coal mining operations are or were conducted.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Moreover, under the provisions of the proposed regulation, challengers would only have to present proof with respect
to factual issues which are relevant to the invocation of the presumption of ownership or control. If the presumption
turns upon certain key factual issues, these are the issues upon which the challenge will focus. Challengers will
not be required to disprove irrelevant facts which may have been included in the administrative record of the agency
which initially established the presumption of ownership or control.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The industry commenters further objected to paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of proposed &sect;773.26 which provides that
a person seeking to challenge a presumption could demonstrate that he or she did not have authority directly or indirectly
to determine the manner in which surface coal mining operations were conducted. The commenters questioned whether
the requirement that a person prove that he or she did not have such indirect authority was an attempt by OSM to impermissibly
extend the reach of the ownership or control regulations to cover persons remote from surface coal mining operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM denies that the proposed provision represents an attempt to impermissibly extend the reach of the ownership or
control regulations. In fact, the proposed standard was taken from currently operative ownership and control regulations.
The provisions of paragraph (b) of 30 CFR 773.5, which have been effective since November 2, 1988, state that a person
subject to one or more of the presumptions contained in paragraph (b) of that regulation is presumed to be an owner or
controller unless there is a demonstration that ``the person subject to the presumption does not in fact have the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
authority directly or indirectly
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to determine the manner in which the relevant surface coal mining operation is conducted.'' (Emphasis added.) This
is the same standard which is also contained in paragraph (a)(3) of 30 CFR 773.5. The purpose of this standard is to enable:

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
the regulatory authority *&blank;*&blank;* [to] examine any relationships and the facts surrounding them, such
as informal agreements, personal relationships, and the mining history of the parties in question to determine if
the relationship results in control over a surface coal mining operation. The regulatory authority may also consider
any of the circumstances surrounding a surface coal mining operation to determine control. Such circumstances might
include, for example, the fact that a person has financed the operation, or owns the equipment or the rights to the coal,
or directs on-site operations.

See Preamble to Requirements for Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Permit Approval; Ownership and Control; Final
Rule, 53 FR 38868 at page 38870 (October 3, 1988). Further, whether a person is ``remote'' in a corporate chain of command
is not the issue under the standard. The issue is whether the totality of the circumstances indicate that the person
had the authority to exercise control over the relevant surface coal mining operation. Such ``authority'' includes
control or the power to control.

Id., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
at pages 38870&hyph;38871. The resolution of such issues is necessary for the regulatory authority's analysis of
an ownership or control challenge. Accordingly, requiring a person challenging a presumption of ownership or control
to make such demonstration is appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Industry commenters proposed that paragraph (c) of proposed &sect;773.26 be modified to provide that a person challenging
the presumption be able to prove that the agency relied upon incorrect facts to support its determination of ownership
or control; that the person subject to the presumption did not have knowledge of the violation, did not authorize the
activity that led to the violation, or did not have direct authority to determine the manner in which surface coal mining
operations were conducted; or that the ownership or control link has been severed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM appreciates the commenters' proposal. Nevertheless, OSM will not adopt the commenters' proposed modifications
for the following reasons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of proposed &sect;773.26 already contain language providing for a challenger's
proof that the facts relied upon by regulatory authority to make a determination of ownership or control did not or
do not exist. Such language is inclusive of the commenters' proposal that a challenger be allowed to submit proof that
the agency relied upon incorrect facts to support its determination of ownership or control.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Further, the language contained in OSM's proposed regulation would also encompass the commenters' proposal that
a challenger be able to provide proof that an ownership or control link has been severed. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i)
of the proposed regulation, such proof would be included as evidence that the facts relied upon by the regulatory authority
to establish ownership or control or a presumption of ownership or control did not or do not exist. Whether such proof
is sufficient to support a successful challenge to an ownership or control link will depend upon the facts of each case.
OSM must reject the implication of commenters' proposal that the severance of a current ownership or control link
to a violator would relieve a person from permit block in all cases. For instance, if a person was an owner or controller
of a violator during the period in which the violation was committed, severance of his or her current ownership or control
relationship with the company would not relieve him or her of responsibility created through the prior ownership
or control link.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM must further reject commenters' proposal to the extent that it would establish a standard which would enable a
challenger of an ownership or control link to a violation to challenge the link by proof that he lacked knowledge of
the violation; that he did not authorize the activity which led to the violation; or that he did not have direct authority
to determine the manner in which surface coal mining operations were conducted. Commenters' proposal must be rejected
because it ignores the control which stems from indirect authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM agrees that all of commenters' proposed standards invoke factual matters which may be relevant when a regulatory
authority considers an ownership or control link to a violation. As such, proof of each of these matters could be presented
within the context of the presentation of facts made under paragraph (c) of proposed &sect;773.26. For instance,
proof presented that a person had no knowledge of a violation; that he or she did not actually authorize a violation;
or that he or she did not have direct authority for the surface coal mining operation may well reflect on the contours
of the person's responsibilities with a presumptively owned or controlled entity. Nevertheless, such facts may
also constitute a false shield which has been created to conceal the substantive, indirect control that the person
has over a surface coal mining operation. Commenters' proposal is flawed, therefore, because it would enable a challenger
to successfully challenge an ownership or control link by simply proving lack of actual knowledge, actual authority,
or direct control, without requiring proof that a presumed owner or controller also lacked indirect authority over
the surface coal mining operation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industry commenters further proposed a modification to paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of proposed &sect;773.26. In OSM's
proposal, that paragraph prohibited a challenge as to the existence of the violation within the context of a challenge
to an ownership or control link or a challenge to the status of the violation. Commenters proposed changes to allow
a challenge as to the existence of the violation at the time it was cited. For the reasons discussed with respect to this
issue in the section of this preamble captioned ``Due Process'' and in the previous discussion of changes made to final
&sect;773.20, OSM has generally rejected commenters' proposal but has accepted such proposal with respect to the
improvident permit issuance process. Also, at the time of permit denial, a permit applicant can appeal any reason
for such denial including the existence of a violation assuming that the applicant is not bound by a prior administrative
or judicial determination or has not had a prior opportunity to challenge the existence of the violation. Accordingly,
OSM has amended paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of final rule &sect;773.25 to clarify that a challenge may be made by a permittee
acting within the context of the improvident permit issuance process under &sect;&sect;773.20&hyph;773.21. This
is in recognition of the more significant interest that a permittee has in a permit compared to the limited interest
that an applicant has in a permit application. A permittee's ability to assert such a challenge will be limited, however,
if he or she had a prior opportunity to challenge the violation notice and failed to do so in a timely manner or if he or
she is bound by a prior administrative or judicial determination concerning the existence of the violation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter representing State regulatory authorities indicated concern that paragraph (c) of proposed &sect;773.26
contained legal terms such as ``prima facie determination,'' proof ``by a preponderance of the evidence,'' and ``probative,
reliable, and substantial evidence'' without providing definitions of such terms. The commenter indicated that
all of these terms have ``particular legal meanings.'' He urged that the proposed regulation be amended to incorporate
definitions of such terms, ``consistent with their common legal meanings.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM appreciates the commenter's proposal. OSM disagrees, however, with commenter's view that the cited terms need
formal definition in the proposed regulation. As commenter has correctly noted, each of the cited terms has a traditional,
common legal meaning. In a proceeding to challenge an ownership or control link or the status of a violation, such terms
would have their traditional legal meanings. It is anticipated that such meanings will further evolve on a case by
case basis over time. Finally, with respect to the terms ``probative, reliable, and substantial'' as such terms describe
evidence, paragraph (c)(2) of proposed &sect;773.26 provides some examples of this type of evidence.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A commenter representing a State regulatory authority criticized the provisions of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of the
proposed regulation because such provisions would potentially allow a challenger of an ownership or control link
to present evidence to a tribunal reviewing a decision of a regulatory authority which had not previously been presented
to the regulatory authority. The commenter proposed a modification to the regulation such that any evidence presented
on appeal by a challenger be limited to that which was presented to the regulatory authority at the time when the decision
being reviewed was made. The commenter proposed that evidence which was not reasonably available to the challenger
at the time of the regulatory authority's decision could, however, be presented for the consideration of the reviewing
tribunal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM appreciates the commenter's proposal. One legitimate approach to the process of such challenges might be to limit
the presentation of evidence on review to that which had been previously presented to the regulatory authority which
made the decision which has been subjected to review. OSM believes, however, that the better approach is to allow the
presentation of any evidence admissible under the rules of the reviewing tribunal, including evidence which was
not previously presented to the regulatory authority. This will assure that the review of the decision with respect
to the ownership or control link or the status of a violation is based upon the most complete evidence available to all
parties participating in the review process. Such a review will help assure that all parties have the opportunity
to present their complete proof with respect to their respective positions in what is, substantively, a de novo proceeding.
Such complete evidence presentation and review may aid the legitimacy and acceptance of any final decision made incident
to such review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, OSM disagrees with the view that such a process might encourage a challenger to withhold relevant evidence
for surprise presentation at a subsequent review proceeding. A challenger will have sufficient incentive to overcome
a presumed ownership or control link at the earliest possible time because he or she will want to avoid permit blocks
or further litigation. Accordingly, he or she can be expected to present the best evidence available to make the case
in favor of overcoming the presumed ownership or control link. Thus, OSM must reject the commenter's suggested modification
to the proposed regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters criticized paragraph (c)(2) of the proposed regulation for allowing the use of affidavits
in support of a challenge to an ownership or control link or to the status of a violation. The commenters asserted that
such materials contain self-serving statements and are unreliable. The commenters further asserted that affidavits
should not be the basis to overcome a presumption, in the absence of additional evidence supporting such affidavits.
The commenters proposed various modifications to the proposed rule which would require the submission of additional
information when affidavits are presented in support of a challenge to an ownership or control link. In this respect,
one commenter proposed a ``best evidence'' rule which would not allow the presentation of affidavits when there was
``better'' documentary evidence available, such as official copies of corporate records previously filed with
State corporation commissions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM appreciates the commenters' concern with respect to affidavits. Nevertheless, affidavits do have certain indicators
of reliability. They are made under oath before a government official licensed to witness such oaths, a notary public.
Further, affidavits are recognized as evidence sufficient to support a motion for summary judgment in civil litigation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Accordingly, OSM continues to consider affidavits as appropriate
evidence for a regulatory authority's review in the evaluation of a challenge to an ownership or control link.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nevertheless, OSM agrees that, in most cases, an affidavit unsupported by other evidence may be insufficient to overcome
a presumption of ownership or control. There could be rare circumstances, however, where an affidavit by itself could
be the basis for rebuttal, given the totality of the circumstances involved. Such matters are appropriately addressed
on a case by case basis, rather than through a rule. Under the proposed rule, challengers are encouraged to submit additional
evidence along with affidavits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, OSM will not modify the proposed regulation to delete the use of affidavits or to require that affidavits
only be allowed as proof if accompanied by other supporting evidence in every case. Also, while OSM agrees that State
corporation commissions may be a good source of relevant ownership or control information, OSM declines to adopt
a ``best evidence'' test which would prevent the submission of affidavits when documents have been filed with State
corporation commissions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter representing environmental advocacy groups criticized paragraph (c)(2)(i)(D) of proposed &sect;773.26
insofar as the provisions allowed for the submission of an opinion of counsel in support of a challenge with respect
to an ownership or control link or with respect to the status of a violation. In substance, the commenter asserted that
such opinions present no factual evidence for the regulatory authority. Such opinions of counsel represent legal
opinions with respect to ownership or control and invade the province of the decisionmaker, the regulatory authority.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM agrees that an opinion of counsel should not, in itself, be considered ``evidence.'' Indeed, opinions of counsel
constitute legal analysis based upon factual information. Both proposed and final regulations require that such
opinions ``be supported by evidentiary materials.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nevertheless, OSM must disagree that such opinions should be excluded. By providing an opportunity for the submission
of such opinions, OSM is seeking to encourage counsel to conduct a diligent investigation of the facts and to assist
regulatory authorities by presenting the fruits of such investigation_the factual materials_along with counsel's
legal opinions as to the import of such evidence. The decision as to the weight to be given to the evidentiary materials
and the persuasiveness of the counsel's opinions remain with the regulatory authority considering the challenge
to the ownership or control link. Lawyers routinely argue their clients' positions to triers of fact and law. Such
argument does not invade the province of the decisionmaker which retains the authority to make the decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM has decided to allow for a challenger's submission of an opinion of counsel in support of his or her position as part
of final &sect;773.25. Such opinion would be appropriate for submission when it is supported by evidentiary materials;
when it is rendered by an attorney who certifies that he or she is qualified to render an opinion of law; and when counsel
states that he or she has personally and diligently investigated the facts of the matter or where counsel states that
such opinion is based upon information which has been supplied to counsel and which is assumed to be true.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whereas the proposed rule only provided for such opinion when counsel made a personal investigation of the facts,
the final rule incorporates language to provide for opinions where such investigation has not been made. The basis
for this change is to reflect that, under certain circumstances, attorneys might not choose to conduct a complete
personal investigation of the factual representations made within the opinion. See Formal Opinion 346 (Revised),
Tax Law Opinions in Tax Shelter Investment Offerings, Standing Committee on Ethics and Professional Responsibility,
American Bar Association (January 29, 1982).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such opinion is similar in type to that provided by counsel to an adversary party as to title, tax issues, or environmental
compliance in real estate transactions. The indicator of reliability in this document is that the attorney is offering
his or her opinion subject to professional standards provided by national and local bar associations and possible
sanctions for the violations of such standards which may be imposed by applicable rules of conduct governing attorneys.
In addition, under the final regulation, the attorney's opinion by itself is not enough to challenge an ownership
or control link. Evidentiary materials need to be submitted along with such opinion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the substantive change noted above, OSM has made non-substantive changes to the provision which clarify
the requirements of the final rule provision. Accordingly, OSM has adopted the proposed rule with the changes noted
as paragraph (c)(2)(i)(D) of final &sect;773.25.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As described above, paragraph (d) of proposed &sect;773.26, required proof for the rebuttal of ownership or control
presumptions, represented OSM's attempt to offer substantive standards which would have established what must
be proved by those seeking to rebut the presumptions of ownership or control contained in current &sect;773.5(b)
of this title. Proof of the type of facts set forth in the proposed regulations would have established that the presumed
owner or controller did not, in fact, have the authority directly or indirectly to determine the manner in which the
relevant surface coal mining operation was conducted, under the provisions of 30 CFR 773.5(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM has determined not to go forward with paragraph (d) of proposed &sect;773.26 and has, therefore, withdrawn that
portion of the proposed rule. In substance, OSM believes that ownership and control determinations are inherently
a case specific process. Each ownership or control matter turns on the totality of circumstances in a given case and
whether the evidence presented demonstrates that the presumed owner or controller does not or did not, in fact, have
the authority directly or indirectly to determine the manner in which the relevant surface coal mining operation
was conducted. See 30 CFR 773.5(b)(1). The pragmatic focus of such an inquiry will continue to be whether a presumed
controller actually exercised control over an entity or had the substantive power to exercise control over an entity,
even if he or she chose not to actually exercise such power. As OSM has stated previously in the preamble to 30 CFR &sect;773.5(b),
``To the extent that a coal company 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
controls or can exercise control over a contract operator, it should be held responsible
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for any outstanding violations of the Act which it should have prevented or corrected.'' (Emphasis added.) See Preamble
to Requirements for Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Permit Approval; Ownership and Control; Final Rule, 53 FR
38868 at page 38877 (October 3, 1988). In effect, a person challenging a presumption of control must demonstrate,
by a preponderance of the evidence, that neither of these two circumstances is applicable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While it might be initially attractive for the agency to create a standard containing three or four elements, the proof
of which automatically rebuts a presumption, OSM is unwilling to impose such potentially rigid substantive tests
upon the process of analyzing ownership or control cases. OSM believes that such rigid standards do not serve the interests
of the States, industry, or OSM, because they might be taken to preclude consideration of other rebuttal evidence
not listed or, conversely, might force a State regulatory authority to accept a rebuttal which conforms substantially
to OSM's model but which, in the opinion of the regulatory authority, does not in fact rebut the presumption. OSM's
experience has taught that each ownership or control rebuttal requires an analysis of the presumed relationship
within the complete factual context.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, in analyzing the ownership or control profile of an entity, OSM will look to the totality of circumstances_with
the view to understanding how a particular entity operates and operated_to determine the true owners or controllers
of a surface coal mining operation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters representing environmental advocacy groups asserted that the rules should provide that any documents
submitted by persons challenging presumptions of ownership or control be considered part of the public record and
part of the permit file. On the other hand, industry commenters argued that the rules are deficient because they do
not contain a provision by which documentation submitted could be held confidential. They further asserted that
there was no means for a challenger to obtain a protective order with respect to confidential materials submitted
in support of a challenge.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM agrees that documents submitted in support of a challenge to an ownership or control link or in support of a challenge
to the status or the existence of a violation should normally be considered part of the public record. The public has
a legitimate interest in knowing and understanding the basis for a regulatory authority's decisions in these matters.
In a democracy, it is unreasonable for a governmental agency to make such decisions based upon secret information.
Further, the credibility of the regulatory authority and the integrity of its decisionmaking process require that
its decisions be supported by an adequate record.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the same time, OSM also recognizes that there may be valid competitive reasons why industry operators believe that
certain information needs to be kept confidential. For instance, a person may not wish to reveal the price which he
or she has paid for the coal extracted by a mine contractor for fear that other contractors or competitors will learn
of this information and change their prices or bids to the disadvantage of the person revealing the information. A
person concerned about such disclosure may be reluctant to submit a copy of the relevant contract because it contains
the agreed price. OSM disagrees, however, that these industry concerns require special provisions in the rules to
seal documents or to otherwise protect confidentiality.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In balancing the concerns of the public and the coal industry with respect to public access to the submitted documents,
OSM will be guided by the principles of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552 (FOIA), and the Departmental regulations
implementing FOIA. See 43 CFR 2.11&hyph;2.22. Upon request by a member of the public, OSM will ordinarily make available
to the requestor documents provided by challengers of ownership or control links, the status of violations, and the
existence of violations. To the extent that a person submitting information to OSM asserts that the materials should
be kept confidential, OSM will evaluate that request in accordance with the applicable provisions of FOIA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the above analysis, OSM has determined that the interests of the commenters can be addressed under
current law and that the rule does not need to be modified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the above discussion, OSM has determined to adopt a final version of the proposed rule. The final
rule has been renumbered as &sect;773.25 to reflect the withdrawal of proposed &sect;773.25, procedures for challenging
ownership or control links prior to entry in AVS. As indicated above, OSM has modified the provisions of the proposal
to allow for the submission of an opinion of counsel based upon evidence developed through counsel's personal investigation
or based upon facts which have been supplied to counsel in support of a challenge of an ownership or control presumption.
As further discussed above, OSM has inserted language in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) to clarify that a permittee may challenge
the existence of the violation at the time it was cited within the context of improvident permit issuance as provided
by &sect;&sect;773.20 and 773.21. OSM has also withdrawn paragraph (d) of the proposed rule, required proof for the
rebuttal of ownership or control presumptions, described above. The final rule contains no other substantive changes
from proposed rule &sect;773.26. The final rule contains certain other non-substantive modifications as described
below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a) of final &sect;773.25 provides that provisions of &sect;773.25 are applicable to any challenge concerning
an ownership or control link or the status of a violation when such challenge is made under the provisions of 30 CFR 773.20
and 30 CFR 773.21 (improvidently issued permits); &sect;&sect;773.23 (the regulatory authority's review of ownership
or control and violation information), and 773.24 (procedures for challenging ownership or control links shown
in AVS); or under 30 CFR part 775 (administrative and judicial review of permitting decisions).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a) of the final rule differs from the proposed rule in that references to proposed &sect;773.25, procedures
for challenging ownership or control links prior to entry in AVS, have been deleted. A further change in this paragraph
from the proposed rule provides that the provisions of final &sect;773.25 apply to challenges of an ownership or control
``link to any person'' rather than only to a ``link to any person in a violation notice.'' The purpose of this change
is to clarify that the provisions of the section apply to challenges of ownership or control links including those
which do not generate a current link to an outstanding violation. OSM's experience has demonstrated that members
of the regulated community have, in many cases, sought proactively to challenge ownership or control links to other
persons, without regard to whether there were outstanding violations. Such challenges have been asserted, among
other reasons, to avoid the risk of being linked to future violations through such ownership or control relationships.
OSM recognizes that this is a legitimate concern. Accordingly, the change in the final rule allows the challenge of
ownership or control links without regard to whether there are outstanding violations.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (a)(2) of final &sect;773.25 contains a further change from the proposed rule in that the regulation provides
that the provisions of the rule apply to challenges of ``the status of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
any
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 violation covered by 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice.'' (Emphasis added.) The comparable section of the proposed regulation provided that the regulation applied
to the status of ``the violation covered by such notice.'' The purpose of the change is to recognize that there may be
multiple violations, rather than a single violation, to which a person is linked through ownership or control. A person
may wish to challenge the status of each of these violations, rather than only the violation contained in a single notice.
If so, the provisions of final &sect;773.25 apply to such challenges. Consistent with this change, ``such notice''
is changed to ``a notice.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) of final &sect;773.25 provides the basic allocation of responsibility among regulatory authorities
to make decisions with respect to ownership or control and with respect to the status of violations. State regulatory
authorities are expected to have procedures in place to address challenges made in accordance with these rules, including
in situations where there are ongoing State proceedings in other jurisdictions on permit applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b)(1)(i) if final &sect;773.25 provides that the regulatory authority before which an application is
pending has ``responsibility'' for making decisions with respect to the ``ownership or control relationships of
the application.'' This represents a change of terminology from the comparable provision of the proposed rule which
provided that the regulatory authority would have ``authority for making decisions with respect to the ownership
or control of the applicant.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, the use of the word ``responsibility,'' rather than ``authority,'' more accurately describes the regulatory
authority's mandate under this regulation. ``Responsibility'' encompasses both authority, the power to act, and
the obligation to act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, paragraph (b)(1)(i) of final &sect;773.25 speaks of ``ownership or control relationships of the application,''
rather than of the ``ownership or control of the applicant,'' as provided in the proposed rule. This change clarifies
that the regulatory authority before which an application is pending will evaluate and make decisions with respect
to the ownership and control issues with respect to an entire application, rather than just the particular applicant,
consistent with this regulatory authority's primary responsibility for the application. This regulatory authority
has responsibility for revising ownership or control information submitted as part of the permit application and
other available information to ensure the complete identification of ownership or control relationships relevant
to the decision to be made with respect to the application. The word ``relationships'' has been added to the regulation
because it better explains the focus of this process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of final &sect;773.25 provides that the regulatory authority that issued a permit has responsibility
for making decisions with respect to the ownership or control relationships of the permit. The regulatory authority
which issued a permit would have done so based upon a complete review of ownership or control information as required
by the regulations. In the event that the improvidently issued permit regulations of 30 CFR 773.20 and 773.21 are invoked,
this regulatory authority will have to decide whether such permit has been improvidently issued and whether, if the
basis for such improvident issuance was an ownership or control link to a violator, whether such improvident issuance
has been remedied. Accordingly, that regulatory authority must make decisions with respect to ownership or control
relationships incident to the permit.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of final &sect;773.25, ``responsibility'' has replaced the word ``authority'' contained
in the proposed rule. The reasoning provided with respect to the changes made to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of the final rule
is applicable here. Again, the regulatory authority will be making decisions ``with respect to the ownership or control
relationships of the permit, ``rather than with respect to the ownership or control of the permittee,'' as provided
in the proposed rule. This reflects that regulatory authority's primary responsibility for the permit which it has
issued.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of final &sect;773.25 provides that the State regulatory authority that issued a State violation
notice has responsibility for making decisions with respect to the ownership or control relationships of the violation.
The State regulatory authority issuing the violation is in the best position to be aware, in the first instance, of
operative facts which identify those owners or controllers who have the ``authority directly or indirectly to determine
the manner in which the relevant surface coal mining operation is conducted'' and who can thus cause the abatement
of the violation. See 30 CFR 773.5(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of final &sect;773.25, ``responsibility'' has replaced the word ``authority'' contained
in the proposed rule. The reasoning provided with respect to these changes in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of the final rule
is applicable here. Again, the regulatory authority will be making decisions ``with respect to the ownership or control
relationships of the violation,'' rather than ``with respect to the ownership or control of any person cited in such
notice [of violation],'' as provided in the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of the final &sect;773.25 provides that the regulatory authority that issued a violation notice,
whether State or Federal, would have responsibility for making decisions concerning the status of the violation
covered by the notice. As in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of the final rule, ``responsibility'' has replaced the word ``authority''
previously contained in the proposed rule. The reasoning provided with respect to the similar change in paragraph
(b)(1)(i) of this final rule is applicable here.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As in the proposed rule, the ``status'' of the violation means whether the violation remains outstanding, has been
corrected, is in the process of being corrected, or is the subject of a good faith appeal, within the meaning of 30 CFR
773.15(b)(1). This approach is consistent with the provisions of section 510(c) of SMCRA which require that a regulatory
authority considering a permit application look to the ``agency that has jurisdiction over such violation'' to determine
whether a violation ``has been or is in the process of being corrected.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b)(2) of final &sect;773.25 provides that OSM has responsibility for making decisions with respect to
the ownership or control relationships of a Federal violation notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of final &sect;773.25, ``responsibility'' has replaced the word ``authority'' contained
in the proposed rule. The reasoning provided with respect to this change in paragraph (b)(1)(i) is applicable here.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b)(2) of final &sect;773.25 is essentially a Federal counterpart to paragraph (b)(1)(iii) and the same
basic rationale applies here, as well. This provision differs from (b)(1)(iii), however, in that OSM's authority
to decide the ownership and control relationships of a Federal violation notice is not initial responsibility as
the State's responsibility is in (b)(1)(iii). Instead, OSM's responsibility is final.This difference recognizes
that State regulatory authorities are subject to oversight by OSM. OSM is not subject to similar oversight by the States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the allocation principles set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of final &sect;773.25, a regulatory authority
deciding whether a permit application should be granted or whether a permit has been improvidently issued determines
for itself the ownership or control relationships of the application or permit, but it defers to the regulatory authority
that issued a violation notice for a determination of the ownership or control relationships of the violation. The
application is then denied or the permit subject to treatment under the regulations governing improvident issuance
if any owner or controller of the applicant or permittee is also an owner or controller of a violator, as determined
by the respective regulatory authorities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b)(3)(i) of final &sect;773.25 provides that with respect to information shown on AVS, the responsibility
of State regulatory authorities to make decisions concerning ownership or control links will be subject to the plenary
authority of OSM. This represents a change from the comparable provision of the proposed rule which provided that
the authority of regulatory authorities to make ownership or control decisions with respect to applicants, permittees,
and persons cited in violation notices and decisions with respect to the status of violations would be subject to OSM's
review as an element of State program oversight under parts 733, 842, and 843.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rationale for this change is simply that OSM is ultimately responsible for the maintenance and content of the AVS
with respect to ownership or control information. OSM believes that the quality of ownership or control information
is the core of AVS. OSM must closely monitor such information to maintain the accuracy of such information and the integrity
of AVS. The need to protect the integrity of the AVS dictates that OSM have the ability to review the underlying basis
supporting any ownership or control link shown on the system and to change information with respect to any ownership
or control link or all such links, if necessary. Accordingly, the final rule provides that OSM's authority will be
plenary with respect to ownership or control information shown on AVS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, once ownership or control information is entered into AVS, OSM will assume control of such data. If OSM reviews
such information and concludes that it is incorrect, OSM will act to correct such ownership or control information
and incorporate such corrected information into AVS. OSM intends to coordinate any such changes with the regulatory
authority responsible for initial entry of the data in question.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of final &sect;773.25, with respect to information shown on AVS relating to the status
of a violation and with respect to ownership or control information which has not been entered into AVS by a State, the
authority of a State regulatory authority will be subject to OSM's program oversight authority under 30 CFR parts
733, 842, and 843. OSM relies primarily upon the States to determine whether State violations have been abated or not.
SMCRA section 510(c) explicitly states that an applicant must demonstrate that any current violation ``has been
corrected or is in the process of being corrected to the satisfaction of the regulatory authority, department, or
agency which has jurisdiction over such violation *&blank;*&blank;*'' See also 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, where State ownership or control information has not yet become part of AVS, the information has not yet entered
the Federal information stream and has not yet become OSM's immediate responsibility. Such information is, in effect,
still the primary responsibility of the State regulatory authority and potentially subject to correction through
procedures of the State regulatory program. If correct information fails to enter the AVS, that may represent a weakness
of the regulatory authority's decisionmaking process. Accordingly, that process may require review. With respect
to the State's decisionmaking process, principles of primacy require that OSM review State actions in these matters
in accordance with OSM's program oversight under parts 733, 842, and 843. In the exercise of program oversight however,
it is also probable that OSM would review particular decisions with a view to determining whether the State regulatory
authority complied with the provisions of its approved program. Accordingly, in the event that a State determines
not to enter an ownership or control link into AVS, OSM will review such decision when it has reason to believe, through
information provided in a citizen's complaint or otherwise, that the State's ownership or control decision is arbitrary,
capricious, or an abuse of discretion under the State program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In final &sect;773.25, OSM has deleted language contained in the proposed rule which would have provided that when
OSM disagreed with the decisions of State regulatory authorities, OSM would take action, as appropriate, under &sect;843.24,
oversight of State permitting decisions with respect to ownership or control or the status of violations. This language
has been deleted for two reasons. First, the proposed language was redundant. Paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of final &sect;773.25
already provides that State regulatory authorities' decisions are subject to OSM's oversight under parts 733, 842,
and 843 of 30 CFR. As a section of part 843, the provisions of final &sect;843.24 would thus be applicable under appropriate
circumstances. Further, the agency was concerned that additional language specifically requiring OSM to take action
under final &sect;843.24 could somehow be construed as a limiting factor on OSM's authority to take action under parts
733 or 842 or under other sections of part 843 as provided by previous paragraph (b)(3)(ii) or 773.25.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) of final &sect;773.25 establishes evidentiary standards applicable to the formal and informal review
of ownership or control links and the status of violations. The provisions of the final section are substantively
similar to the provisions of the comparable provisions of the proposed rule. Certain minor changes described below
have been made to the proposal.

Paragraph (c)(1) of final &sect;773.25 provides that in any formal or informal review of an ownership or control link
or of the status of a violation covered by a violation notice, the agency responsible for making a decision is required
to first make a prima facie determination or showing that the link exists, existed during the relevant period, and/or
that the violation remains outstanding. The language ``existed during the relevant period'' has been added to the
final rule to clarify that, even when a person is not a current owner or controller of a surface coal mining operation,
a previous ownership or control link to that operation may be the basis for permit denial where the surface coal mining
operation has an outstanding violation and that violation had its inception during the previous period of ownership
or control. The requirement of a prima facie determination or prima facie showing is satisfied by evidence presented
establishing a presumption of ownership or control. A prima facie determination is made when the agency is reviewing
the evidence itself, in an informal process; a prima facie showing is made when the agency's determination is the subject
of a formal administrative or judicial review process. When the agency makes such a determination or showing, the
person seeking to challenge the link or the status of the violation than has the burden of proving the necessary elements
of his or her challenge to the link or to the status of the violation by a preponderance of the evidence.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Also, in the comparable provision of the proposed rule, the rule language referred to the evidentiary standards applicable
to the review of ownership or control links ``to a person cited in a violation notice.'' The final rule has been changed
to reflect that these standards will be applicable to the review of an ownership or control link, without regard to
whether such relationship involves a link to an outstanding violation. The rationale for such a change has been explained
previously in this preamble in the discussion of a similar change made in paragraph (a)(1) of this final rule section.
As in the proposed rule, where there is a link to a violation, these evidentiary standards will apply to the review of
the status of a violation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(1) of final &sect;773.25, requires a challenger of an ownership or control link to prove at least one
of three proposed conclusions by a preponderance of the evidence to succeed in his or her challenge.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of final &sect;773.25, a challenger can demonstrate that the facts relied upon by the responsible
agency to prove ownership or control under the definitions of ``owned or controlled'' or ``owns or controls'' contained
in 30 CFR 773.5 do not or did not exist. The final regulation differs from the comparable provision of the proposed regulation
in that while the final regulation refers to 30 CFR 773.5, it does not specifically cite particular paragraphs of 30
CFR 773.5 defining presumed and deemed relationships of ownership or control. On June 28, 1993, OSM proposed rules
which, if adopted, would modify the organization of regulatory language in 30 CFR 773.5. See Proposed Rule, 58 Fed.
Reg. 34652 (June 28, 1993). By changing the language in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of final &sect;773.25 to delete references
to the current paragraph organization of 30 CFR 773.5, OSM retains the flexibility to adopt or reject its rule proposal
of June 28, 1993, without having to further modify final &sect;773.25.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of final &sect;773.25 provides that a person challenging a presumption of ownership or control
can prove that the person subject to the presumption does not and did not have authority directly or indirectly to determine
the manner in which surface coal mining operations were conducted. The final rule deletes a reference contained in
the proposed rule to the paragraph (d) of the proposed rule which provided the required proof for the rebuttal of ownership
or control presumptions. As indicated above, that portion of the proposed rule has been withdrawn.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of final &sect;773.25 provides that a challenger can prove that the violation covered by a
violation notice did not exist, has been corrected, is in the process of being corrected, or is the subject of a good
faith appeal within the meaning of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). The final rule provides that a person challenging the status
of a violation under &sect;773.24 will not be able to challenge the existence of the violation at the time it was cited
unless such challenge is made by a permittee within the context of &sect;&sect;773.20&hyph;773.21 of this part.
As indicated previously, the proposed rule did not explicitly allow challenge of the existence of the violation by
a permittee within the context of improvident permit issuance. The proposed rule also did not include the words ``at
the time it was cited'' with respect to the concept ``existence of the violation.'' The final rule has provided such
clarification. Also, references to proposed &sect;773.25, procedures for challenging ownership or control links
prior to entry in AVS, have been deleted. In addition, while no further substantive change has been made to the text
of paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of final &sect;773.25, some editing has been done to clarify the parallel construction
of the regulatory text.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the provisions of final &sect;773.25, the existence of the violation at the time it was cited could also be challenged
in a proceeding under 30 CFR part 775 (involving administrative or judicial appeals of permitting decisions), unless
the challenger has failed to take timely advantage of a prior opportunity to litigate the violation or is bound by a
previous administrative or judicial determination concerning the existence of the violation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, certain minimal changes have been made to the proposed rule with respect to the submission of documents
in the proof of challenges. Paragraphs (c)(2)(i)(B) and (c)(2)(i)(C) of proposed &sect;773.26 provided that certified
copies of corporate documents and certified copies of documents filed with or issued by State, Municipal, or Federal
government agencies could be submitted. Paragraphs (c)(2)(i)(B) and (c)(2)(i)(C) of final &sect;773.25 clarify
that copies of such documents can be submitted only ``if certified.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(2)(i)(D) of final &sect;773.25 provides for a challenger's submission of an opinion of counsel in
support of his or her position. Such opinion would be appropriate for submission when it is supported by evidentiary
materials; when it is rendered by an attorney who certifies that he or she is qualified to render an opinion of law; and
when counsel states that he or she has personally and diligently investigated the facts of the matter or where counsel
states that such opinion is based upon information which has been supplied to counsel and which is assumed to be true.

. In the September, 1991 proposed rule package, OSM proposed this section which would have required that the regulatory
authority engage in periodic review of a permitted site to assure that basic ownership and control information contained
in the current official record of the permit was and remains complete and accurate. Subsequent to the publication
of that proposal, OSM published a modified version of such proposal as part of a comprehensive rule proposal designed
to address permit information requirements; ownership or control; and the transfer, assignment and sale of permit
rights. See 58 FR 34652, 34666 (June 28, 1993). OSM intends to address the proposed rule within the context of the subsequent
rulemaking. Accordingly, OSM defers any decision with respect to this proposed rule.

 In the September, 1991 proposal, OSM proposed to revise the provisions of paragraphs (c) and (d) of then current 30
CFR 778.13 to clarify that permit applicants would be required to disclose relevant information with respect to both
``deemed'' and ``presumed'' owners or controllers within the meaning of the definitions of ``owned or controlled''
and ``owns or controls'' under 30 CFR 773.5 (a) and (b), respectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent to the publication of that proposal, OSM published a new proposed amendment to 30 CFR 778.13 as part of the
comprehensive rule proposal cited above which was designed to address permit information requirements; ownership
or control; and the transfer, assignment and sale of permit rights. See 58 FR 34652, 34668 (June 28, 1993). Accordingly,
OSM hereby defers any decision with respect to the amendments proposed to 30 CFR 778.13 in today's rulemaking. Instead,
OSM will address proposed amendments to 30 CFR 778.13 within the context of that subsequent proposal.

Section 778.14_Violation information.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed amendment would have provided that the introductory language in paragraph (c) of 30 CFR 778.14 be amended
to require a permit applicant to disclose all violation notices received by the applicant within the preceding three
years. In addition, such introductory language would have been amended to require the disclosure of all outstanding
violation notices for any surface coal mining operation that is deemed or presumed to be owned or controlled by either
the applicant or by any person who is deemed or presumed to own or control the applicant under definitions of ``owned
or controlled'' or ``owns or controls'' under 30 CFR 773.5.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulation to be amended required the applicant to disclose violations of various laws listed in 30 CFR 778.14(c).
Use of the proposed amended definition of ``violation notice'' from 30 CFR 773.5 would have obviated the need for such
a list.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulation to be amended further required that the applicant provide only a list of unabated cessation orders
and unabated air and water quality violation notices received prior to the date of the application by any surface coal
mining and reclamation operation owned or controlled by either the applicant or by any person who owns or controls
the applicant. With respect to this second list, that regulation did not require that an applicant list notices of
violation received or unpaid penalties or fees incurred by any surface coal mining operation owned or controlled
by the applicant or by any person who owns or controls the applicant.

Moreover, in litigation relating to &sect;&sect;778.14, 773.15(b)(1), and related matters before the U.S. District
Court of the District of Columbia, the Secretary advised the court that he had decided to reconsider &sect;778.14(c).
The Secretary stated that he intended to propose a regulation ``which considers the extent to which violation information
should be reported concerning owners and controllers of applicants as well as entities owned or controlled by the
applicant.'' See

Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment and in Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motions for Summary Judgment, footnote 33, at
page 90.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with the representation made to the court, the proposed amendment to paragraph (c) of &sect;778.14 would
have required an applicant to disclose all outstanding violation notices received by any surface coal mining operation
that was deemed or presumed to be owned or controlled by either the applicant or any person who was deemed or presumed
to own or control the applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters representing members of the coal industry expressed concern over the proposed amendment to 30 CFR 778.14(c)
for essentially three reasons. They asserted that the proposed amendment impermissibly expanded the types of violations
which must be reported by an applicant by incorporating the newly amended definition of ``violation notice'' as the
basis for reporting; that the proposal inappropriately expanded the definition of ``owners or controllers'' which
must be reported; and that the proposal inappropriately expanded the type of information required for operations
linked through ownership or control.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM disagrees with the commenters' assertions. First, the proposed regulation does incorporate the new definition
of the term ``violation notice'' which had been proposed, and has now been adopted, in &sect;773.5. The new definition
of violation notice, however, is not overly broad. In this preamble, OSM has already responded to similar comments
made with respect to this definition in the section of this preamble captioned ``Section 773.5_Definitions.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By incorporating the amended definition of ``violation notice,'' the proposed amendment to paragraph (c) of &sect;778.14
would have incorporated the list and types of violations which are relevant to a regulatory authority's decision
whether to issue a permit under section 510(c) of the Act and under the provisions of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). In contrast
to this, the unamended version of the regulation did not require that an applicant list unpaid penalties or fees incurred
by any surface coal mining operation owned or controlled by the applicant or by any person who owns or controls the applicant.
Accordingly, the proposed amendment would expand what has to be reported to enable the regulatory authority to have
necessary information to make its decision. It is entirely appropriate to require that a permit applicant report
such information to the regulatory authority so that the regulatory authority can make an informed decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated above, commenters further asserted that the proposal inappropriately expanded the definition of ``owners
or controllers'' by requiring the reporting of all outstanding violations received prior to the date of permit applications
by surface coal mining operations deemed or presumed to be owned or controlled by the applicant or by any person who
owns or controls the applicant. The commenters asserted that this placed the applicant in an untenable position.
OSM disagrees with this assertion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even if 30 CFR 778.14(c) would not be amended by the proposal, the regulation already required the reporting of violations
of surface coal mining operations which the applicant is deemed or presumed to own or control under the provisions
of 30 CFR 773.5. Such reporting is required even if the applicant believes that he or she can rebut the presumption of
ownership or control. The permit application is not forced to admit ownership or control. On the contrary, such reporting
can be done by an applicant who, at the same time, reserves his or her rights to deny ownership or control. Even under
current law, the applicant must disclose violations incident to the presumed ownership or control relationship
so that the regulatory authority can evaluate this information. Thus, the amendment would just clarify what the regulation
already does. Therefore, the amendment has not inappropriately expanded the definition of what constitutes surface
coal mining operations owned or controlled by the applicant.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters further asserted that the proposal inappropriately expanded the type of information required for operations
linked through ownership or control. In substance, the commenters argued that the proposed regulation is overbroad
and vague in requiring the reporting of ``all outstanding violation notices'' received prior to the date of application
which are linked, through ownership or control, to the applicant. Again, OSM disagrees with the commenters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed previously in this preamble with respect to &sect;773.25 of the final rule, an ``outstanding violation''
is one which is currently in violation of the Act or of other laws specified in &sect;510(c) of the Act. Under the proposed
amendment to 30 CFR 778.14(d), an ``outstanding violation notice'' is a written notification from a governmental
entity advising of a violation which remains uncorrected. Such violations are the basis for permit denial unless
an applicant can demonstrate that the violation is in the process of being corrected or is the subject of a good faith
appeal, within the meaning of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). It is reasonable to require, prior to the date of application, that
a permit applicant disclose such violations to the regulatory authority with respect to surface coal mining operations
to which it is linked through ownership or control.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that the proposed amendment should be modified to require only the reporting of violations
which would subject an applicant to permit block. OSM considers this proposal to be too restrictive. For instance,
under commenter's proposal, an applicant correcting a violation to the satisfaction of the agency which has jurisdiction
over such violation would not report such violation at the time of application. Nevertheless, any permit to be issued
should be conditioned upon the performance of the corrective work being accomplished. Absent the reporting of such
violation by the applicant, a regulatory authority might overlook the violation and issue the permit unconditioned
upon such performance. The same rationale would apply with respect to the reporting of violations which are the subject
of good faith appeal, within the meaning of 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). Accordingly, OSM must reject the proposed change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, commenters asserted that requiring such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disclosure by large companies with multiple affiliates and multiple surface coal mining operations is overly burdensome.
OSM believes that companies which own or control surface coal mining operations should be aware of the compliance
status of such operations. If companies choose to engage in surface coal mining operations, they should also have
the capability of monitoring such operations. It is reasonable to require the disclosure of outstanding violations.
Thus, OSM disagrees with the commenters' assertion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nevertheless, OSM intends to further address the issues of compliance under 30 CFR 778.13 and 778.14. In a recently
proposed rule package of June 28, 1993, OSM proposed the streamlining of companies' reporting under 30 CFR 778.13
and 778.14 through the use of information already incorporated into AVS. See 58 FR 34652 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (June 28, 1993). Further, OSM's AVS Office stands ready to work with companies in the development of methods to report
such companies' ownership or control relationships and to track the compliance of surface coal mining operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated previously in the preamble discussion of final section 773.15, OSM has decided to retain a limited presumption
that notices of violation are in the process of being abated for purposes of a regulatory authority's review of a permit
application. OSM made this decision as result of comments received in response to its proposed rules. Accordingly,
OSM has amended paragraph (b)(1) of final &sect;773.15 to provide that a regulatory authority may presume, in the
absence of a cessation order, that a notice of violation is in the process of abatement if certain conditions are present.
These conditions include that the abatement period for the notice of violation has not yet expired and that the applicant
has provided certification that such violation is in the process of being corrected to the agency with jurisdiction
over the violation as part of the violation information provided pursuant to &sect;778.14. In accordance with that
change made to final &sect;773.15, OSM has added language to paragraph (c) of final &sect;778.14 requiring that an
applicant provide such certification along with his or her disclosure of violations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the September, 1991, proposal, OSM proposed to amend the Table of Contents of 30 CFR part 843 to add, in numerical
order, the proposed regulations for the Federal enforcement of the proposed AVS-related regulations. The proposed
additions would have included &sect;843.23, sanctions for knowing omissions or inaccuracies in ownership or control
and violation information, and &sect;843.24, oversight of State permitting decisions with respect to ownership
or control of the status of violations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent to the publication of the proposed additions to the Table of Contents, OSM proposed a modified version
of 843.23 as part of a separate rulemaking. See Proposed Rule, 58 FR 34652 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (June 28, 1993). OSM has deferred action on the adoption of proposed &sect;843.23 for that later rulemaking. Since
action on proposed &sect;843.23 has been deferred, OSM will not adopt a reference to &sect;843.23 for inclusion in
the Table of Contents at this time. If a final version of 843.23 is adopted, a reference to the section will be added to
the Table of Contents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 The September, 1991, proposal would have removed existing section 843.10 since part 843 did not contain any information
collection requirements which required the approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507.
The references to &sect;843.14(c) and 843.16 in existing 843.10 did not represent information collection requirements.
The requirements in &sect;843.14(c) for OSM to furnish copies of notices and orders to the State regulatory authority
and to any person having an interest did not require OMB approval because the obligation to provide the information
was imposed upon OSM and not upon the State or upon a member of the public. Section 843.16 merely informed the public
of the right to file an application for review and request a hearing under 43 CFR part 4.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Proposed &sect;843.23 was designed to respond to those circumstances in which there had been a knowing failure to
provide the regulatory authority with complete and accurate ownership and control or violation information in an
application or other document submitted pursuant to parts 773 and 778 of Title 30.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;843.23 was designed ``to carry out the purposes'' of sections 507(b)(4), 510(b), 510(c), and 518(g)
of SMCRA. The proposed section was designed to deter and punish the intentional failure to provide the complete and
accurate ownership and control information required by sections 507(b)(4) and 510 (b)&hyph;(c) of the Act. It would
have further implemented the criminal provisions of section 518(g) where appropriate.

As has been discussed previously in this preamble, OSM has allowed references to &sect;843.23 to remain in various
sections of some of the other final rules adopted today in the event that a final &sect;843.23 is adopted. That such
references have been allowed to remain, however, does not constitute a prejudgment by OSM to ultimately adopt proposed
&sect;843.23 or some version of that rule. Any decision of this type will be made within the context of the subsequent
rulemaking.

Section 843.24_Oversight of State permitting decisions with respect to ownership or control or the status of violations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;843.24 would have provided standards for OSM's oversight of State permitting decisions with respect
to ownership or control or the status of violations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a) of proposed &sect;843.24 would have established the bases which would have required OSM to have taken
action under the provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of proposed &sect;843.24.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a)(1) of proposed &sect;843.24 would have provided that OSM would have been required to take action whenever
it determined, through its oversight of the implementation of State programs, that a State had issued a permit without
complying with the State program equivalents of proposed &sect;&sect;773.22 (verification of ownership or control
application information), 773.23 (review of ownership or control and violation information), 773.24 (procedures
for challenging ownership or control links in AVS), 773.26 (standards for challenging ownership or control links
and the status of violations), and 843.23 (sanctions for knowing omissions or inaccuracies in ownership or control
and violation information).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a)(2) of proposed &sect;843.24 would have provided that OSM would have been required to take action whenever
it had determined, through its oversight of the implementation of State programs, that a State had failed in a systemic
manner to comply with the State program equivalent of proposed &sect;773.27 (periodic check of ownership or control
information).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a)(2) of proposed &sect;843.24 would have defined ``failure to comply in a systemic manner'' to include
a continuing pattern of noncompliance by a State, or one of more instances of noncompliance that result from or evidence
a legal or policy decision which the State intended to apply to similar cases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under paragraph (a) of proposed &sect;843.24, a State's isolated failure to comply with proposed &sect;773.27 (periodic
check of ownership and control information) would have been treated differently from isolated failures to comply
with the proposed regulations listed in paragraph (a)(1) of proposed &sect;843.24.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) of proposed &sect;843.24 would have required OSM to initiate action under 30 CFR 843.21 if, as a result
of the determination made under paragraph (a) of the proposed section, OSM had reason to believe that the State had
issued a permit improvidently within the meaning of 30 CFR 773.20.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) of proposed &sect;843.24 would have provided for remedial actions by OSM against a State which did not
comply with the proposed regulations relating to ownership or control and violation information during the permit
application process. Such actions would have been applied where the State had knowingly failed to comply with the
State program equivalents of sections 773.22 (verification of ownership or control application information),
773.23 (review of ownership or control and violation information), 773.24 (procedures for challenging ownership
or control links in AVS), 773.26 (standards for challenging ownership or control links and the status of violations),
or 843.23 (sanctions for knowing omissions or inaccuracies in ownership or control and violation information),
or where the State had failed in a systemic manner to comply with &sect;773.27 (periodic check of ownership and control
information).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposed regulation, the remedial actions against a non-complying State could have included grant reduction
or termination under 30 CFR 735.21 or 30 CFR 886.18 and the substitution of Federal enforcement or other action pursuant
to 30 CFR 733.12(b). Such remedial actions would not have been used where the State's actions were mandated by court
order or where the State had not knowingly failed to comply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter representing environmental advocacy groups expressed concern that proposed &sect;843.24 did not expressly
provide that citizens could petition OSM to take enforcement action where they had reason to believe that violations
of the sections subject to &sect;843.24 exist. OSM recognizes commenter's concern about citizen participation
and has addressed that issue in some detail above in this preamble in the section captioned ``Citizen Participation.''
The analysis in that section of the preamble is generally applicable to proposed &sect;843.24. For reasons similar
to those expressed in that section of the preamble, OSM must reject commenter's proposal to explicitly modify the
proposed rule at this time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Until these matters are addressed directly by further proposal of the agency, citizens could, however, assert their
rights in a number of ways in accordance with the provisions of proposed &sect;843.24. With respect to specific permits
under paragraph (b) of proposed &sect;843.24, concerned citizens could assert their complaints within the context
of 30 CFR 842.11, 842.12, 842.15, and 843.21. With respect to more global remedies such as the reduction of State grants
or the termination or the substitution of Federal enforcement provided by paragraph (c) of proposed &sect; 843.24,
OSM could accept and review information submitted by citizens with a view to determining whether such remedies were
appropriate under the circumstances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter also took issue with the provision of paragraph (b) of proposed &sect;843.24 in that such provision
would have provided that OSM take action under the provisions of 30 CFR 843.21 if OSM had reason to believe that a State
had issued a permit improvidently within the meaning of 30 CFR 773.20. The commenter questioned the legality of 30
CFR 773.20 and 843.21 and asserted that these improvidently issued permit rules violated SMCRA. OSM disagrees with
commenter's criticisms. OSM considers these rules to be legal. OSM incorporates by reference the arguments that
the Department has made defending such rules in briefs filed in the case of

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter representing State regulatory authorities questioned the provision of paragraph (c) of proposed &sect;843.24
which stated that a State regulatory authority would be excused from a failure to comply with the State program equivalents
of the AVS-related regulations if such non-compliance was the result of a ``mandatory injunction.'' The commenter
asked for clarification of this term.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed regulation, a mandatory injunction would be an order to a regulatory authority by a court with jurisdiction
over which the regulatory authority has no control. Such an order would have the effect of ordering or otherwise preventing
the regulatory authority from complying with the provisions of the regulations cited in paragraph (c) of proposed
&sect;843.24.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter representing a State regulatory authority indicated approval of the requirement contained in paragraph
(c) of proposed &sect;843.24 that a State's failure to comply with proposed &sect;&sect;773.22, 773.23, 773.24,
773.26, and 843.23 be a ``knowing'' failure, before sanctions could be imposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM agrees with commenter and has retained the ``knowing'' standard in paragraph (c) of the final rule adopted as described
below. The determination of what constitutes a State's ``knowing'' behavior would be made based upon a full consideration
of the facts. In substance, the issue would be whether the State knew or had reason to know that its actions constituted
a failure to comply with the regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM has determined to adopt the proposed rule, with certain modifications, as final rule &sect;843.24. The final
rule and the rationale behind such modifications are now described.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, in paragraph (a) of the proposed rule, a reference to proposed &sect;773.26 has been deleted from among the
list of regulations with which a State must comply to avoid action by OSM. As discussed previously, proposed &sect;773.26
has been renumbered and adopted as final &sect;773.25. Accordingly, a reference to &sect;773.25 has been substituted
in paragraph (a) of final &sect;843.24. A similar substitution has also been made in paragraph (c) of the final rule.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, OSM has deleted subparagraph (a)(2) of proposed &sect;843.24. The proposed section would have required
action by OSM when OSM determined that a State had systemically failed to comply with proposed &sect;773.27, periodic
check of ownership or control information. As has been discussed previously, OSM is deferring action on proposed
&sect;773.27 as part of a subsequent rulemaking. See 58 FR 34652 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In dealing with a similar deferral with respect to proposed &sect;843.23 described above in this preamble, OSM was
able to allow references to proposed &sect;843.23 to remain in other final rules in the event of the ultimate adoption
of 843.23. If &sect;843.23 is ultimately not adopted, the references in the final rules to it will be mere surplusage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unlike those other references to proposed &sect;843.23, the references to proposed &sect;773.27 contained in final
&sect;843.24 are presented within a context of defining and applying a special standard, systemic noncompliance,
applicable only to a State's failure to comply with &sect;773.27. The rationale for adopting the particular standard
of systemic noncompliance is inextricably linked to the issue of whether the adoption of proposed &sect;773.27 is
appropriate. Accordingly, both issues will be appropriately addressed together in the separate rulemaking. Thus,
OSM has deleted all of subparagraph (a)(2) of proposed &sect;843.24.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the provisions of paragraph (c) of proposed &sect;843.24 would have required OSM to initiate action under
&sect;&sect;735.21 or 886.18 and/or &sect;733.12 if OSM determined that a State had failed to comply in a systemic
manner with the State program equivalent to &sect;773.27. In the final &sect;843.24, OSM has deleted such language
for the reasons justifying a similar deletion of subparagraph (a)(2) of the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM emphasizes that the deletion of this language does not indicate that OSM has made a prejudgment with respect to
the ultimate adoption of proposed &sect;773.27 or with respect to the issue of systemic noncompliance with respect
to such proposed section. These matters will be addressed in the subsequent rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the above discussion, &sect;843.24 is adopted as modified.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
This rule will apply, through cross-referencing, in those States with Federal programs: California, Georgia, Idaho,
Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, and Washington. The Federal
programs for these States appear at 30 CFR parts 905, 910, 912, 921, 922, 933, 937, 939, 941, 942, and 947, respectively.
The rule will also apply through cross-referencing to Indian lands as provided in 30 CFR part 750. No comments were
received concerning unique conditions in any of these Federal program states or on Indian lands which would require
changes to the national rules or as specific amendments to any or all of the Federal programs or the Indian lands program.

Effect of the Rule on State Programs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The provisions of section 503(a)(1) of the Act require that State laws regulating surface coal mining and reclamation
operations be ``in accordance with'' the requirements of the Act. Further, section 503(a)(7) of the Act requires
that State programs contain rules and regulations ``consistent with'' regulations issued by the Secretary pursuant
to the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These terms are defined at &sect;730.5 of title 30 of the Code of Federal Regulations to require that State programs
contain procedures which are, with respect to the Act, no less stringent than the Act; and with respect to the Secretary's
regulations, no less effective than the Secretary's regulations in meeting the requirements of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following promulgation of this final rule, OSM will evaluate State programs to determine whether any changes in these
programs will be necessary. If the Director determines that any State program provisions should be amended to be made
no less effective than the revised Federal rules, the individual States will be notified in accordance with the provisions
of 30 CFR 732.17.

This rule has been reviewed under the applicable standards of Section 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice
Reform (56 FR 55195). In general, the requirements of Section 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778 are covered by the preamble
discussion of this rule. Additional remarks follow concerning individual elements of the Executive Order:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
A. What is the Preemptive Effect, if any, to be Given to the Regulation?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rule would have the same preemptive effect as other standards adopted pursuant to SMCRA. To retain primacy, States
have to adopt and apply standards for their regulatory programs that are no less effective than those set forth in OSM's
rules. Any State law that is inconsistent with, or that would preclude implementation of this proposed rule would
be subject to preemption under SMCRA section 505 and implementing regulations at 30 CFR 730.11. To the extent that
the rules would result in preemption of State law, the provisions of SMCRA are intended to preclude inconsistent State
laws and regulations. This approach is established in SMCRA, and has been judicially affirmed. See

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to any judicial challenge to the application of the rule, however, administrative procedures must be exhausted.
In situations involving OSM application of the rule, applicable administrative procedures may be found at 43 CFR

links involving the applicant, including information obtained pursuant to &sect;&sect;773.22, 773.23, 778.13,
and 778.14 of this chapter, the regulatory authority shall not issue the permit if any surface coal mining and reclamation
operation owned or controlled by either the applicant or by any person who owns or controls the applicant is currently
in violation of the Act, any Federal rule or regulation promulgated pursuant thereto, a State program, or any Federal
or State law, rule, or regulation pertaining to air or water environmental protection. In the absence of a failure-to-abate
cessation order, the regulatory authority may presume that a notice of violation issued pursuant to &sect;843.12
of this chapter or under a Federal or State program is being corrected to the satisfaction of the agency with jurisdiction
over the violation where the abatement period for such notice of violation has not yet expired and where, as part of
the violation information provided pursuant to &sect;778.14 of this chapter, the applicant has provided certification
that such violation is in the process of being so corrected. Such presumption shall not apply where evidence to the
contrary is set forth in the permit application, or where the notice of violation is issued for nonpayment of abandoned
mine land reclamation fees or civil penalties. If a current violation exists, the regulatory authority shall require
the applicant or person who owns or controls the applicant, before the issuance of the permit, to either_

Review criteria.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) A regulatory authority shall find that a surface coal mining and reclamation permit was improvidently issued
if_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Under the violations review criteria of the regulatory program at the time the permit was issued: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The regulatory authority should not have issued the permit because of an unabated violation or a delinquent penalty
or fee; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The permit was issued on the presumption that a notice of violation was in the process of being corrected to the satisfaction
of the agency with jurisdiction over the violation, but a cessation order subsequently was issued; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The violation, penalty, or fee:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Remains unabated or delinquent; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Is not the subject of a good faith appeal, or of an abatement plan or payment schedule with which the permittee or
other person responsible is complying to the satisfaction of the responsible agency; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Where the permittee was linked to the violation, penalty, or fee through ownership or control under the violations
review criteria of the regulatory program at the time the permit was issued, an ownership or control link between the
permittee and the person responsible for the violation, penalty, or fee still exists, or where the link has been severed,
the permittee continues to be responsible for the violation, penalty, or fee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The provisions of &sect;773.25 of this part shall be applicable when a regulatory authority determines: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Whether a violation, penalty, or fee existed at the time that it was cited, remains unabated or delinquent, has
been corrected, is in the process of being corrected, or is the subject of a good faith appeal, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Whether any ownership or control link between the permittee and the person responsible for the violation, penalty,
or fee existed, still exists, or has been severed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Remedial measures.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) A regulatory authority which, under paragraph (b) of this section, finds that because of an unabated violation
or a delinquent penalty or fee a permit was improvidently issued shall use one or more of the following remedial measures:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Implement, with the cooperation of the permittee or other person responsible, and of the responsible agency,
a plan for abatement of the violation or a schedule for payment of the penalty or fee; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Impose on the permit a condition requiring that in a reasonable time the permittee or other person responsible
abate the violation or pay the penalty or fee; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Suspend the permit until the violation is abated or the penalty or fee is paid; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Rescind the permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. If the regulatory authority decides to suspend the permit, it shall afford at least 30 days' written notice to the
permittee. If the regulatory authority decides to rescind the permit, it shall issue a notice in accordance with &sect;773.21
of this part. In either case, the permittee shall be given the opportunity to request administrative review of the
notice under 43 CFR 4.1370 through 4.1377, where OSM is the regulatory authority, or under the State program equivalent,
where a State is the regulatory authority. The regulatory authority's decision shall remain in effect during the
pendency of the appeal, unless temporary relief is granted in accordance with 43 CFR 4.1376 or the State program equivalent.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rulemaking amends regulations of the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) applicable to surface coal mining
hearings and appeals by adding procedural rules for administrative review of a decision by the Office of Surface Mining
Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) to suspend or rescind permits that should not have been issued, and a decision by
OSM in response to (a) a challenge, by an applicant or other person shown in the Applicant Violator System, to a finding
that he or she is in an ownership or control link to any person or (b) a challenge, by an applicant or other person shown
in the Applicant Violator System in an ownership or control link to any person cited in a federal violation notice,
to the status of the violation in the notice. The final rulemaking provides for a hearing before an administrative
law judge and for discretionary review of the administrative law judge's initial decision by the Interior Board of
Land Appeals (IBLA). In addition, existing 43 CFR 4.1105(a)(2) is amended to include a reference to the rules added
by this rulemaking.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
OHA's proposed rulemaking was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on September 6, 1991 (56 FR 45806&hyph;11). Proposed 43 CFR 4.1370&hyph;4.1377 set forth new OHA procedures for reviewing
OSM decisions to suspend or rescind permits OSM finds were improvidently issued under 30 CFR 773.20. Proposed 43 CFR
4.1380&hyph;4.1387 set forth new OHA procedures for reviewing OSM decisions finding that a person is in an ownership
or control link to a person currently in violation of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA)
or other applicable law. In addition, OHA proposed to amend the existing rule that establishes OSM's burden of proof
in individual civil penalty proceedings, 43 CFR 3.1307(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed 43 CFR 4.1370&hyph;4.1377 and 4.1380&hyph;4.1387 are based on section 510(c) of SMCRA, 30 U.S.C. 1260(c)
(1988). This section requires an applicant for a surface coal mining and reclamation permit to file with the permit
application a schedule listing all notices of violations of SMCRA and any law, rule, or regulation of the United States,
or of any department or agency in the United States pertaining to air or water environmental protection incurred by
the applicant in connection with any surface coal mining operation during the three-year period prior to the date
of application. Where the schedule or other information indicates that any surface coal mining operation owned or
controlled by the applicant is currently in violation of the Act or other air or water environmental protection laws,
the permit shall not be issued until the applicant submits proof that such violation has been corrected or is in the
process of being corrected to the satisfaction of the regulatory authority, department, or agency which has jurisdiction
over such violation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to implement section 510(c), OSM has promulgated a rule defining the words ``owned or controlled'' in that
section, as well as ``owns or controls.'' 30 CFR 773.5. It has adopted a rule requiring that an application for a permit
include information about each person who owns or controls the applicant, within the meaning of &sect;773.5, and
about any surface coal mining operation owned or controlled by either the applicant or any person who owns or controls
the applicant. 30 CFR 778.13(c), (d). It has adopted a regulation concerning review of applications for permits that
provides: ``[b]ased on available information *&blank;*&blank;*, the regulatory authority shall not issue the
permit if any surface coal mining and reclamation operation owned or controlled by either the applicant or by any person
who owns or controls the applicant is currently in violation of the Act or any other law, rule or regulation referred
to in this paragraph.'' 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). This is the so-called ``permit block,'' referring to the language in
section 510(c) that states ``the permit shall not be issued until the applicant submits proof'' that a violation of
a surface coal mining operation owned or controlled by the applicant has been corrected or is in the process of being
corrected. OSM has also established the Applicant/Violator System (AVS), a computerized system to store data regarding
violations and ownership and control links to those violations. See

OHA's proposed rules were published on the same day as OSM proposed related rules defining the AVS, requiring its use
in reviewing permit applications to determine whether there are any ownership or control links between applicants
and persons in violation, and proposing procedures and standards for an applicant or other person shown in the AVS
to challenge ownership and control links shown in the AVS and the status of the violation. 56 FR 45780&hyph;45804 (Sept.
6, 1991). OSM also proposed to amend its existing rules governing suspension and rescission of improvidently issued
permits. OSM's proposed rules provided a right to review of its decisions to suspend or rescind a permit under the procedures
set forth in OHA's proposed rulemaking of sections 4.1370 through 4.1377. See proposed &sect;773.20(c)(2), 56 FR
45799 (Sept. 6, 1991). OSM's proposed rules also provided a right to review of its written decisions on challenges
to ownership and control links and the status of violations shown in the AVS under the procedures set forth in OHA's
proposed rulemaking of sections 4.1380 through 4.1387. See proposed 30 CFR 773.24(d)(2)(ii), 56 FR 45800 (Sept.
6, 1991).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OHA received comments on its proposed rules from Texas Utilities Services, Inc. (TU Services), the Joint National
Coal Association/American Mining Congress Committee on Surface Mining Regulations (NCA/AMC), and the National
Wildlife Federation (NWF). The NCA/AMC comments dealt with both OHA's and OSM's proposed rules.

Proposed Amendment of 43 CFR 4.1307(a)(3) Withdrawn
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As part of its September 6, 1991, proposed rulemaking, OHA proposed an amendment to 43 CFR 4.1307(a)(3) at 56 FR 45808
which set forth an element of OSM's prima facie case in proceedings to review the assessment of individual civil penalties.
Proposed 43 CFR 4.1307(a)(3) complemented proposed rules by OSM at 56 FR 48924, 48929&hyph;30 (Sept. 26, 1991) addressing
individual civil penalties. Both TU Services' and NCA/AMC's comments expressed reservations about the proposed
amendment of 43 CFR 4.1307(a)(3). By a notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
on October 16, 1992, OSM withdrew its September 26, 1991, proposed rulemaking. 57 FR 47431 (Oct. 16, 1992). Therefore,
OHA hereby withdraws the corresponding proposed amendment to 43 CFR 4.1307(a)(3). Because this proposed rule concerning
an element of OSM's prima facie case in individual civil penalty proceedings is withdrawn, no response to the comments
concerning it is necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, the NCA/AMC comments address both the proposed OSM rules and the proposed OHA rules ``[b]ecause [their]
comments on the proposal by [OHA] are interrelated with [their] concerns about the OSM proposal.'' NCA/AMC's comments
that relate to the procedures for administrative review are addressed here.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Procedural Due Process
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NCA/AMC state that although the proposed rules ``purport to establish a comprehensive scheme for administrative
review of ownership and control determinations emanating from the AVS, they fall far short of providing the meaningful
guarantees that the due process clause requires.'' They fall short, NCA/AMC state, because the procedures do not
allow one to challenge the existence of the violation that forms the basis for a permit block under section 510(c).
Further, the proposed rules do not provide ``any opportunity for challenging either the status of the violation or
the validity of the AVS link 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
prior 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to the deprivation of the operator's property interest through permit denial, suspension, or revocation, unless
the applicant is able to meet the stringent requirements for seeking temporary relief'' contained in proposed 43
CFR 4.1386 (emphasis in original). NCA/AMC state that the ``right to notice and a hearing prior to a governmental deprivation
of private property is a cornerstone of American jurisprudence, and is a well-established principle in cases involving
the constitutionality of SMCRA provisions'' that the proposed rules fail to recognize. NCA/AMC state that an appeal
or challenge to AVS information ``must, of necessity, include the right to a full and fair determination on the merits
of the violation in advance of any decision to prohibit mining through the sanctions contained within section 510(c).''

, 424 U.S. 319 (1976), the proposed rules do not afford due process, NCA/AMC argue.

A fundamental requirement of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States that ``[n]o person shall

heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.

[O]ur prior decisions indicate that identification of the specific dictates of due process generally requires consideration
of three distinct factors: First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk
of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional
or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government's interest, including the function involved
and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.

, 397 U.S. 254 (1970), the Supreme Court decided procedural due process requires that a state grant an evidentiary
hearing before suspending or terminating welfare payments to an individual who meets the statutory qualifications
for receiving them. ``[T]he crucial factor in this context,'' the Court observed, ``is that termination of aid pending
resolution of a controversy over eligibility may deprive an

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the procedures proposed for OSM decisions and for OHA administrative review of those decisions provide adequate
due process protection of the interests involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rules recognize a distinction between a person who holds a permit that might be suspended or rescinded
because OSM determines it was improvidently issued (43 CFR 4.1370&hyph;4.1377) and a person who has applied for a
permit or might apply for one in the future (43 CFR 4.1380&hyph;4.1387). A person who holds a permit is entitled to more
protection than the person who has applied for one or plans to do so. In recognition of this distinction, OSM's final
rule 30 CFR 773.20(b)(2) will provide, for a person who has a permit, that OSM will determine whether a violation, penalty
or fee existed when it was cited and whether an ownership or control link between a permittee and the person responsible
for the violation existed, still exists, or has been severed, before issuing a notice to suspend or rescind a permit.
An applicant for a permit, however, may challenge the existence of a violation in a review proceeding under 43 CFR 4.1360&hyph;4.1369
after the application has been denied, not before. An applicant (or any other person shown in the AVS) may challenge
an ownership or control link or the status of a violation before a permit application is denied, or even filed, under
proposed 30 CFR 773.24, as discussed further below. (The ``status of a violation'' concerns whether the violation
remains outstanding, has been or is in the process of being corrected, or is the subject of an administrative or judicial
appeal. The status of a violation is distinct from ``the existence of a violation,'' i.e., whether the violation existed
at the time it was cited.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``private interest that will be affected,'' i.e., a permit, is limited. A permit is issued for a five-year term
(with a right of renewal unless its terms or other requirements are not being met), 30 U.S.C. 1256(b), (d) (1988), and
is conditioned on compliance with several performance standards, 30 U.S.C. 1265(a) (1988). It may be terminated,
revised, reviewed, suspended, or revoked. 30 U.S.C. 1256(c), 1261(c), 1265(c), 1271(a)(4) (1988). Thus, while
valuable, a permit to conduct surface coal mining is not a private interest comparable to the welfare benefits in

 at 343, the Supreme Court held that termination of disability payments may be effected without a pretermination evidentiary
hearing. Similarly, suspension or rescission of a surface coal mining permit does not require a prior hearing in addition
to the other procedural safeguards provided in the OSM and OHA rules.

Those rules significantly reduce ``the risk of an erroneous deprivation'' of a permit. If OSM finds a permit was improvidently
issued because at the time it was issued one or more of the circumstances set forth in the review criteria in 30 CFR 773.20(b)(1)
existed, it does so in accordance with the standards for challenging ownership or control links and the status of violations
in proposed 30 CFR 773.26, 56 FR 45801&hyph;45803 (Sept. 6, 1991). See proposed 30 CFR 773.20(b)(2), 56 FR 45799 (Sept.
6, 1991). As mentioned above, these standards will apply, under OSM's final rule 30 CFR 773.20(b)(2), to a determination
whether a violation, penalty, or fee existed at the time it was cited, remains unabated or delinquent, has been or is
in the process of being corrected, or is the subject of an appeal, and whether an ownership or control link between the
permittee and the person responsible for the violation, penalty, or fee existed, still exists, or has been severed.
OSM has a choice of four remedial measures if it finds a permit was improvidently issued, including suspension or rescission
of the permit. 30 CFR 773.20(c); see proposed &sect;773.20(c)(1), 56 FR 45799 (Sept. 6, 1991). If it decides to suspend,
it will give the permittee 30 days written notice and inform the permittee of its right to review under 43 CFR 4.1370

 See proposed 30 CFR 773.20(c)(2), 56 FR 45799 (Sept. 6, 1991). If it decides to rescind, it will issue the permittee

was improvidently issued and will inform the permittee of its right to review under 43 CFR 4.1370

Under OHA's proposed rules 43 CFR 4.1370&hyph;4.1377, the permittee may file a request for review with OHA that includes
OSM's notice; documentary proof or offers of proof concerning the &sect;773.20(b) review criteria (or their analogues
in &sect;773.21(a)(1)&hyph;(4)); other relevant information; a request for specific relief; and a request for
an evidentiary hearing. &sect;4.1372. The permittee may amend its request for review once as a matter of right before
OSM files a response and may also do so afterwards with leave of the administrative law judge. The administrative law
judge is to convene the hearing within 90 days of receiving responses to the request (unless the parties waive this
deadline); this gives the parties an opportunity to conduct discovery under 43 CFR 4.1130&hyph;4.1141. &sect;4.1373.
The administrative law judge must issue an initial decision within 30 days of the date the hearing record is closed.
&sect;4.1375. OSM has the burden of going forward to present a prima facie case in support of its notice while the person
requesting review has the ultimate burden of persuasion that the notice is in error. &sect;4.1374. Any party may file
a petition for discretionary review of the administrative law judge's initial decision with IBLA. The petition shall
attach a copy of this decision and specify the alleged errors. Other parties have 30 days to file responses, after which
IBLA shall issue a decision within 60 days denying the petition or granting it and deciding the merits. &sect;4.1377.

OSM's proposed rule provides that its decision to suspend or rescind will remain in effect during the time a request
for review is pending in OHA unless temporary relief is granted in accordance with 43 CFR 4.1376. 30 CFR 773.20(c)(2),
56 FR 45799 (Sept. 6, 1991). Proposed 43 CFR 4.1376 provides that with a request for review_or at any time before the
administrative law judge issues the initial decision_any party may petition for temporary relief from OSM's notice
of suspension or notice of proposed suspension and rescission. Under &sect;4.1376, the petition must show that the
petitioner has a substantial likelihood of prevailing on the merits and that the relief it seeks will not adversely
affect public health or safety or cause significant, imminent environmental harm. Other parties have 5 days to file
responses. The administrative law judge must hold a hearing within 10 days of the filing of the responses if a hearing
has been requested and must issue a decision granting or denying temporary relief within 5 days of the date of the hearing,
or the filing of the responses if no hearing is held. If all parties have been notified of the petition and given an opportunity
to respond (and a hearing has been held if requested), the administrative law judge may grant temporary relief if the
petitioner has demonstrated a substantial likelihood of prevailing on the merits and the relief will not adversely
affect public health or safety or cause significant, imminent environmental harm. These standards are based on those
contained in 30 U.S.C. 1275(c) (1988). As noted in the preamble to the proposed regulations, 56 FR at 45807 (Sept. 6,
1991), the focus of the adverse effect inquiry would be on the permitted operation rather than operation allegedly
in violation. Any party may appeal the administrative law judge's decision granting or denying temporary relief
to IBIA, which shall decide the appeal expeditiously, or may seek judicial review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OHA believes ``the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards''_in particular,
an evidentiary hearing before a decision to suspend or rescind is effective_is minimal. As in

at 343&hyph;345, although the definition of ownership and control in 30 CFR 773.5 includes elements or judgment where
witness credibility and veracity will sometimes play a role (e.g., &sect;&sect;773.5(a)(3), 773.5(b)(6)), the
determination is usually made on the basis of documents, such as instruments of ownership or voting securities, or
on the basis of readily and often publicly documentable circumstances such as a person's status as an officer or director
of an entity, the permittee or operator of a surface coal mining operation, or a general partner in a parternship (e.g.,
&sect;&sect;773.5(a)(1)&hyph;(2), 773.5(b)(1)&hyph;(2), (4)&hyph;(5)). Further, a permittee receives sufficient
notice of OSM's decision to suspend a permit (30 days under proposed &sect;773.20(c)(2)) or rescind a permit (up to
180 days under &sect;773.21) to enable it to request review by an administrative law judge before the decision becomes
effective. The provisions in &sect;&sect;4.1370&hyph;4.1377 imposing short time frames for each step of review
significantly reduce delay due to ``the torpidity of [the] administrative review process,''

at 342, especially if temporary relief is sought. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``Government's interest'' is to effectively implement section 510(c), specifically, to ensure that no person
in violation of SMCRA or the other specified environmental laws obtains or retains a permit to conduct surface mining
operations until the violation is corrected or in the process of being corrected. The Department's goal of achieving
compliance with these laws would be significantly burdened if it were required to provide an evidentiary hearing
before OSM could decide to suspend or rescind a permit because the person should not have received the permit when it
was issued. It was OSM's experience in 1992&hyph;93 that providing informal review by OSM of the proposed entry into
the AVS of information concerning ownership or control links became very time-and-personnel-consuming. For 105
cases in 1993, for example, OSM spent more than 11,000 hours from after investigating an ownership or control link
to issuing its final decision, a mean of 105 hours per case. It would be even more costly to require an evidentiary hearing
before a permit was suspended or rescinded; meanwhile, mining would continue while alleged outstanding violations
existed.

permit is suspended or rescinded.

As noted above, OSM's proposed rules also provide that an applicant for a permit or any other person that is shown in
the AVS as having an ownership or control link to a person may challenge the link (unless the applicant or other person
is bound by an earlier administrative or judicial decision concerning the link). See proposed 30 CFR 773.24(a)(1),
56 FR 45800 (Sept. 6, 1991). An applicant or any other person shown in the AVS may also challenge the status of the violation
cited in a federal violation notice naming a person with whom the applicant or other person is linked (unless bound
by a decision concerning the status of the violation). See proposed 30 CFR 773.24(a)(2), 56 FR 45800 (Sept. 6, 1991).
The applicant or other person may submit a written explanation and supporting evidence to OSM concerning the existence
of the link or the status of the violation. See proposed &sect;773.24(b), 56 FR 45800 (Sept. 6, 1991). Applying the
standards for challenging ownership and control links and the status of violations contained in proposed &sect;773.26,
56 FR 45801&hyph;03 (Sept. 6, 1991), OSM will either correct the information in the AVS, if the applicant or other person
shows the link is erroneous or the violation is no longer outstanding, or, if this is not shown, OSM will so notify the
applicant or other person. See proposed &sect;773.24(d), 56 FR 45800 (Sept. 6, 1991). In either event, OSM will issue
a written decision and serve it by certified mail. See proposed &sect;&sect;773.24(d)(2)(i), 56 FR 45800&hyph;01
(Sept. 6, 1991). The applicant or other person has a right to request review within 30 days of service of OSM's decision
under the procedures proposed by OHA in 43 CFR 4.1380&hyph;4.1387. OSM's decision remains in effect pending a decision
on review unless temporary relief is granted under proposed &sect;4.1386. See proposed &sect;773.24(d)(2)(ii),
56 FR 45801 (Sept. 6, 1991).

OHA's procedures in proposed 43 CFR 4.1380&hyph;4.1387 closely parallel those in &sect;&sect;4.1370&hyph;4.1377.
Any person who receives a written OSM decision concerning a challenge to the existence of a link or the status of a violation
may request review. &sect;4.1381. The required contents of the request are set forth in proposed &sect;4.1382; the
request may be amended once as a matter of right before a response is filed by OSM and with the leave of an administrative
law judge thereafter. &sect;4.1382(c). The administrative law judge is to convene a hearing within 90 days of receipt
of the responses unless the parties waive that deadline, and give notice at least 10 days in advance of the hearing.
&sect;4.1383. OSM has the burden of going forward to present a prima facie case in support of its decision, while the
person requesting review has the ultimate burden of persuasion that the decision is in error. &sect;4.1384. An initial
decision is required within 30 days after the record of the hearing is closed. &sect;4.1385. At any time before the
initial decision is issued, any party may file a petition for temporary relief from OSM's decision. Temporary relief
may be granted if all parties to the proceeding have been notified of the petition, have had an opportunity to respond,
and a hearing has been held if requested; and if the petitioner has demonstrated that it has a substantial likelihood
of prevailing on the merits and that temporary relief will not adversely affect public health or safety or cause significant,
imminent environmental harm. &sect;4.1386. Expedited review by IBLA or judicial review of a decision granting or
denying temporary relief may be requested within 30 days of receipt of the decision. &sect;4.1386(h). If temporary
relief is not requested, any party may file a petiton for discretionary review of the administrative law judge's initial
decision within 30 days of receiving it. &sect;4.1387. The Board is to issue a decision denying the petition or granting
it and ruling on the merits within 60 days of the deadline for filing responses to the petition section 4.1387(d).

The nature of a person's interest in an application for a permit cannot be regarded as a ``legitimate claim of entitlement''
to a permit and therefore requires less due process protection than the interest of a person who holds a permit that
is subject to suspension or rescission because it was improvidently issued. See

408 U.S. 564, 569&hyph;71, 577 (1972). For a person who has applied for a permit or may apply for one, due process does
not require a hearing on the existence of an ownership or control link or on the existence of a violation when it was cited
before OSM issues a decision under proposed 30 CFR 773.24. If the proposed procedures in &sect;&sect;4.1370&hyph;4.1377
for administrative review of notices of permit suspension or rescission under proposed 30 CFR 773.20(c)(2) provide
adequate due process protection, as OHA believes, then the parallel procedures in proposed &sect;&sect;4.1380&hyph;4.1387
certainly satisfy due process requirements for OSM's decisions regarding ownership and control links or the status
of a violation under proposed 30 CFR 773.24. In particular, an applicant's opportunity to obtain temporary relief
under 43 CFR 4.1386 from an OSM decision provides sufficient due process at this stage. Further administrative review
is available to an applicant for a permit in an appeal of the denial of the application under existing procedures in
43 CFR 4.1360 through 4.1369, when the existence of the violation may be challenged. Providing an evidentiary hearing
before OSM decisions under proposed 30 CFR 773.24 would severely impede the Department's effective implementation
of section 510(c).

is based on information contained within the AVS. *&blank;*&blank;* Additionally, OSM and OHA propose to require
that any appeals from decisions on the ownership and control presumptions be made before the OHA in accordance with

The regulatory authority in a state that has been delegated primacy under section 503 will retain its authority to
issue permits. Information in the AVS is ``other information available to the regulatory authority,'' within the
meaning of section 510(c), that a state regulatory authority must use in deciding whether or not issuance of a permit
should be blocked. The state regulatory authority's decision is its own_subject, of course, to OSM oversight. See
30 U.S.C. 1202(g), 1211(c), 1253, 1254, 1255, and 1271.

An applicant or other person shown in the AVS in an ownership or control link to any person cited in a state violation
notice may challenge the status of the violation in that notice under the state program equivalents to proposed 30
CFR 773.24(b)&hyph;(d) and 773.26. See proposed 30 CFR 773.24(a)(3), 56 FR 45800 (Sept. 6, 1991). Similarly, decisions
by a state regulatory authority to suspend or rescind a permit are reviewed by the State program equivalent of proposed
43 CFR 4.1370&hyph;4.1377. See proposed 30 CFR 773.20(c)(2), 56 FR 45799 (Sept. 6, 1991). The fact that challenges
to ownerships and control links and to the status of violations are made to OSM by applicants or other persons shown
in the AVS under proposed 30 CFR 773.24(a)(1) and (a)(2), and that OSM's decisions are reviewed under proposed 43 CFR
4.1380&hyph;4.1387, is a function of OSM's maintenance of the data in AVS and its responsibility to keep that data
accurate and up-to-date. But OSM's role in deciding on the accuracy of the data and OHA's role in reviewing those decisions
do not subvert the authority of the state regulatory authority in a primacy state to make decisions on applications
for permits.

NCA/AMC object to OHA's proposed 43 CFR 4.1374(b) and 4.1384(b), which place the ultimate burden of persuasion on
a permittee that seeks review of a notice of proposed suspension or rescission and on an applicant or other persons
that seeks review of an OSM decision on a challenge to an ownership and control link or status of a violation shown in
the AVS. In proposed &sect;&sect;4.1374(a) and 4.1384(a), OSM has the burden of going forward to present a prima facie
case of the validity of the notice or decision. NCA/AMC state that when OSM seeks to overturn a permit as improvidently
issued, it should bear the ultimate burden of proving its case. ``All permits, once issued, should be accorded some
presumption that they were issued in accordance and compliance with applicable law. *&blank;*&blank;* [I]t is the
party seeking to set aside the permitting decision who should bear both the burden of going forward to establish a prima

review of OSM decisions. See 43 CFR 4.1171, 4.1193, 4.1366. OSM's burden of going forward to support a prima facie case
of the validity of its notice or decision means it must present ``sufficient evidence *&blank;*&blank;* to establish
the essential facts *&blank;*&blank;* which evidence will remain sufficient if not contradicted. It is evidence
that will justify but not compel a finding in favor of the one presenting it.''

The NWF comments criticized proposed 43 CFR 4.1371 for its failure to incorporate the rights of citizens to challenge
decisions by OSM regarding improvidently issued permits under 30 CFR 773.20. As explained above, 30 CFR 773.20 provides
that a permit has been improvidently issued if, under the violations review criteria at the time the permit was issued,
the regulatory authority should not have issued the permit. Proposed 43 CFR 4.1371 grants a right of review to a ``permittee
that is served with a notice of suspension under 30 CFR 773.20(c)(2) or a notice of proposed suspension and rescission
under 30 CFR 773.21.'' The rights of citizens to appeal similar decisions have been completely overlooked, NWF states.

Similarly, NWF objects to proposed 43 CFR 4.1381, which authorizes ``[a]ny person who receives a written decision
from OSM'' pursuant to proposed 30 CFR 773.24(d)(2) or 773.25(c)(2) to file a request for review of OSM's finding that
such person is in an ownership or control link to any person cited in a violation notice within the scope of 30 CFR 773.5
and 773.15(b). No provision for citizen-initiated appeals of these decisions exists under the proposed rules, NWF
states. ``Decisions by OSM not to act on the information provided by citizens, or decisions to issue permits in the
face of information that indicates an ownership or control link to a violation, should be subject to review by the Office
of Hearings and Appeals,'' NWF comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NWF also criticizes lack of notice to affected citizens. Although proposed 43 CFR 4.1372(b) provides to ``OSM and
all interested parties'' the right to file an answer to a request for review of a decision to suspend or rescind a permit
as improvidently issued and to request an evidentiary hearing even if the person requesting review does not, it is
silent as to how interested parties other than OSM are to know that a request for review has been filed, NWF states. Only
counsel for OSM would be served with a copy of a request for review under 43 CFR 4.1109, NWF observes. Similarly, the
rules proposed in 43 CFR 4.1380&hyph;4.1387 for review of OSM decisions concerning ownership and control links provide
``no notice to citizens who may be substantially and adversely affected by a reversal of a determination of ownership
and control linkage,'' NWF comments. Specific provisions for notice to all affected persons of appeals of both kinds
of OSM decisions should be adopted, NWF urges.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OHA agrees that provisions for notice to citizens of appeals of OSM decisions concerning permit suspension and rescission
and concerning ownership and control links and for rights of appeal of such OSM decisions were not included in the proposed
rules. Adding such provisions to the final rules on the basis of NWF's comments, however, without providing an opportunity
for notice and comment, might be regarded as inconsistent with the requirements of the Administrative Procedure
Act. See

in the future. Meanwhile, no right of appeal by citizens from OSM decisions not to find an ownership or control link
is available under these rules. Citizens may of course avail themselves of existing procedures, e.g., 30 CFR 773.13,
842.11, 842.12, 842.15, and 843.21, and petition for leave to intervene in proceedings under &sect;&sect;4.1370&hyph;4.1377

Changes in the Final Rules From the Proposed Rules
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OHA believes no revisions to proposed 43 CFR 4.1370&hyph;4.1377 and 4.1380&hyph;4.1387 are required in response
to the comments. However, OHA has made the following changes to the proposed rules to improve their clarity and to remove
references to section numbers of the rules proposed by OSM:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 43 CFR 4.1373(a): The phrase ``If a hearing is requested'' has been added at the beginning of the first sentence,
and the remainder of the sentence revised, to account for the possibility that a hearing might not be requested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 43 CFR 4.1373(b): ``of the date of the hearing'' has been added at the end of the sentence to make clear that notice
shall be given at least 10 days in advance of the hearing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 43 CFR 4.1375: An alternative deadline is provided for issuance of an initial decision when no hearing is held.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. 43 CFR 4.1380: The language concerning the kind of OSM decisions from which a request for review may be filed has been
revised to replace references to 30 CFR 773.5 and 773.15(b) with a more general description, i.e., decisions on challenges
by an applicant or other person shown in the AVS to an ownership or control link or the status of a violation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. 43 CFR 4.1381(a): The specific references to proposed 30 CFR 773.24(d)(2) and 773.25(c)(2) and to 30 CFR 773.5 and
773.15(b) have been replaced with language describing the kind of OSM decision from which a request for review may
be filed, i.e., a written decision by OSM, in response to a challenge from an applicant or other person shown in the AVS,
on whether or not the ownership or control link has been shown to be erroneous or has been rebutted and/or whether the
violation covered by the notice remains outstanding, has been corrected, or is the subject of a good faith appeal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. 43 CFR 4.1383(a): The phrase ``If a hearing is requested'' has been added at the beginning of the first sentence,
and the remainder of the sentence revised, to account for the possibility that a hearing might not be requested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. 43 CFR 4.1383(b): ``of the date of the hearing'' has been added at the end of the sentence to make clear that notice
shall be given at least 10 days in advance of the hearing.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, in order to implement the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act, OHA has added rules (&sect;&sect;4.1371(c),
4.1381(c)) providing the parties an opportunity to employ alternatives means of dispute resolution, as defined
in 5 U.S.C. 571(3) (1988), before the hearing and appeals procedures set forth in the following rules. Any party could
decline this opportunity, in its discretion, at any time. Because no new obligations are imposed and this voluntary
procedure does not affect substantive rights, its adoption does not require separate notice under the Administrative
Procedure Act.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The final rule continues in effect without change 24 CFR 81.41 through 81.49, the book entry provisions of the Secretary's
regulations governing the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae). This final rule authorizes the issuance
and trading in book-entry form of mortgage-backed and debt securities of Fannie Mae. The Federal Housing Enterprises
Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 (``the 1992 Act'') provides for a transition period during which all rules
promulgated by the Secretary under the Fannie Mae Charter Act prior to October 28, 1992, are to remain in effect. Under
the 1992 Act, the transition period expires November 28, 1994, which is 18 months following the appointment of the
Director of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprises Oversight. Today's action is an emergency regulation to continue
the existing book-entry provisions of the regulations in order to avoid disruption to Fannie Mae's continued authority
for book-entry issuance and trading of Fannie Mae securities.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Justification for Final Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In general, the Department publishes a rule for public comment before issuing a rule for effect, in accordance with
its own regulations on rulemaking, 24 CFR part 10. However, part 10 does provide for exceptions from that general rule
where the agency finds good cause to omit advance notice and public participation. The good cause requirement is satisfied
when prior public procedure is ``impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' (24 CFR 10.1)
The Department finds that good cause exists to publish this rule for effect without first soliciting public comment,
in that prior public procedure is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to public interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 No new substantive regulations are being adopted through this rulemaking; rather, the Secretary is merely continuing
in effect rules that were not affected by any substantive statutory change under the Federal Housing Enterprises
Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 (``1992 Act''), enacted as Title XIII of the Housing and Community Development
Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992; codified generally at 12 U.S.C. 4501&hyph;4641). The
rules continued in effect do not include any changes in the statutory authority of the Secretary made by the 1992 Act.
This rule serves the critical need to ensure continued authority for book-entry trading of the large volume of Fannie
Mae debt and mortgage-backed securities issues. At the same time, the rule does not impose any additional burden on
the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
II. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The 1992 Act significantly revised the regulatory requirements and structure for the Federal National Mortgage
Association (Fannie Mae), including its Charter Act (the Federal National Mortgage Association Charter Act, 12
U.S.C. 1716 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Section 1356 of the 1992 Act includes provisions for a transition period during which all rules promulgated by the
Secretary under the Fannie Mae Charter Act prior to October 28, 1992, the date of enactment of the Act, are to remain
in effect. The transition period is to expire 18 months following the appointment of the Director of the Office of Federal
Housing Enterprises Oversight; at such time, both the Secretary's and the Director's rules under the Act were to have
been proposed for public comment and completed in final. The OFHEO Director's appointment was confirmed by the Senate
May 28, 1993; therefore, the 18-month period referenced in Section 1356 expires November 28, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The Secretary will soon propose comprehensive regulations implementing the Secretary's responsibilities under
the 1992 Act, but such regulations will not be effective until after the expiration of the 18-month transition period.
The rules due for automatic expiration on November 28, 1994, include regulations promulgated by the Secretary in
1978 that authorize book-entry procedures for issuance and trading of securities of Fannie Mae (24 CFR 81.41&hyph;81.49).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Today, virtually all of Fannie Mae's debt and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) issuances and trading market depend
on book-entry procedures. As of September 30, 1994, Fannie Mae debt outstanding was $239.3 billion and Fannie Mae
MBS were $523.5 billion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The 1978 book-entry rules assure the efficient trading of Fannie Mae securities and enhance the secondary mortgage
market. To ensure that Fannie Mae may use book-entry procedures, the Secretary issues this emergency regulation
to continue in effect the 1978 book-entry rules. The Department of the Treasury requires that book-entry regulations
be in force for agencies whose securities are recorded under the book-entry procedures of the Federal Reserve System.
This recodification is required, therefore, to assure continued authority for trading of Fannie Mae securities
in book-entry form after November 28, 1994. Failure to extend these regulations may be disruptive to the financial
markets.

 Prior to the issuance of book-entry regulations, Fannie Mae, investors, brokers, and dealers incurred increased
administrative expenses because of the lack of such authority. Accordingly, the 1978 regulations imposed book-entry
requirements that enhance Fannie Mae's charter purpose of assisting the secondary mortgage market by improving
the distribution of investment capital available for home financing (12 U.S.C. 1716(3)&hyph;(4)).

 The Secretary is empowered to recodify these regulations under section 1321(a) of the 1992 Act (12 U.S.C. 4541), which
confers on the Secretary general regulatory authority and the authority to ``make such rules and regulations as shall
be necessary and proper'' to ensure that the purposes of the 1992 Act and the Fannie Mae Charter Act are accomplished.
