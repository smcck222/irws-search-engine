SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is proposing changes in our current regulations on alternative forms of
annuity to implement the changes in sections 8343a and 8420a of title 5, United States Code, made by the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1993. These regulations provide for the termination of the alternative form of annuity for
employees whose annuities commence on or after October 1, 1994, except for employees who have a life-threatening
affliction of other critical medical condition. They would also revise the list of critical medical conditions considered

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Since 1986, some individuals retiring under the Civil Service Retirement System or the Federal Employees Retirement
System have been eligible to elect an alternative form of annuity. The alternative form of annuity consisted of a lump-sum
payment of the individual's retirement deductions plus reduced monthly benefits. The amount of the reduction was
determined so that the present value of the future unreduced annuity would be actuarially equivalent to the present
value of the lump sum plus the future reduced annuity payments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Pub. L. 103&hyph;66, amended sections 8343a and 8420a of title 5, United
States Code, to limit eligibility for the alternative form of annuity for individuals whose annuities commence on
or after October 1, 1994, to those with a ``life-threatening affliction or other critical medical condition.'' These
regulations would change sections 831.2203(h) and 842.703(d) to reflect this new statutory eligibility requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Our proposed change in sections 831.2207 and 842.707 refines the list of medical conditions that constitute 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
prima facie
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 evidence of a ``life-threatening affliction or other critical medical condition.'' We are removing two conditions
from the list (ventricular tachycardia and ventricular flutter). We are also clarifying the severity required for
four other medical conditions before we will accept those conditions as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
prima facie 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
evidence. Of course, this change in no way affects a claimant's right to show that medical conditions, not on the list,
are qualifying conditions under sections 831.2207(c)(3)(iv) and 842.707(c)(3)(iv) of Title 5, Code of Federal
Regulations.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule places into regulation a limited number of Federal staffing provisions that were formerly in the
Federal Personnel Manual (FPM). The remaining ``provisionally retained'' portions of the FPM will be abolished
by December 31, 1994. This proposed rule deletes or replaces regulatory language which references the FPM. Its provisions
also define or clarify terms and describe procedures used in veterans' preference, reductions in force, veterans'
readjustment appointments, term appointments, seasonal and intermittent employment, noncompetitive term appointments
based on Peace Corps service, exemption of certain employees from coverage of the Part-time Career Employment Act,
physical requirements for employment, and actions taken during a national emergency (including the possible appointment
of relatives). They extend delegations to agencies for assigning persons serving under excepted appointments to
the work of positions in the competitive service; making temporary appointments of worker trainees pending establishment
of a register (TAPER); and extending time limits for overseas temporary appointments. The proposed provisions also
delete requirements for a number of regular reports. In the case of part 351, Reduction in Force, and part 353, Restoration
to Duty From Military Service or Compensable Injury, sections are reworded for clarity and consistency with decisions
of the Merit Systems Protection Board.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Vice President's National Performance Review (NPR) recommended that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)
``phase out the entire 10,000 page Federal Personnel Manual (FPM).'' The President endorsed the NPR recommendations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In planning to abolish the FPM, OPM met over an extended period with representatives of agencies and employee unions
to identify which FPM policies should be dropped, which should be continued in regulation, and which should be available
as a helpful reference in an alternative format. The resulting recommendations were reviewed and endorsed by the
Interagency Advisory Group of agency personnel directors and by the National Partnership Council.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule carries out the recommendations of those groups to retain selected current policies. Regulations
to establish new policies, including implementation of Pub. L. 103&hyph;353 (veterans' reemployment rights),
will be proposed separately.

Basic authority. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Agencies may make emergency-indefinite appointments without OPM approval during any national emergency as defined
in paragraph (a) of this section. The head of an agency with a defense-related mission may request OPM's approval to
make emergency-indefinite appointments without a declared national emergency when the President has authorized
the call-up of some portion of the military reserves for some military purpose. The request must demonstrate that
normal hiring procedures cannot meet surge employment requirements and that use of emergency-indefinite appointments
is necessary for economy and efficiency. Except as provided by paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, agencies must
make emergency-indefinite appointments from appropriate registers of eligibles as long as there are available
eligibles.

Establishment and maintenance of RPL.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The reemployment priority list (RPL) is the mechanism agencies use to give reemployment consideration to their
former competitive service employees separated by reduction in force (RIF) or fully recovered from a compensable
injury after more than 1 year. The RPL is a required component of agency positive placement programs. In filling vacancies,
the agency must give RPL registrants priority consideration over certain outside job applicants and, if it chooses,
also may consider RPL registrants before considering internal candidates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Each agency is required to establish and maintain a reemployment priority list for each commuting area in which
it separates eligible competitive service employees by RIF or when a former employee recovers from a compensable
injury after more than 1 year, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. For purposes of this subpart, ``agency''
means ``Executive agency'' as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105. All components of an agency within the commuting area utilize
a single RPL and are responsible for giving priority consideration to the RPL registrants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) An agency need not maintain a distinct RPL for employees separated by reduction in force if the agency operates
a placement program for its employees and obtains OPM concurrence that the program satisfies the basic requirements
of this subpart. The intent of this provision is to allow agencies to adopt different placement strategies that are
effective for their particular programs yet satisfy legal entitlements to priority consideration in reemployment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22. In &sect;330.202, paragraph (a)(1) is revised and paragraph (c) is added to read as follows:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a)(1) To be entered on the RPL, an eligible employee under &sect;330.203 must complete an application prescribed
by the employing agency and inform the agency of any significant changes in the information provided. This application
must provide for the employee to specify the conditions under which he or she will accept employment, including grade,
occupation, and minimum hours of work per week, in addition to positions at the same representative rate and type of
work schedule (e.g., full-time, part-time, seasonal, intermittent, on-call, etc.) as the position from which the
employee was or will be separated. Registration may take place as soon as a specific notice of separation under part
351 of this chapter, or a Certification of Expected Separation as provided in &sect;351.807 of this chapter, has been
issued. The employee must submit the application within 30 calendar days after the RIF separation date. An employee
who fails to submit a timely application is not entitled to be placed on the RPL. If an agency has components scattered
throughout a large commuting area, the agency may allow eligibles to indicate their availability only for certain
sub-areas within the commuting area. However, the agency cannot deny consideration throughout the entire commuting
area if the eligible wants it.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(d)(1) When an individual declines an offer of career, career-conditional, or excepted appointment without time
limit or fails to reply to an inquiry, under this subpart, and the position meets the acceptable conditions shown in
his or her application, he or she loses RPL consideration for all positions with a representative rate at or below that
grade. However, subject to paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, the individual retains eligibility for positions
with a higher representative rate up to the last grade held.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Also, an individual is taken off the RPL before the period of eligibility expires when the individual:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Requests removal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Receives a career, career-conditional, or excepted appointment without time limit in any agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Declines an offer of career, career-conditional, or excepted appointment without time limit or fails to reply
to an inquiry, under this subpart, by the employee's former agency, concerning a specific position having a representative
rate at least as high, and with the same type of work schedule, as that of the position from which the person was or will
be separated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Separates for some other reason before the RIF separation takes effect (such as retirement, resignation, etc.).
An employee who retires the day after separation by RIF, or later, does not lose RPL eligibility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Declines an interview or fails to appear for a scheduled interview only if notified in advance of this requirement
and the subsequent consequences.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) In the case of an individual enrolled on an RPL for Alaska or overseas, leaves the area covered by that RPL or becomes
disqualified for overseas employment because of previous service or residence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) When an agency removes an individual from the RPL because of failure to reply to a specific permanent job offer or
an inquiry of availability for a specific permanent vacancy, the agency must have evidence to show that a written offer
or inquiry was made and received. The written offer or inquiry to the individual must clearly state that failure to
respond will result in loss of RPL consideration for all grades or for lower grades, as appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Declination of nonpermanent employment has no effect on RPL eligibility or continuation of RPL consideration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Consideration for all jobs (whether permanent or nonpermanent) is suspended for any individual who cannot be
reached by the agency. Submission of an updated application can reinstate consideration, but the period of eligibility
is not extended beyond the original time set in paragraph (c) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Eligibles who had agreed to transfer with their function but were separated by RIF from the gaining competitive
area are registered on the RPL of the gaining competitive area.

25. Section 330.205 is revised to read as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;330.205
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->
Employment restrictions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The restrictions in paragraph (b) of this section apply to the filling of all competitive service vacancies, regardless
of whether an agency plans to make a temporary, term, or permanent appointment. This means an agency must consider
RPL registrants for nonpermanent as well as permanent positions when they have indicated such interest on their RPL
application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) When a qualified individual is available on an agency's RPL, the agency may not make a final commitment to an individual
not on the RPL to fill a permanent or temporary competitive service position by:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A new appointment, unless the individual appointed is a qualified 10-point preference eligible; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Transfer or reemployment, unless the individual appointed is a preference eligible, is exercising restoration
rights under part 353 of this chapter based on return from military service or recovery from a compensable injury or
disability within 1 year, or is exercising other statutory or regulatory reemployment rights.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Paragraph (b) of this section does not apply to actions involving employees on an agency's rolls, as authorized
below, or in filling a specific position:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) When all qualified individuals on the RPL decline an offer of a specific position or fail to respond to an official
agency inquiry about their availability for it; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) By a current, qualified employee of the agency through:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Detail or position change (promotion, demotion, reassignment); or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Conversion to competitive appointment of employees currently serving under appointments that carry a noncompetitive
conversion eligibility (e.g., Veterans Readjustment Appointee, 30 percent disabled veterans, disabled employees
under Schedule A appointment, Presidential Management Interns, cooperative education students under Schedule
B appointment, and TAPERS); or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Reappointment without a break in service to the same position currently held by an employee serving under a temporary
appointment of 1 year or less (only to another temporary appointment not to exceed 1 year or less and not to a permanent
appointment); or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Extension of an employee's temporary appointment up to the maximum permitted by the appointment authority or
as authorized by OPM.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) By a 30-day special needs appointment or 700 hour temporary appointment of a severely disabled or mentally retarded
individual, when the agency's staffing policies provide for these exceptions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) An agency must clear the RPL at the grade level at which it fills a position (regardless of the full performance level).
Similarly, if an agency advertises a position at multiple grade levels, it must clear the RPL only at the grade level
at which the position is ultimately filled.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Once an agency has cleared its RPL and made a final employment commitment to an individual, the later registration
of another employee on the RPL does not prevent the fulfillment of the original commitment, regardless of when the
individual actually enters on duty.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) When submitting a request for referral of eligibles, an agency is required to indicate that no qualified RPL registrant
is available for the vacancy and therefore the agency may make a new appointment. Similarly, an agency must clear its
RPL before making appointments under a direct-hire authority, which includes the Outstanding Scholar provision,
or delegated examining authority.

(a) (1) An eligible employee under &sect;330.203 is entitled to consideration for positions in the commuting area
for which qualified and available that are at no higher grade (or equivalent), have no greater promotion potential
than the position from which the employee was or will be separated, and have the same type of work schedule. In addition,
an employee is entitled to consideration for any higher grade previously held on a nontemporary basis in the competitive
service from which the employee was demoted under part 351 of this chapter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An employee is considered for positions having the same type of work schedule as the position from which separated

(b) (1) An eligible employee under &sect;330.204 is placed on the RPL for reemployment consideration for his or her
former position or an equivalent one. If the individual cannot be placed in such a position in the former commuting
area, he or she is entitled to priority consideration for an equivalent position elsewhere in the agency at the time
and in a manner as the agency determines will provide the individual with maximum opportunities for consideration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In lieu of expanded consideration in other locations, an individual who cannot be placed in his or her former or
equivalent position in the former commuting area may elect to be considered for the next best available position in
the former commuting area.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An agency must adopt one of the selection methods in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section for use in operating a single
RPL. The agency may adopt the same method for each RPL it establishes or may vary the method by location, but it must adopt
a written policy for each RPL it establishes and maintains. After a method is adopted, the agency uses that method in
filling all positions. While an agency may not vary the method used by individual vacancy, it may at any time switch
selection methods for employees enrolled on the RPL.

Retention standing order. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For each vacancy to be filled, the agency shall place qualified individuals in group and subgroup order in accordance
with part 351 of this chapter. In making a selection, an agency may not pass over an individual in group I to select from
group II and, within a group, may not pass over an individual in a higher subgroup to select from a lower subgroup. Within

(1) For each vacancy to be filled, the agency rates qualified individuals according to their job experience and education.
To do this, an agency shall develop job-related evaluation procedures capable of distinguishing differences in
qualifications measured, which shall be applied in a fair and consistent manner. Based on these procedures, the agency
shall assign qualified individuals a numerical score of at least 70 on a scale of 100. The agency shall grant 5 additional
points to preference eligibles under section 2108(3) (A) and (B) of title 5, United States Code, and 10 additional
points to preference eligibles under section 2108(3) (C) through (G) of that title.

(as defined in &sect;351.203 of this chapter) to the agency by an individual who is on the RPL or has higher standing
than the one appointed. The agency shall notify, in writing, each individual on the RPL who is adversely affected by
an appointment under this paragraph of the reasons for the exception and of the right of appeal to the Merit Systems

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Seasonal employment allows an agency to develop an experienced cadre of employees under career appointment to perform
work which recurs predictably year-to-year. Consistent with the career nature of the appointments, seasonal employees
receive the full benefits authorized to attract and retain a stable workforce. As a result, seasonal employment is
appropriate when the work is expected to last at least 6 months during a calendar year. Recurring work that lasts less
than 6 months each year is normally best performed by temporary employees. Seasonal employment may not be used as a
substitute for full-time employment or as a buffer for the full-time workforce.

Length of the season. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Agencies determine the length of the season, subject to the condition that it be clearly tied to nature of the work.
The season must be defined as closely as practicable so that an employee will have a reasonably clear idea of how much
work he or she can expect during the year. To minimize the adverse impact of seasonal layoffs, an agency may assign seasonal
employees to other work during the projected layoff period. While in nonpay status, a seasonal employee may accept
other employment, Federal or non-Federal, subject to the regulations on political activity (part 733 of this title)
and on employee responsibilities and conduct (part 735), as well as applicable agency policies. Subject to the limitation
on pay from more than one position (5 U.S.C. 5533), a seasonal employee may hold more than one appointment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Employment agreement. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An employment agreement must be executed between the agency and the seasonal employee prior to the employee's entering
on duty. At a minimum, the agreement must inform the employee:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) That he or she is subject to periodic release and recall as a condition of employment,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The minimum and maximum period the employee can expect to work,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The basis on which release and recall procedures will be effected, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The benefits to which the employee will be entitled while in a nonpay status.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Release and recall procedures. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A seasonal employee is released to nonpay status at the end of a season and recalled to duty the next season. Release
and recall procedures must be established in advance and uniformly applied. They may be based on performance, seniority,
veterans' preference, other appropriate indices, or a combination of factors. A seasonal layoff is not subject to
the procedures for furlough prescribed in parts 351 and 752 of this title. Reduction in force or adverse action procedures,
as applicable, are required for a seasonal layoff that is not in accordance with the employment agreement, for example,
if an agency intends to have an employee work less than the minimum amount of time specified in the employment agreement.
However, an agency may develop a new employment agreement to reflect changing circumstances.

An intermittent work schedule is appropriate only when the nature of the work is sporadic and unpredictable so that

basis, it has an obligation to document the change in work schedule from intermittent to part-time or full-time to
ensure proper service credit.

Undue interruption
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means a degree of interruption that would prevent the completion of required work by the employee 90 days after the
employee has been placed in a different position under this part. The 90-day standard should be considered within
the allowable limits of time and quality, taking into account the pressures of priorities, deadlines, and other demands.
However, a work program would generally not be unduly interrupted even if an employee needed more than 90 days after
the reduction in force to preform the optimum quality or quantity of work. The 90-day standard may be extended if placement
is made under this part to a low priority program or to a vacant position.

(b) In a transfer of function, the function must cease in the losing competitive area and continue in an identical form
in the gaining competitive area (i.e., in the gaining competitive area, the function continues to be carried out by
competing employees rather than by noncompeting employees).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Agencies may ask employees in a canvass letter whether the employee wishes to transfer with the function when the
function transfers to a different local commuting area. The canvass letter must give the employee information concerning
entitlements available to the employee if the employee accepts the offer to transfer, and if the employee declines
the offer to transfer. An employee may later change an initial acceptance offer without penalty. However, an employee
may not later change an initial declination of the offer to transfer.

(a) The competitive area losing the function is responsible for identifying the positions of competing employees
with the transferring function. A competing employee is identified with the transferring function on the basis of
the employee's official position. Two methods are provided to identify employees with the transferring function:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Identification Method One; and

agency may supplement the employee's official position description by the use of appropriate records (e.g., work
reports, organizational time logs, work schedules, etc.).

(a) (1) Each agency shall establish competitive levels consisting of all positions in a competitive area which are
in the same grade (or occupational level) and classification series, and which are similar enough in duties, qualification
requirements, pay schedules, and working conditions so that an agency may reassign the incumbent of one position
to any of the other positions in the level without undue interruption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Competitive level determinations are based on each employee's official position, not the employee's personal
qualifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Sex may not be the basis for a competitive level determination, except for a position OPM designates that certification
of eligibles by sex is justified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A probationary period required by subpart I of party 315 of this chapter for initial appointment to a supervisory

(1) Group I includes each career employee who is not serving a probationary period. (A supervisory or managerial employee
serving a probationary period required by subpart I of part 315 of this title is in group I if the employee is otherwise
eligible to be included in this group.) The following employees are in group I as soon as the employee completes any
required probationary period for initial appointment:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) An employee for whom substantial evidence exists of eligibility to immediately acquire status and career tenure,

administrative errors);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(2) Group II includes each career-conditional employee, and each employee serving a probationary period under subpart
H of part 315 of this chapter. (A supervisory or managerial employee serving a probationary period required by subpart
I of part 315 of this title is in group II if the employee has not completed a probationary period under subpart H of part
315 of this title.) Group II also includes an employee when substantial evidence exists of the employee's eligibility
to immediately acquire status and career-conditional tenure, and the employee's case is pending final resolution
by OPM (including cases under Executive Order 10826 to correct certain administrative errors).

(ii) Whose tenure is equivalent to a career-conditional appointment in the competitive service in agencies having
such excepted appointments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Group III includes each employee:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Whose tenure is indefinite (i.e., without specific time limit), but not actually or potentially permanent;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Whose appointment has a specific time limitation of more than 1 year; or

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When a group I or II competitive service employee with a current annual performance rating of record of minimally successful
(Level 2) or equivalent, or higher, is released from a competitive level, an agency shall offer assignment, rather
than furlough or separate, in accordance with paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section to another competitive
position which requires no reduction, or the least possible reduction, in representative rate. The employee must
be qualified for the offered position. The offered position shall be in the same competitive area, last at least 3 months,
and have the same type of work schedule (e.g., full-time, part-time, intermittent, or seasonal) as the position from
which the employee is released. Upon accepting an offer of assignment, or displacing another employee under this
part, an employee retains the same status and tenure in the new position. The promotion potential of the offered position
is not a consideration in determining an employee's right of assignment.

Notification of rights and obligations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When an agency separates, places on leave of absence, restores or fails to restore an employee because of military
duty or compensable injury, it shall notify the employee of his or her rights, obligations, and benefits relating
to Government employment, including any appeal rights to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) as required by
&sect;1201.21 of this title, or where appropriate, the right to grieve under a negotiated grievance procedure. However,
regardless of notification, an employee is still obligated to exercise due diligence in ascertaining his or her rights,
and to seek reemployment within the time limits provided by chapter 43 of title 38 of the U.S. Code, for reemployment
after military service or as soon as he or she is able after a compensable injury.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Upon reemployment, an employee who was absent on military duty or because of compensable injury is generally entitled
to be treated as though he or she had never left. This means the entire period from the time the employee entered military
service or was injured until he or she was reemployed is creditable for purposes of rights and benefits based upon seniority
and length of service, including within-grade increases, career tenure, completion of probation, and leave rate
accrual.

Effect of performance and conduct on restoration rights.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The laws covered by this part do not permit an agency to circumvent the protections afforded by other laws to employees
who face the involuntary loss of their positions. Thus, an employee may not be denied restoration rights because of
poor performance or conduct that occurred prior to the employee's departure for compensable injury or military duty.
However, separation for cause that is substantially unrelated to the injury or to the performance of military duty
negates restoration rights. If during the period of injury or military duty the employee's conduct is such that it
would disqualify him or her for employment under OPM or agency regulations, restoration rights may be denied.

If the function of an employee absent on military duty or compensable injury is transferred to another agency, and
if the employee would have been transferred with the function under part 351 of this chapter had he or she not been absent,
the employee is entitled to be reinstated to a position in the gaining agency that is equivalent to the one he or she left.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (1) The following employees are entitled under 38 U.S.C. 4304 to a leave of absence in connection with military duty:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (i) A member of a Reserve component (Reserve or National Guard) who performs active duty for training or inactive duty
(38 U.S.C. 4304(d)), or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (ii) An employee who reports for enlistment, induction or physical examination (38 U.S.C. 4304(e)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (2) There is no limitation in law as to the timing or duration of leaves of absence, nor is there any authority for an agency
to deny a leave of absence. If an agency has concerns about the timing, frequency, or length of an employee's requests
for a leave of absence, it should contact the commander of the military unit to determine if the duty can be changed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (b) Authorization required.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

(1) An employee on a leave of absence for military duty is required to report for work at the beginning of the first regularly
scheduled workday following release, rejection for service or completion of physical examination. If hospitalized
incident to training or examination, the employee is required to report at the beginning of the first regularly scheduled
workday following discharge from hospitalization, or within 1 year of release from military duty, whichever is earlier.
In all cases, necessary travel time or other delays beyond the individual's control may extend the reporting date.
An employee who fails to report within these time limits is subject to normal agency disciplinary procedures related
to absences from work.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An employee on a leave of absence returns to the position he or she left, or if applicable, to the position to which
reassigned or promoted while absent. The employee is entitled to the same seniority, status, pay and vacation he or
she would have had if not absent on military duty.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) An employee returning from a leave of absence has no special protections against discharge without cause. However,
the employee may not be disadvantaged where vacation leave is concerned. Thus, insofar as possible, the employee
is entitled to have an annual vacation period of extended leave for rest and recreation approved for the same time as
it would ordinarily have been granted.

Each time an employee leaves his or her employment to enter military service, he or she is subject to the time limits
prescribed in 38 U.S.C. 4304 (a) and (b) for purposes of restoration rights. Generally, these are as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Regular active duty 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
soldiers have 4 years plus 1 additional year if the additional duty was ``at the request and for the convenience of the
Federal Government.'' (Their orders or DD Form 214 must so state.) Also, in the event of a Presidential call-up such
as Operation Desert Storm, numerous active duty troops in key positions may be held over beyond their enlistments.
This additional duty is covered because it is ``additional service imposed pursuant to law.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reserves and National Guard 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
are covered under 38 U.S.C. 4304(b)(2). Normally, their restoration rights are limited to 4 years. (They do not get
the extra 5th year ``at the request and for the convenience of the Federal Government.'') To go beyond 4 years, their
service has to be other than for training, it is limited by the time period that the President is authorized to call up
troops (currently 180 days), and, if voluntary, their orders or DD Form 214 must say that the additional duty was at
the request and for the convenience of the Government.

Mobilization authority. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) Since 1978, 10 U.S.C. 673b has authorized the President to call up as many as 200,000 members of the Selected Reserve
for up to 90 days. In 1986, this authority was broadened to allow the President to extend the call-up for an additional
90 days, if necessary, without regard to a state of national emergency or war, for the purpose of augmenting the active
component forces for an operational mission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The President is also authorized by 10 U.S.C. 673a to call up as many as one million members of the Ready Reserves
for not longer than 24 months in a national emergency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Under 10 U.S.C. 672, with a declaration of war or national emergency by the Congress, all Reserve components,
including Standby and Retired, could be ordered to active duty for the duration of the war, plus 6 months.

An employee with restoration rights under 38 U.S.C. 4301 or 4304 (a), (b), or (c) may not be demoted or separated (other
than military separation) while on military duty. He or she is not a ``competing employee'' under section 351.404
of this chapter. If the employee's position is abolished during such absence, the agency must reassign the employee
to another position of like seniority, status, and pay. An employee on a leave of absence under 38 U.S.C. 4304 (d) or
(e) has no special protections in a reduction in force.

Upon reemployment, an employee with a restoration right under 38 U.S.C. 4301 or 4304 (a) or (b) may not be discharged
for a period of 1 year except for cause. A member of a Reserve component returning from an initial period of active duty
for training under 38 U.S.C. 4304 (c) may not be discharged for a period of 6 months except for cause. (Reduction in force

Restoration rights.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fully recovered within 1 year.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An employee who was separated because of a compensable injury and whose full recovery takes longer than 1 year from
the date eligibility for compensation began (or from the time compensable disability recurs if the recurrence begins
after the employee resumes regular full-time employment with the United States), is entitled to be restored immediately
and unconditionally to his or her former position or an equivalent one. Although these restoration rights are agencywide,
the employee's basic entitlement is to the former position or equivalent in the local commuting area the employee
left. If a suitable vacancy does not exist, the employee is entitled to displace an employee occupying a continuing
position under temporary appointment or tenure group III. If there is no such position in the local commuting area,
the agency may offer the employee a position (as described above) in another location. This paragraph also applies
when an injured employee accepts a lower-graded position in lieu of separation and subsequently fully recovers.
A fully recovered employee is expected to return to work immediately upon the cessation of compensation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fully recovered after 1 year
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. An employee who was separated because of a compensable injury and whose full recovery takes longer than 1 year from
the date eligibility for compensation began (or from the time compensable disability recurs if the recurrence begins
after the injured employee resumes regular full-time employment with the United States), is entitled to priority
consideration, agencywide, for restoration to the position he or she left or an equivalent one provided he or she applies
for reappointment within 30 days of cessation of compensation. Priority consideration is accorded by entering the
individual on the agency's reemployment priority list for the competitive service or reemployment list for the excepted
service. If the individual cannot be placed in the former commuting area, he or she is entitled to priority consideration
for an equivalent position elsewhere in the agency. (See parts 302 and 330 of this chapter for more information on how
this may be accomplished for the excepted and competitive services, respectively.) This subpart also applies when
an injured employee accepts a lower-graded position in lieu of separation and subsequently fully recovers.

(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Physically disqualified
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. An individual who is physically disqualified for the former position or equivalent because of a compensable injury,
is entitled to be placed in another position for which qualified that will provide the employee with the same seniority,
status, and pay, or the nearest approximation thereof, consistent with the circumstances in each case. This right
is agencywide and applies for a period of 1 year from the date eligibility for compensation begins. After 1 year, the
individual is entitled to the rights accorded individuals who fully or partially recover, as applicable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Partially recovered
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Agencies must make every effort to restore, according to the circumstances in each case, an individual who has partially
recovered from a compensable injury and who is able to return to limited duty. At a minimum, this would mean treating
these employees substantially the same as other handicapped individuals under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as
amended. (See 29 U.S.C. 791(b) and 794.) If the individual fully recovers, he or she is entitled to be considered for
the position held at the time of injury, or an equivalent one. A partially recovered employee is expected to seek reemployment
as soon as he or she is able.

Status upon reemployment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An individual who is restored following a compensable injury is generally entitled to be treated as though he or she
had never left. This means that the entire period the employee was receiving compensation is creditable for purposes
of rights and benefits based upon length of service, including within-grade increases, career tenure, leave rate
accrual, and completion of probation. However, an injured employee enjoys no special protections in a reduction
in force. Separation by reduction in force or for cause while on compensation terminates entitlement to credit for
the subsequent period the individual continues to receive compensation, and also means the individual has no restoration
rights.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On August 22, 1994, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission published for comment a proposed rule on Radiological Criteria
for Decommissioning (59 FR 43200). Section 20.1406(b) of this proposed rule requires that a Site Specific Advisory
Board (SSAB) be convened in cases where a licensee proposes to request restricted release of the site. The objective
of this workshop is to conduct an informed discussion among affected interests on the implementation of this requirement.
The workshop will be facilitated by an independent facilitator and will involve approximately fifteen to twenty
invited participants representing a broad range of affected interests including, for example, government (local,
State, tribal, Federal), industry, and environmental and citizen groups. The workshop will be open to the public
with sufficient time being provided for public comment and questions throughout each day of the workshop. The workshop
proceedings will be transcribed and the transcript will be available for public review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An Issues Paper containing a detailed description of the SSAB implementation issues is being developed by the NRC
staff for use as a background discussion document for the workshop. This Issues paper will be distributed to participants
in advance of the workshop. A detailed agenda and list of participants for the workshop is also being developed for
distribution to participants in advance of the workshop. Copies of the Issues Paper, the Workshop Agenda, and the
list of workshop participants will be made available to the public at the workshop. Copies of these documents will
be placed in the NRC Public Document Room and will also be available for downloading and viewing on the NRC bulletin
board as described below.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In situations where a licensee proposes to decommission a site under restricted release conditions, proposed Section
20.1407 would require the licensee to establish a SSAB for the purpose of obtaining advice from affected interests
on the proposed decommissioning. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are many important issues related to the SSAB concept that must be further developed before the final rule is
promulgated to facilitate implementation of the SSAB concept at NRC licensed sites. These include determining the
exact scope and functions of an SSAB and the appointment and composition of an SSAB. A national workshop will be extremely
useful in developing information on how these issues should be addressed, as well as for developing the final NRC position
on the SSAB concept. The objective of the workshop will not be to develop a consensus on the implementation of an SSAB
but will rather be a discussion of information, ideas, and concerns about SSAB implementation issues, as well as identifying
areas of agreement and disagreement on the implementation issues.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On July 14, 1993, the FAA issued NPRM 93&hyph;71 (58 FR 38028), and the comment period closed November 12, 1993. The
NPRM proposed to amend the airworthiness standards for commuter category airplanes by upgrading the seat restraint
and seat cushion flammability requirements. On September 17, 1993, GAMA requested the FAA withdraw the proposal
until additional supporting documentation was made available to the public. By letter dated October 4, 1993, the
Joint Aviation Authority requested that the comment period be extended to enable the JAA Study Group additional time
to review the proposal and prepare a recommendation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA received an additional report on commuter airplane accident data analysis in October 1994. This report is
the additional information that GAMA requested be available before the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking was made available
to the public for comment.

Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In view of the possibility of obtaining additional technical information and to provide for a more consistent set
of airworthiness standards, the FAA agrees that it would be in the public's best interest to reopen the comment period.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is considering the establishment of a viticultural area in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State of California to be known as ``St. Helena.'' The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed area is located totally within Napa County. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal is the result of a petition submitted by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Charles A. Carpy, Chairman of the St. Helena Appellation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Committee. The establishment of viticultural areas and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsequent use of viticultural area names as appellations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
origin in wine labeling and advertising will help consumers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
better identify the wines they may purchase, and will help 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
winemakers distinguish their products from wines made in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other areas.

Background

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 23, 1978, ATF published Treasury Decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF-53 (43 FR 37672, 54624) revising regulations in 27 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 4. These regulations allow the establishment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definitive viticultural areas. The regulations allow the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
name of an approved viticultural area to be used as an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appellation of origin on wine labels and in wine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advertisements. On October 2, 1979, ATF published Treasury Decision ATF-60 (44 FR 56692) which added a new Part 9 to
27 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CFR, for the listing of approved American viticultural areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Section 4.25a(e)(1), Title 27 CFR, defines an American 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
viticultural area as a delimited grape-growing region 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distinguishable by geographical features, the boundaries of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which have been delineated in Subpart C of Part 9. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Section 4.25a(e)(2) outlines the procedure for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing an American viticultural area. Any interested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
person may petition ATF to establish a grape-growing region 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a viticultural area. The petition should include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (a) Evidence that the name of the proposed viticultural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area is locally and/or nationally known as referring to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area specified in the petition; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (b) Historical or current evidence that the boundaries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the viticultural area are as specified in the petition; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (c) Evidence relating to the geographical features 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(climate, soil, elevation, physical features, etc.) which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distinguish the viticultural features of the proposed area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from surrounding areas; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (d) A description of the specific boundaries of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
viticultural area, based on the features which can be found 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on United States Geological Survey (U.S.G.S.) maps of the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ATF has received a petition from Mr. Charles A. Carpy, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chairman of the St. Helena Appellation Committee, proposing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to establish a new viticultural area in Napa County, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California, to be known as ``St. Helena.'' The St. Helena 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appellation Committee is composed of various vineyard and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
winery owners located throughout the St. Helena area. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed St. Helena viticultural area is located 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately 16 miles northwest of the city of Napa. It is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
located totally within the larger and previously established 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Napa Valley viticultural area. As stated in the petition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the St. Helena viticultural area covers approximately 9,060 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acres, and is densely planted to vines. There are over 30 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wineries within the area. The petition provides the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following information as evidence that the proposed area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meets the regulatory requirements discussed previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Charles Sullivan, Napa Valley historian, has provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the petitioner with most of the historical information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerning the St. Helena area that is covered in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petition whereas Dr. Deborah Elliott-Fisk of the University 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of California has provided the petitioner with most of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information in the petition concerning soils, geology and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physical geography of the St. Helena area.

 Data prepared by Mr. Sullivan in support of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petition provides the following historical information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  The town of St. Helena was founded by Henry Still, who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bought land from the Edward Bale family in 1855. By 1858 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there was a school house and a little Baptist church. Four 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years later Professor William Brewer of the Whitney party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
called it a ``pretty little village with fifty or more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
houses *&blank;*&blank;* nestled among grand old oaks.'' Early winemakers in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the St. Helena area included Charles Krug and George Belden 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Crane. At the end of the 1879 vintage the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
San Francisco 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Post
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ran an article on northern California wines which noted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the flavor characteristics of Napa clarets. This article 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was copied by the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
St. Helena Star 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
which predicted that there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be 2,000 acres of grapes planted in the Napa Valley in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1880. According to Mr. Sullivan, the final total was closer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to 3,000, and concentrated in the St. Helena area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  As early as 1869, San Francisco's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Alta California
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
making reference to a ``St. Helena district,'' as did the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pacific Rural Press.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 These were references to vineyard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plantings in the area. In 1872 the Napa Reporter made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference to the boom in vineyard land around St. Helena. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Alta California 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ran an article on the area in 1878, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treating St. Helena as a specific district with a great 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reputation. By then Charles Krug, the Beringers, Crane, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
John Lewelling, H. A. Pellet, and 14 other producers had 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
built cellars in the St. Helena area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  In 1875 Krug and Pellet organized the producers and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
growers in the district, a move that culminated in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formation of the St. Helena Viticultural Club on January 22, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1876. According to Mr. Sullivan, others outside the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
district could join, but it was a local St. Helena 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organization. In 1880 the Club constructed Vintners Hall, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two story building with a reading room, meeting rooms, and a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
social hall upstairs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  Mr. Sullivan states that by the end of the 1870s there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was no question concerning Napa's special reputation as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
winegrowing region, or about St. Helena's as a discrete 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
district in that region. As support for this statement, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Sullivan cites the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Alta California 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
which concluded in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
article published in 1880 that ``Napa is now the leading 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wine-growing county of California, and *&blank;*&blank;* St. Helena has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
become the center of the most prosperous wine district in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  According to Mr. Sullivan, by the turn of the century 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Napa prices were still higher than those of other districts, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but the special position accorded St. Helena wines had 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ceased to exist. The popular image of the wines of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Oakville, Rutherford, Larkmead, and Howell Mountain had 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ended the perception of St. Helena wines standing above all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
others. After Prohibition, the regional association of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leading Napa Valley producers was far from foremost in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumers' minds and in the minds of wine writers according 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to Mr. Sullivan. However, Mr. Sullivan states that more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recently there has been a tendency for wine writers to make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference to the St. Helena ``district'' and to its wines, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particularly to its Cabernet Sauvignons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
  In addition to the historical name information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mentioned above, the ``St. Helena'' name appears on a U.S.G.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7.5 minute series map entitled ``St. Helena Quadrangle'' which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
includes the city of St. Helena and much of its surrounding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
According to the petition, there have never been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
precise historic boundaries for the St. Helena viticultural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
district. However, the petitioner states that history does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide an imprecise ``St. Helena District'' within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
geographic structure of State winegrowing established by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first Board of State Viticultural Commissioners in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1880s. According to the petition, the State was divided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into districts, one being Napa, which included Napa, Solano, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Contra Costa Counties. Charles Krug was the first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commissioner for the district in 1880. Napa County was then 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
divided into administrative districts: Napa (City), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Yountville, St. Helena, and Calistoga. According to the petition, these were not considered viticultural districts

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the time. The St. Helena District included the vineyards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Howell Mountain, most of Rutherford, and Larkmead. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is discussed in E.C. Priber's report to the Board in 1893. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even Chiles and Conn Valleys were included in the St. Helena 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
District, although Priber gave separate statistics for these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the wineries and vineyardists in the Priber 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report are listed in administrative districts, Priber's man 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the field, A. Warren Robinson, asked each where his or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
her operation was located, and the answer was given as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
place, not necessarily a post office. Bernard Ehlers said 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
he lived at Lodi Station. Mrs. Lillie Coit listed Larkmead. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the petitioner, such data make it possible to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make an attempt to draw historically accurate lines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner states that a more accurate listing of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
viticultural districts was given by Charles Krug in his 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report of 1887. In it he traces the development of each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
district in Napa County since 1881, by acreage, production, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and type of grape vines. Krug listed Yountville, Oakville, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rutherford, St. Helena, Spring Mountain, Howell Mountain, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Calistoga and five others. Although he did not include a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
map, the precision of his statistics indicates that he and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
others had the limits of these districts in mind. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From the information discussed above, the petitioner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has tried to plot the northern and southern boundaries of the St. Helena viticultural area. From a historical point

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of view, the petitioner states that any one of three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
landmarks could be used as the northern boundary of the St. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Helena viticultural area. These landmarks include Ritchie 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Creek, Bale Lane, and Big Tree Road. However, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petitioner feels that from a practical, as well as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
historical point of view, Bale Lane is the best choice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner states that the southern boundary of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
St. Helena viticultural area was discussed at length during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the December 9, 1992, ATF public hearing held in Napa, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California, concerning the northern boundary of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rutherford viticultural area. From the information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted at that hearing, it was determined that Zinfandel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Avenue, known locally as Zinfandel Lane, was the best 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
northern boundary for the Rutherford viticultural area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, the petitioner states that Zinfandel Avenue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Zinfandel Lane) should also be used as the southern 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boundary of the adjacent St. Helena viticultural area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner states that the southeast boundary of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the St. Helena appellation should include the Spring Valley 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area since this area was included in the St. Helena area on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 1895 ``Official Map of the County of Napa.'' On this map, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the properties of George Mee and Antonio Rossi (Spring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Valley) were listed as being in the St. Helena district 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whereas Charles Scheggia, just to the south, listed himself 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as being in Rutherford.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
According to the petitioner, the western boundary of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the St. Helena viticultural area is not strictly delineated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by historical custom. The petitioner states that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
western boundary should be dictated by the eastern boundary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the adjacent Spring Mountain District viticultural area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which utilizes the 400-foot contour line. The petitioner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
states that although some people might draw the western 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boundary of the St. Helena viticultural area at the 500 or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
600-foot contour line, the 400-foot contour line defies no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
historical precedent and prevents the overlapping of the St. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Helena viticultural area with the Spring Mountain District 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
viticultural area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In regard to the eastern boundary, the petitioner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
states that the historical records indicate that Conn Valley 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is a separate area and should not be included in the St. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Helena viticultural area. The records indicate, however, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that Pratt Valley is clearly part of the St. Helena area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the location of the Pratt and Chabot winegrowing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properties, according to the petitioner. In addition, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Crystal Springs Road area and Dago Valley should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included, according to the petitioner, due more to recent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developments there rather than earlier history. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the petitioner states that the old Rossini property, where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the historic Burgess-Souverain Winery is located today, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Leunenberger property, where the original Sutter Home-Ballantine Winery was located (today Deer Park Winery),

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should not be included because they are located on the lower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
slopes of Howell Mountain rather than in the St. Helena area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner uses mostly the 400-foot contour line 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and a short portion of Howell Mountain Road and a longer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portion of Conn Valley Road to delineate the eastern 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boundary of the proposed St. Helena viticultural area.

Data prepared by Dr. Elliott-Fisk in support of the

petition provides the following geographical information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Climate. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed St. Helena viticultural area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lies within a relatively narrow and constricted portion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the upper Napa Valley proper. There exists a subtle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interaction of climatic factors which affect grapes grown in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this valley floor area. These subtle climatic influences 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are part of a continuum across the entire floor of the Napa 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Valley. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Napa Valley proper is classified as a coastal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
valley. Along the valley floor from Napa to Calistoga, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there are pronounced mesoclimatic variations which relate to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the penetration of marine influences from San Pablo Bay and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to a lesser extent, to the rise in elevation as one proceeds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
up Napa Valley. This marine air incursion is caused by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warming of the valley floor and surrounding hillsides during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the daylight hours of the growing season. This warming land 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mass causes the air in the area to rise, creating pressure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gradients which draw in marine air off of San Pablo Bay to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the south. During the growing season, this phenomenon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally begins in the early afternoon and continues into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the evening. Due to proximity to the bay, the areas in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
southern portion of the valley receive the most direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact of these pressure gradient winds. These winds have a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooling effect throughout the Napa Valley. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the grape growing season, this cooling plays an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
important role in the development of the grapes by allowing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
them to better retain their natural acidity which is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical in the production of high quality wines, according 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the petitioner. In the proposed St. Helena viticultural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area, this cooling effect is moderated compared to the areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further south. However, while the St. Helena area has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relatively warm conditions, it is the daily maximum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extremes, for which the area to the north (Calistoga) is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
better known, that distinguish the St. Helena and Calistoga 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Traditionally, the dividing line between the area of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Calistoga's higher daily extremes and St. Helena's warm 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coastal climate has been the section of land around Bale 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lane. It is at this point that the Napa Valley and Napa River take a pronounced directional change of course from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
north/northwesterly to more westerly. To the north of Bale 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lane, the exposure of the valley floor to the sun also is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more directly aligned than to the south where there is more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shading. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The area to the north of the proposed St. Helena 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
viticultural area, particularly around the city of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Calistoga, is also affected by a secondary marine air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incursion, far less dramatic than that off of San Pablo Bay, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which penetrates the upper Napa Valley through the Knights 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Valley area. This marine influence, according to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petitioner, does not typically penetrate as far south as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
St. Helena viticultural area. When present, these moist, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooling winds serve to moderate the generally hotter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperatures in Calistoga, making this area ideal for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
growing premium wine grapes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dr. Elliott-Fisk also finds that there are significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
climatic differences between the St. Helena viticultural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area and the surrounding mountains. To the east of St. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Helena lies Howell Mountain and to the west is Spring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mountain. These mountain areas range in elevation from 400 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to 2,600 feet for Spring Mountain and from 1,400 to 2,400 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
feet for Howell Mountain. On average, temperatures fall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
along the valley floor approximately 2.8 degrees Fahrenheit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for each 1,000 foot fall in elevation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The mountain areas with south or southwest slopes, such as those generally found in the Howell Mountain viticultural
area, receive approximately 20 percent more solar radiation during the growing season compared to the valley floor.
Northeast and northwest slopes, such as those that typically occur in the Spring Mountain District viticultural
area, receive approximately 20 percent less solar radiation than those found on the valley floor in the proposed St.
Helena viticultural area. In addition to these differences related to aspect, the relative absence of fog in the higher
altitudes increases the solar radiation there compared to the valley floor which often is covered by early morning
fog. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the petitioner, precipitation has been more important in the formation of topography and soils in the
Napa Valley than in the definition of distinct climate zones. Outside of annual physiological water needs which are
almost exclusively augmented by irrigation, precipitation directly affects grape vines during late spring and
early fall, which are the critical periods of the growing and harvest seasons. Cooler areas, those generally found
to the south of the St. Helena appellation, are more negatively affected by such conditions.

Soils, Geology, and Physical Geography
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed St. Helena viticultural area is in the northern Napa Valley and is defined by the petitioner as the valley
floor area and lower mountain slopes (i.e., toe-slopes) from Zinfandel Lane in the south to Bale Lane in the north.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to Dr. Elliott-Fisk, the geology of the St. Helena area is characterized by steep mountain fronts composed
of the (1) Franciscan Formation (largely sandstones, mudstones and various metamorphic inclusions) overlain by
the moderate thicknesses of Sonoma Volcanics on the west side in the Mayacamas Range, and (2) deep flows of Sonoma Volcanics,
volcanic vents, and volcanic domes over Great Valley sandstones on the east side in the Vaca Range. Both mountain slopes
have been faulted and heavily eroded, with much of this activity believed to be synonymous with the formation of the
Sonoma Volcanics in the last 2-5 million years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dr. Elliott-Fisk further states that the topography of the Napa Valley floor is largely the product of (1) the marine
incursion of San Pablo Bay, and consequent marine erosion and deposit, (2) tectonic uplift and land displacement
along faults and fold structures (e.g., anticlines), (3) bedrock resistance to erosion, (4) slope stability, and
(5) discharge volumes of the Napa River and its tributaries. The proposed St. Helena viticultural area, extending
from Bale Lane on the north to Zinfandel Lane on the south, has a fairly uniform, steep gradient (as compared to the entire
Napa Valley floor), indicating that it is a zone of erosion of a former more powerful Napa River. The valley in this area
is narrow and is almost entirely the product of river erosion, unlike any other stretch of the valley floor. The one
break in gradient occurs where the river turns southward near Big Tree Road (just south of Bale Lane) and exerts more
force to cut through bedrock. Thus, although alluvial fans extend across the valley floor from their tributary canyons
to the Napa River, the fans are small and relatively young compared to the rest of Napa Valley. Sulphur Creek fan is the
largest of the group, as it issues from a very large drainage basin. Fans of the eastern side of the proposed appellation
are very small, largely due to the resistance of obsidian (i.e., volcanic glass) bedrock here and small tributary
basin size. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The topographic uniformity of the proposed St. Helena viticultural area is further substantiated by climatological
data and bioclimatic maps. Growing degree-days (i.e., temperature regime), according to Dr. Elliott-Fisk, are
very uniform along this stretch of the valley floor and lower slopes, averaging just under 3600 degree-days. Mean
annual precipitation is 35-38 inches. Just north of the proposed northern boundary of the St. Helena viticultural
area (e.g., around Dunaweal Lane), the vegetation changes from Valley Oak Savanna to Mixed Hardwood Woodland. These
gradients of climate and vegetation from south to north up Napa Valley, according to the petitioner, further support
the designation of viticultural areas, as climate is an important factor influencing vine growth and fruit characteristics,
with natural vegetation telling the viticulturalist what vine production will be like.

Soils and Geomorphology of the Napa Valley 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Dr. Elliott-Fisk states that soils can be consistently identified and mapped in Napa Valley through knowledge of
the geomorphology (i.e., landforms and landform history) of the area. These soil differences are relevant viticulturally
and can be used in the delimitation of viticultural areas. This soil and geomorphic mapping, which is based on very
detailed field and laboratory studies, produces soil units that are similar to those shown in the Napa County Soil
Survey (USDA-Soil Conservation Survey), but with more detail, precision, and most importantly, a different classification
scheme, according to the petitioner. The resolution of the mapping of Napa Valley's soils has increased from the 1938
survey (and the old Marbut soil classification scheme) to the newer 1977 survey (using the new 7th Approximation system
of soil classification) to a more detailed depiction of Napa Valley's soils based on an increased understanding of
(1) the geomorphological history of the Napa Valley, and (2) the importance of soil parent material and time as soil-forming
factors. There are many more soil types (or potential soil series) in Napa County than the Napa County Soil Survey depicts
according to the petitioner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dr. Elliott-Fisk further notes that a geomorphic (landscape) surface of a given age will have soils of the same type
across it. This is because soil formation is controlled by five factors (known as the soil-forming factors): climate,
biota (plants and animals), parent material, relief (topography) and time. The petitioner states that much of the
variation of soil types in Napa County is due to variation in the parent material and time factors. Different soil types
will be derived from sedimentary bedrock versus volcanic bedrock, whether or not these soils are upland residual
soils (with weathering and soil formation in place or 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in situ
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) or transportation/depositional soils (with soil formation beginning once river or other sediments are deposited).
Alluvial soils of different ages (old versus young) will also differ significantly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On any particular geomorphic surface (such as the Sulphur Creek fan), the parent material, relief and time factors
are held constant, with the soils very similar (if not identical) across this surface. For depositional landforms
(e.g., mudflow lobes, river terraces, alluvial fan units, etc.), the older deposits will have more strongly formed
soils. If a geomorphic surface is disturbed by erosion or deposition, its soil will be altered (if not destroyed),
with a new soil then forming. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In Napa Valley, distinct differences are seen between hillside soils and valley floor soils, at least in most situations.
Hillside soils tend to be formed from bedrock and are shallow, whereas valley floor soils tend to be formed from alluvium,
colluvium or bay deposits and are often deep. As Napa Valley has been tectonically active, however, these deeper,
depositional soils are occasionally found up on the hillsides, uplifted above the valley floor. It is important to
separate these depositional hillside soils from residual bedrock soils. They have much higher water-holding capacities
and deeper rooting depths, influencing vine growth significantly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dr. Elliott-Fisk further indicates that the floor of Napa Valley (excluding the bedrock ``islands'' which form small
hills) has soils formed on (1) alluvial fans of various lithologies, textures, and sizes emerging from tributary
watersheds towards the Napa River, (2) alluvial floodplains of various ages along the Napa River and the lower reaches
of its tributaries (such as Sulphur Creek), and (3) bay deposits of various types, formed when San Pablo Bay extended
into the valley proper. The alluvial fans in particular show marked contrasts in soil types north-south and east-west
in the valley as a function of their (1) watershed or drainage basin geology and (2) stream gradient (i.e., topography).
Dr. Elliott-Fisk concludes that the soils scientist then expects to find one soil series on fans derived from sedimentary
bedrock and another on fans derived from volcanic bedrock.

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Dr. Elliott-Fisk notes that the geomorphic depositional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
units (i.e., landforms) in the proposed St. Helena 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
viticultural area are composed almost exclusively of volcanic lithologies (around 85&hyph;90 percent volcanics

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
typically, occasionally dropping to 70 percent on parts of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Sulphur Creek fan, with the remainder sedimentary and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
metamorphic inclusions from the bedrock underlying the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sonoma Volcanics). The upper part of the Sulphur Creek 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Basin contains small units of sandstone and metamorphic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lithologies exposed at the surface through faulting and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
slope failure. Despite this, volcanic rhyolitic tuff, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rhyolite, dacite and andesite are by far the dominant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surficial geologies, compared to the Bear Canyon Fan Complex 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the south which is 30 percent or less volcanics and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remainder sedimentary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Dr. Elliott-Fisk further observes that although several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
types of volcanic rocks compose the St. Helena hillside, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most widespread (and as such, ubiquitous) units are volcanic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ash-flows, referred to as tuffs, with occasional volcanic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mudflows. The matrix is rhyolitic in composition, with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporated clasts of obsidian, rhyolite, andesite, dacite 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and tuff. Occasional metamorphic clasts of cobble or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smaller size are seen. This geologic parent material is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
slightly acidic to acidic, with water-holding capacity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tuffaceous bedrock units moderate. This potential soil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parent material is brought down both slopes to the west and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
east of the valley floor by hillside erosion, runoff, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tributary streamflow. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 According to Dr. Elliott-Fisk, the Napa River has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incised through these fan deposits discharging on the valley 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
floor and migrated as a consequence of the resistance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these deposits versus its own stream power. The Napa River 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
floodplain, and its associated recent terraces, varies in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
width throughout this section of Napa Valley but has formed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
important terraces along the eastern valley edge. Distinct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
breaks in the natural vegetation are seen at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terrace/alluvial fan transition, as the terraces have more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fertile soils with a greater water-holding capacity. As the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
width of the valley floor in the St. Helena area is on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average less (e.g., more narrow) than anywhere else in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Napa Valley, these terraces form less viticultural acreage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than in the southern or middle sections of Napa Valley. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The lower hillside slopes below the 400-foot elevation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are difficult to map on a broad scale depicting geomorphic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surfaces. This is largely a function of abrupt changes in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
slope angle and vegetation type, which influence long-term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
slope stability. Small areas of uplifted depositional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surfaces (alluvial fans and stream floodplain terraces) were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found across these lower slopes in the proposed St. Helena 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area, however.

Soils of the Proposed St. Helena Viticultural Area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With regard to the soils within the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
viticultural area, Dr. Elliott-Fisk states that the Sonoma 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Volcanics rim all sides of the valley in the St. Helena area, and as such the depositional valley floor soils (which

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be very bouldery deposits across alluvial fans or finer, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but still gravelly deposits along the Napa River proper, all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principally Xerolls) are volcanic in origin, and deep, very 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gravelly sandy loams to sandy clay loams to clay loams, with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
low to moderate water holding capacities. Sediments have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been transported relatively short distances from their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
origins, as this is the headwater area of the Napa River 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system, and as such the soils contain a higher percentage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coarse clasts (especially boulders), with sand dominating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fine fraction of almost every soil. Dr. Elliott-Fisk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notes that small sections of the upper stream basins of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sulphur Canyon and the Spring Mountain region contain the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
massive Franciscan marine sandstone and conglomerate, with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its affiliated volcanic and metamorphic inclusions. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lithology of the fine clasts that compose the alluvial fans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in this immediate region (i.e., Sulphur Creek fan) include a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher portion of non-volcanic clasts (up to 15 percent, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occasionally 30 percent) than alluvial fans to the north, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such as the Ritchie Creek fan below Diamond Mountain, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
located largely north of the proposed northern St. Helena 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
viticultural area boundary. However, the percentage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-volcanic clasts is much higher to the south of the St. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Helena viticultural area (i.e., Bear Canyon fan). The lower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toe-slopes of the mountain slopes in the St. Helena area (below the 400-foot elevation) contain both Xerolls and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Xeralfs, depending on slope stability and age. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Dr. Elliott-Fisk states that she has excavated an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional 17 soil trenches in the process of her scientific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigation in this area. She states that she has done 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previous soils work in this region and has excavated over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
350 soil trenches in Napa Valley. She has provided, as part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the petition, profile drawings, descriptive field, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analytical laboratory data for 17 soils by horizon. Four of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these soils are from property outside of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boundaries of the St. Helena viticultural area and were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chosen to be representative of those areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Soil Summary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The soils of the proposed St. Helena viticultural area, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
according to the petition, are deep alluvial soils of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moderate age, with well-formed horizonation, textural B 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
horizons, sandy clay loam to clay loam textures, reddish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
colors, high gravel content (primarily of cobbles), and near 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neutral pH. In this erosional zone of the valley floor, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where the width is restricted, groundwater and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
groundwater table have a significant influence, bringing in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional dissolved minerals and increasing the pH (and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nutritional content) above the valley floor soils to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
north (Calistoga region) and south (Rutherford and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Oakville), as well as the hillsides (Spring Mountain, Diamond Mountain, Howell Mountain and Pritchard Hill). The

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
soil drainage in the St. Helena area is typically good since 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the water table drops in the spring, summer and fall to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allow the vines an adequate root zone with free oxygen and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carbon dioxide, thus providing vigorous conditions for grape 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
growing. The moderate climate, with warm summer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature, balances well with this soil environment, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allows the wine grower to manipulate the vines to extract 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
what the winemaker desires from a particular varietal. As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such, Dr. Elliott-Fisk concludes that this provides a stable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and predictable environment for grape growing, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physical geography of the region has promoted the production 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of fine wines in the St. Helena area for many decades.

Conclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
According to the petitioner, the proposed St. Helena 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
viticultural area is uniform topographically and can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distinguished from the steeper hillsides to the east (Howell 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mountain) and west (Spring Mountain District) as well as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the valley floor areas to the south (Rutherford) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
north (Calistoga). This is an area where the valley floor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
narrows from around 19,000 feet at Oakville Cross Road and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11,000 feet at Zinfandel Lane to around 3,500 feet at Lodi 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lane and Bale Lane. The area is marked by a uniform, steep 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gradient and significant river erosion. The bedrock geology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is primarily volcanic, in contrast to the sedimentary soils 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the south.

Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is hereby certified that this proposed regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of small entities. The establishment of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
viticultural area is neither an endorsement nor approval by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF of the quality of wine produced in the area, but rather 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an identification of an area that is distinct from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surrounding areas. ATF believes that the establishment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
viticultural areas merely allows wineries to more accurately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
describe the origin of their wines to consumers, and helps 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumers identify the wines they purchase. Thus, any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefit derived from the use of a viticultural area name is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the result of the proprietor's own efforts and consumer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptance of wines from that region. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required because the proposal, if promulgated as a final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule, is not expected (1) to have significant secondary, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incidental effects on a substantial number of small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities; or (2) to impose, or otherwise cause a significant

compliance burdens on a substantial number of small entities.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 10, 1994 (59 FR 40855), the Coast Guard proposed to amend the rules, on standards for damage stability, that
it adopted on December 10, 1992. Amended rules are necessary to relieve certain vessels of an unforeseen regulatory
burden. The proposed rules would relieve those vessels of that burden and yet minimize the potential for capsizing
and other casualties caused by inadequate damage stability. To obtain further information from members of the regulated
community and the general public, the Coast Guard will conduct a second public meeting and re-open the comment period
on the amended rules.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Request for Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The comment period for the amended rules is being extended to allow sufficient time for the public to review the report
of the Department of Transportation Volpe Transportation Systems Center on the effect of the new damage stability
rules on the domestic passenger vessel fleet. This detailed analysis of twenty-one domestic vessel designs was released
in late September 1994, and a copy has been placed in this docket. Information on obtaining a copy of this report may
be obtained by contacting the person listed above under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice extends the period for submission of comments on the proposed changes to 46 CFR 171.080(e) described in
the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking published on August 10, 1994 (59 FR 40855). It is the Coast Guard's goal to implement
regulations that will best address both the safety and the operational needs of all vessels. These standards were
based on one developed by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) for any passenger vessel allowed to carry
12 or more passengers on an international voyage (under a ``SOLAS Passenger Ship Certificate'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard again seeks advice from owners and operators of vessels and shipyards, and from naval architects,
its own inspectors, classification societies' inspectors, consumers, crews of vessels, and others involved in
the affected vessels' compliance with &sect;171.080(e) as this proposed rule would amend it. Interested persons
are invited and encouraged to participate by submitting written data views and arguments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons submitting comments should include their names and addresses, identify this notice [CGD 94&hyph;010],
identify the specific paragraph of the section to which each comment applies, and include supporting documents or
sufficient detail to indicate the reason for each comment. The Coast Guard will acknowledge receipt of comments if
a stamped, self-addressed post card or envelope is enclosed with the comments.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard has determined that the opportunity to make further oral presentations will aid the rulemaking process
and will hold a second public meeting from 1:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. on December 1, 1994, in room 2415 of Coast Guard Headquarters,
Washington, DC 20593&hyph;0001. With advance notice, and as time permits, members of the public may make oral presentations
during the meeting. Persons wishing to make oral presentations should notify the person listed above under the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 7, 1994, the Federal Maritime Commission (``FMC'' or ``Commission'') published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
(``NPR'') (59 FR 16592) which proposed to amend its regulations governing financial reporting requirements and
rate of return methodology applicable to vessel-operating common carriers by water in the domestic offshore trades.
Among other things, the proposed rule would change the method of determining the reasonableness of a carrier's return
on rate base from the comparable earnings test to the weighted average cost of capital methodology. At the request
of Matson Navigation Company, the Commission extended the comment period for interested parties to file until July
20, 1994 (59 FR 27002). Seven parties filed comments on the NPR. Commenters include: American President Lines (``APL''),
Crowley Maritime Corporation (``Crowley''), Matson Navigation Company, Inc. (``Matson''), Puerto Rico Maritime
Shipping Authority (``PRMSA''), United States Department of Transportation (``DOT''), Marsoft Incorporated
(``Marsoft''), and the State of Hawaii (``Hawaii'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on its review of the comments, the Commission has determined that reply comments on four issues would be beneficial.
In order that the Commission have the most complete information available to enable it to make an informed judgment
in these matters, interested persons are invited to submit comments on the issues discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Issue 1: Calculation of the Cost of Capital
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
PRMSA addresses the issue of the calculation of the before-tax weighted average cost of capital (``BTWACC'') and
its relationship to the projected rate of return on rate base. PRMSA states that the formula for the BTWACC contained
in the proposed rule is correct.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 PRMSA asserts, however, that since the projected rate of return in the proposed rule is computed on an after-tax basis_with
return on rate base being computed by dividing net income plus interest expense by the trade rate base_the proposed
before-tax weighted average cost of capital is being compared to the after-tax projected return on rate base. PRMSA
suggests, therefore, that either the weighted average cost of capital should be changed to an after-tax basis so it
can be compared to the after-tax projected return on trade rate base currently specified, or the BTWACC should be retained
and the projected return on trade rate base should be changed to a before-tax basis.

PRMSA's comments appear to have merit. Therefore, the Commission is proposing to retain the before-tax weighted
average cost of capital contained in the proposed rule and change the calculation of the projected rate of return on
rate base to a before-tax basis. Retention of the BTWACC seems appropriate because it is employed by a large majority
of regulatory commissions. The before-tax weighted average cost of capital would be calculated as it is in the proposed
rule. However, the projected rate of return on rate base stated in the proposed rule would be changed to:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
that insurance expense be treated in the same manner as other operating expenses in calculating working capital,
i.e., include that amount applicable to the duration of an average voyage. In its comments on this proposed rule, Hawaii
suggests an additional modification of the calculation of working capital, namely, the exclusion of interest expense.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In support of its proposal, Hawaii states that interest expense is a source of working capital funds, and is not paid
to the bond holder until after related revenue is received. Hawaii concludes, therefore, that interest expense does
not create a need for working capital. Comments are requested on the validity of the proposal to exclude interest expense
from the calculation of working capital.

Issue 3: The Selection of Proxy Groups
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of parties commented on the selection of the proxy group. Hawaii indicates a concern with the criteria prescribed
in selecting a comparable group of companies when the proxy group is used in determining the cost of common-stock equity.
Hawaii believes that the companies in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Value Line Investment Survey 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
which satisfy the Commission's criteria for the proxy group do not have business risks similar to those of Matson.
Hawaii claims that these companies are generally consolidated companies; are not dominant in their trades; and do
not have statutory barriers to entry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Marsoft states that according to its research only three marine transportation companies and four trucking companies
meet the proposed guidelines for the proxy group. Marsoft does not believe that airlines, railroads, or full-load
trucking companies should be included in the proxy group, because they do not provide comparable services. Marsoft
states that in many cases large, geographically and operationally diverse companies will be compared to small, highly
specialized private carriers. Marsoft believes that the comparison may not be credible in some cases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PRMSA comments that the proxy group should not be restricted to the freight transportation business. PRMSA asserts
that equity capital in the regulated carrier competes against the broad spectrum of companies in the economy, not
just against companies involved in freight transportation. The nature of a business is said to be only one ingredient
of business risk, not the sole determinant. PRMSA notes that as of June 1994, there were a total of 39 companies listed
in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Value Line Investment Survey 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
which were involved in air transport, trucking, maritime, and railroading. Allegedly, not all of these companies
were involved in freight transportation as required by the proposed rule. PRMSA concludes from this that the potential
list of comparable companies is highly limited.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed rule, the proxy group is selected from companies which operate and derive a major portion of their
gross revenues primarily as common carriers in the business of freight transportation, and own and operate transportation
vehicles or vessels. The Commission requests specific suggestions on industries other than freight transportation
covered by the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
which have business and financial risks similar to those of the domestic carriers that may be added to the current proxy
group criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Issue 4: Deletion of Alternative Methodologies
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule revises paragraph (b) of section 552.1 by deleting the provision that the methodology employed
in each case will depend on the nature of the relevant carrier's operations and financial structure. Also, the proposed
rule adds language to that paragraph that specifies the extent of possible alternative methodologies. Paragraph
(b) reads:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) In evaluating the reasonableness of a VOCC's overall level of rates, the Commission will use return on rate base
as its primary standard. A carrier's allowable rate of return on rate base will be set equal to its before-tax weighted
average cost of capital. However, the Commission may also employ the other financial methodologies set forth in &sect;552.6(f)
in order to achieve a fair and reasonable result.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (d) of the same section has been deleted. That paragraph provided that the Commission may use some other
basis for allocation and calculation and may consider other operational factors in any instance where it is deemed
necessary to achieve a fair and reasonable result.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
APL informs that these provisions are at the heart of a major dispute in FMC Docket No. 89&hyph;26, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Government of the Territory of Guam, et al. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sea-Land Service, Inc. and American President Lines, Ltd. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It points out that the NPR does not give any reasons for the proposed changes to section 552.1 and contends that the changes
cannot be legally adopted unless and until the FMC identifies its reasons for such a change and allows opportunity
for comment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the abbreviated comments it did provide, APL contends that the proposed changes can have no substantive effect
on a pending complaint docket focused on a prior time period. APL further urges the Commission to ``make clear, as a
general matter, that its decision in the prospective rulemaking proceeding is not intended to pre-judge issues in
the retrospective complaint proceeding.'' APL contends that sections 552.1(b) and 552.1(d) merely make explicit
an agency's authority that is implicit in any regulatory scheme. Further, APL questions why the FMC would want to amend
a regulation in a way that might imply that it was denying itself the ability to do something necessary to achieve a fair
and reasonable result.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Guam trade is unique in that the trade is a very small portion of the carriers' overall service. However, whether
the current method of allocation is appropriate in such a case need not be decided here, because the two carriers serving
Guam, APL and Sea-Land Service, Inc., currently file most, if not all, of their rates with the Interstate Commerce
Commission. Neither carrier files full financial reports under 46 CFR Part 552. In the event an FMC-regulated carrier
initiates such a service in the future, the Commission will address the need for any change in 46 CFR Part 552 in a separate
rulemaking proceeding. Paragraph (d) was eliminated because the Commission did not want such determinations to
be made on an 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ad hoc
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 basis during a rate investigation. It is essential that significant issues relating to the underlying methodology
to be employed in determining the reasonableness of rates be settled prior to any rate investigation. The 180-day
limit specified by section 3 of the Shipping Act, 1933, 46 U.S.C. app. 845, cannot be met if parties are permitted to
change methodologies during the course of a rate case. Moreover, it is unfair; parties to a rate proceeding are entitled
to rely on the Commission's rules. They should not have to respond to ever-changing methodologies proposed by other
parties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is understandable that APL is concerned that the Commission's decision here may affect the outcome in Docket No.
89&hyph;26. However, any changes that may be made to Part 552 as a result of this proceeding will only be applied prospectively.
They will have no application in pending cases such as Docket No. 89&hyph;26.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fauna and Flora (CITES or Convention) regulates international trade in certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
animals and plants. Species for which trade is controlled are listed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendices I, II, and III to CITES. The United States as a Party to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Convention may (1) propose amendments to the appendices for consideration by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the other Parties at the biennial meetings of the Conference of the Parties, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) submit topics for inclusion in the agenda of these meetings, and (3) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submit resolutions to improve the implementation of the Convention for

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fauna and Flora, hereinafter referred to as CITES or the Convention, is an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
international treaty designed to control and regulate international trade in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain animal and plant species which are or may become threatened with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extinction, and are listed in Appendices to the Convention. Currently, 122 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
countries, including the United States, are CITES Parties. The Convention 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calls for biennial meetings of the Conference of the Parties that review its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation, make provisions enabling the CITES Secretariat in Switzerland 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to carry out its functions, consider amendments to the list of species in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendices I and II, consider reports presented by the Secretariat, and make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendations for the improved effectiveness of the Convention. COP9 will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be held in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, November 7&hyph;18, 1994.

Public Comments and Decisions on Possible Species Proposals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Decisions about suggested U.S. proposals discussed in the previous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice of January 27, 1994 (59 FR 3832) are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Species Proposals Not Submitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Narwhal (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Monodon monoceros
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed that the narwhal be transferred from Appendix II to Appendix I of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CITES. The range of the narwhal is circumpolar in Arctic waters, mostly north 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 65 degrees North Latitude, although it occurs in greater densities in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waters north of the Atlantic than in waters north of the Pacific Ocean. There 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is some north-south seasonal movement in response to climate and ice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development. Between Canada and Greenland, narwhals summer in high densities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the eastern Canadian Arctic and off northwest Greenland, with smaller 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
summering groups occurring in many other locations. Narwhals also occur in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some concentration along the east coast of Greenland. There is evidence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggesting that the populations on the east and west coasts of Greenland 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
belong to separate stocks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three populations of narwhals were reviewed in 1992 by the Small Cetacean 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sub-Committee of the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commission (IWC): (1) Hudson Bay, including northern Hudson Bay and western 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hudson Strait; (2) Baffin Bay, including the eastern Canadian Arctic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Archipelago and western Greenland; and (3) East Greenland and the Barents Sea. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Hudson Bay stock has been conservatively estimated at 1300 animals. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Small Cetacean Sub-Committee estimated the Baffin Bay stock at 27,580 to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
42,520. No good estimates are available for the East Greenland/Barents Sea 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population, although it is considerably smaller than the other stocks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Relatively small numbers of narwhals are reported from other parts of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species' range. Because of the difficulty in surveying narwhals, most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
abundance estimates for the species have large variances and require careful 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interpretation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Narwhals are hunted for maktag (blubber/skin), meat, and their tusks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Maktag is consumed by the Inuit, and meat is (or has been in the past) used as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dog food, although both commodities are also sold on a limited basis. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tusks are utilized domestically for carving, and are sold as souvenirs, either 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as carved products or as intact tusks. (Females only occasionally develop 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tusks.) The majority of tusks taken in Canadian waters apparently remain in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the country, while the bulk of narwhal ivory taken in Greenland is shipped to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Denmark (perhaps as much as 90 percent annually) where much is exported to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other countries in the European Union (EU). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1976, Canada imposed quotas on the take of narwhals, which it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulates by issuing tags to be affixed to each animal taken. Tusks from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these animals that enter trade must have the tag attached to show that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
animal from which it was removed was legally taken under the quota system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Greenland Home Rule Government sets no quotas for narwhals and no tracking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
except for those animals that enter international trade, and, therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require CITES permits. Since 1985 Greenland has not been a member of the EU, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore a no detriment finding is necessary for the issuance of CITES export 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permits by the Greenland Home Rule Government, and for import permits by EU 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
countries under EU regulations, even though the narwhal is an Appendix II 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species. However, Greenland sets restrictions on who is allowed to hunt and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the manner in which hunts are conducted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eight comments were received during the comment period, five favoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amending the listing of narwhal from Appendix II to Appendix I, and three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opposed to this change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Society for Animal Protective Legislation (SAPL), The Humane Society 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the United States (HSUS), the American Humane Association (AHA), the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Defenders of Wildlife (Defenders), and EIA all expressed support for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix I listing of the narwhal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The HSUS indicated that Canada and Greenland continue to hunt narwhals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and export tusks in large numbers (Greenland being the largest exporter), and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the annual net trade in tusks nearly doubled from 1985&hyph;1990. (Prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1985 when Greenland began issuing its own CITES export permits, the movement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of tusks from Greenland to Denmark was not considered international trade, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore pre- and post-1985 trade figures cannot be compared equally). They 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also state that trade figures do not reflect the total numbers of narwhals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taken because for each actual take there are three to four injured or killed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
animals lost. Even though information is limited, HSUS believe that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reproductive rates among narwhals is low, and that in 1981 the world 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population was estimated at approximately 20,000 animals and declining. HSUS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asserted that narwhals should be listed in Appendix I as a precautionary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measure because status information is limited, information on reproduction and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
natural mortality is lacking, and information on actual numbers hunted is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unavailable.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The AHA indicated that new export markets have caused narwhal ivory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prices to increase in Canada following a price decline in the mid-1980's, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which has returned ivory prices to about the same prices as existed in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
early 1980's. This increase in the price of narwhal ivory prices has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested that ivory rather than maktag and meat has become the basis of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modern hunting in eastern Canada. AHA noted that take quotas have not been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposed by Greenland, and that there are no controls on trade in ivory. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, as previously mentioned, since 1985 a no detriment finding is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary for the issuance of CITES export permits by Greenland and for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
import permit by Denmark. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Defenders also asserted that the prime motivation for the take of narwhal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in recent years has been the ivory, stimulated by new export markets and a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resurgence in the price of ivory since the mid-1980's, which has biased take 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the adult males. They feel that this could jeopardize narwhal population 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
structure by the removal of a larger number of males. They contended that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current CITES listing of the narwhal in Appendix II does not provide adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring of take because there is not a substantial domestic market for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
narwhal tusks in Canada, and yet export permits were issued for fewer than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
half the tusks obtained in Canadian narwhal hunts between 1975 and 1990. From 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this, Defenders concluded that a large number of tusks must have been exported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without CITES permits, but presented no evidence for this conclusion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, due to the uncertainty and concern surrounding the catch levels of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
narwhals for the ivory market, Defenders supported an Appendix I listing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EIA submitted comments that supported their original proposal that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the narwhal be included in Appendix I. They provided an estimate of 28,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
narwhal in the combined Canada-Greenland High Arctic population. They 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussed the utilization of maktag and meat, the demand for narwhal ivory in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Canada, and the export of Greenland ivory to Denmark and on into the EU. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decline in ivory prices of the early 1980's has, according to EIA, now 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned to about those same levels. EIA pointed out the absence of quotas on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
take of narwhal in Greenland, suggested that the application of quotas in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Canada is inadequate, and that the number of narwhal taken does not reflect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actual take numbers because of the loss of wounded or killed animals before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they are landed. They also pointed out the difficulty of assessing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relationship between the market demand for ivory and hunting intensity. EIA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believed that additional information on life history, distribution, abundance, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and hunting loss rates was needed to assess the stocks and the impacts of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trade in the various parts derived from narwhal in order to properly manage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the stocks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Greenland Home Rule Government and the Fisheries Agency of Japan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(FAJ) objected to transferring the narwhal to Appendix I. Greenland did not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agree that narwhals should be placed in Appendix I due to unsustainable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hunting pressures caused by the international trade in narwhal ivory. They 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
argued that recent population estimates did not adequately take into account 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submerged whales, which would give corrected estimates sufficient to sustain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hunting pressures greater than current harvest levels. They also maintained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that low levels of ivory export reported for Greenland before 1985 are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
partially an artifact of the change in their political designation at that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time, prior to which the shipment of ivory to Denmark was not considered as an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
export. They noted that, even though there are no catch quotas for Greenland, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there are strict regulations on catch reporting, vessel sizes, etc., and that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there are two reserve areas in Greenland waters where narwhal are protected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generally, the FAJ felt that a listing in Appendix I should be based only on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scientific evidence that there is a threat to extinction and that trade 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control is necessary for the protection of the species. Furthermore, the FAJ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noted that the narwhal is already in Appendix II, providing some control of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trade and a mechanism for collecting trade data, and that in the absence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new information indicating a deterioration in the status of the species there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is no need for consideration of a change to Appendix I. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Government of Canada also does not agree with an Appendix I proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the narwhal. They feel that recent estimates of the Canadian High Arctic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stocks are low by as much as 50 percent due to an underestimation of the time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
narwhals spend under water (as indicated in the 1992 Report of the Sub- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Committee on Small Cetaceans of the International Whaling Commission), and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that this larger population size can sustain current catch levels. They also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
feel that their catch quotas are adequate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The U.S. Marine Mammal Commission (MMC) does not support an Appendix I 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listing for the narwhal at this time, but noted that Canada and Greenland 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be encouraged to obtain additional and better information on the status 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and trends of narwhal stocks, and on harvest levels (particularly regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
animals that are struck and lost during hunting).

In developing its position, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) took note of the continuing question about
the sustainability of the take of narwhal, particularly noting the difficulties in obtaining data, such as population
levels, catch levels and loss rates, and in obtaining trade data for narwhals. Because of this uncertainty, NMFS decided
not to recommend that the United States propose this species for Appendix I. The Service assessed all information
available and concluded that there was no sufficient information to support listing this species in Appendix I. The
United States will continue to monitor information on this species as it becomes available in order to better assess
possible recommendations at a later date.

species). The EIA requested that the Service propose including all species in the genus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Moschus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in Appendix I. There are at least four species in the genus, which is widely distributed across eastern and central
Asia. Currently all 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Moschus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
species are included in Appendix II except those populations in Afghanistan, Bhutan, Burma, India, Nepal, and Pakistan,
which are included in Appendix I. Musk deer were listed in the Appendices due to the trade in musk, a substance taken
from the musk gland of the male and used in traditional medicines in Asia and in the manufacture of perfumes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Five comments were received in response to the January 27, 1994, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
notice. Four commenters (including SAPL) favored the transfer of all Appendix II populations of musk deer to Appendix
I. TRAFFIC USA, while neither supporting nor opposing an Appendix I listing, relayed information from TRAFFIC France
that the French perfume industry is using a synthetic musk in some cases, but that France continues to import 5 to 15
kilograms of musk per year, primarily from the Russian Federation. The AHA suggested that musk deer ``farming'' operations
in China are inadequate to satisfy demands for musk, and that the existence of a legal musk trade creates a loophole
for illegal trade. Defenders and HSUS reiterated this claim. The AHA stated that current levels of exploitation of
musk deer in Russia, China and the Himalayas are reported to be unsustainable. Defenders reported that the price of
musk in Hong Kong can be as high as US$84,000 to US$119,000 per kilogram. They also indicated that there is not much information
available on population numbers of musk deer, but that it is known that illegal and undocumented trade in musk is occurring.
They state that, ``Estimates indicate that some populations have been halved during the past five years due to uncontrolled
hunting,'' but no specific information or documented reports were provided. The HSUS noted the high cost of musk,
and stated that this has led to wide-scale poaching of musk deer. They also reported that an 80 percent decline has occurred
in one population of musk deer in Russia. The HSUS claimed that in China musk deer populations are declining rapidly
due to over-exploitation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments received provided little additional or substantive information on the distribution and status of musk
deer, or on international trade in musk, aside from anecdotal reports of increased poaching and the high cost of musk.
The People's Republic of China claims that there are 500,000 to 1 million musk deer in China, and plans a comprehensive
survey. Russia indicated there are about 150,000 musk deer in Russia, and harvests are not allowed in areas where populations
are decreasing. In Russia, musk deer are protected in 18 reserves and other federal and local preserves, and the Sakhalin
musk deer is listed in the Red Data Book. Based on these protective measures, the Russian Management Authority felt
that it is premature to amend the listing of the musk deer to Appendix I. Mongolia provided conflicting remarks; they
indicated support for an Appendix I listing of the musk deer in their cover letter, but in their attached discussion
of the species they stated that the Mongolian musk deer should be kept in Appendix II. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service does not believe that population or trend data are sufficient to support a proposal to transfer the Appendix
II populations of musk deer to Appendix I, and did not submit such a proposal.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Nerodia erythrogaster
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The Service has proposed to list the northern subspecies of the copperbelly water snake, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
N. e. neglecta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act, 58 FR 43860 (August 18, 1993). The species is restricted
to the lower Ohio River Valley and the lower Wabash River Valley in Indiana, Illinois and Kentucky, and in southern
Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio. There have been recent population declines and it now exists in isolated pockets of suitable
habitat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only the HSUS provided comments, and supported the listing of the species in Appendix II. Although the proposed rule
suggested that removal from the wild by amateur collectors posed some threat to this species, no additional information
on trade in the species was received, and existing reports of international trade are several years old. Therefore,
on the basis of this record the Service is not persuaded that the available information on trade would warrant a proposal
to include this species in Appendix II. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Bluefin tuna (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Thunnus thynnus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The Service received a draft proposal from ICCAT Watch, a coalition consisting of the National Audubon Society
(NAS), the Center for Marine Conservation (CMC), and the World Wildlife Fund- US (WWF-US), to list the bluefin tuna
throughout the Atlantic Ocean on Appendix II and additionally, the western Atlantic population on Appendix I. Later,
ICCAT Watch withdrew its request to list the western Atlantic population in Appendix I.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice gave current information about the Atlantic bluefin tuna including management by the International Commission
on the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), recent stock assessments for the western and eastern stocks, recent
estimates of fishing mortality rates, reductions in harvest quotas recommended at the 1993 Regular Meeting of ICCAT
for the years 1994 and 1995, and plans for the implementation of a Bluefin Statistical Document to be required for the
import of bluefin tuna by ICCAT countries. The next Regular Meeting of ICCAT will be held in December 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It was noted in the FR notice that according to the Standing Committee on Research and Statistics of ICCAT (SCRS) and
NMFS scientists there is uncertainty about an appropriate boundary between the western and eastern populations
of bluefin tuna. At the request of the Department of Commerce, the National Academy of Sciences has conducted an independent
review on the ``Scientific Basis of Management of the Fisheries for Atlantic Bluefin Tuna,'' which evaluated information
on stock structure as well as recent population assessments. The report was presented to the Department of Commerce
on August 31, 1994. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has named a team of experts to evaluate
the findings and make recommendations about policy and management issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Within the comment period, the Service received a total of 83 comments on the possible CITES listing of this species
from the general public, commercial and recreational fishers and fishing organizations, conservation organizations,
and foreign governments. Of these, 73 supported a listing of the Atlantic bluefin tuna in Appendix II, 8 opposed any
listing under CITES, and 2 did not specifically oppose or support a listing. (Comments from the Russian Government
were received after the comment period closed.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Executive Secretary of ICCAT conveyed the comments of the Chairman of ICCAT. While not commenting on the appropriateness
of a CITES listing, the Chairman drew attention to steps that ICCAT had recently taken to improve the conservation
of Atlantic bluefin tuna, including: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Drastically reducing the allowable catch for western Atlantic bluefin tuna; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Introducing an effective measure for monitoring international trade through the Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document
Program; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Undertaking or developing other methods to improve data collection; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Encouraging expansion of research and analysis with a goal of having the basis to develop a program at the Commission
meeting in 1995 aimed at achieving a 50 percent increase from current levels in the spawning stock biomass of the western
stock by the year 2008; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Adopting an amendment to ICCAT that would allow the European Union to be a Contracting Party to ICCAT and hence expand
the number of countries adhering to the ICCAT recommendations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters opposed to an Appendix II listing for Atlantic bluefin tuna (including the Global Guardian Trust, the
National Fisheries Institute, Inc., and the International Coalition of Fisheries Associations) generally believed
that measures recommended by ICCAT are being implemented according to schedule, and that the steps taken by ICCAT
represent significant progress in improving reporting requirements and management measures. Therefore, they
felt that it is not necessary or appropriate to consider a CITES listing until the effectiveness of these steps can
be evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Japan Fisheries Association contended that international organizations for the management of living resources,
such as ICCAT, are designed to conserve and manage resources that are at higher stock levels than are resources that
would be listed under CITES, and that species listed under CITES are being protected from possible ``extinction.''
Therefore, they believe that listing species such as the Atlantic bluefin tuna under CITES would require a digression
from the objectives of CITES, and would also go against ``the principle of sustainable development.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federation of Japan Tuna Fisheries Cooperative Associations felt that a CITES listing of Atlantic bluefin tuna
would not ensure its conservation because CITES does not have authority to limit harvest. They suggested that no conclusions
should be drawn concerning the status of the species until a peer review of information about the existence of two stocks
of Atlantic bluefin tuna is completed. The Federation also contends that the species is not currently threatened
with extinction, nor is it likely to become so, therefore it does not meet criteria for listing under CITES. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The East Coast Tuna Association maintained that recent assessments and future projections concerning the western
stock of Atlantic bluefin tuna are ``extraordinarily controversial,'' to the extent that the NMFS has requested
the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a peer review of data and information supporting these assessments as
well as the two-stock hypothesis. They believed that a CITES listing would be redundant and would likely penalize
only those fishermen who now participate in the ICCAT program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAJ felt that it is essential that any CITES listing be based on scientific evidence that there is a threat of extinction
to a species and that trade control is necessary for the protection of the species. They contended that a species should
not be listed only for the purpose of collecting trade data, especially if an international organization is already
collecting such data. They believed that an Appendix II listing of Atlantic bluefin tuna would impose undue burdens
on the enforcement capabilities of many countries. They also state that protection of wildlife cannot be accomplished
through regulation of trade alone, but harvesting should be regulated, and that CITES is not capable of harvest regulation.
Also, they believed that the interests of range states should be considered based on consultations, and range states
have not been contacted. The First Secretary (Fisheries), Embassy of Japan, essentially supported these contentions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As an ICCAT member, the Russian Ministry of Protection of the Environment and Natural Resources felt that ICCAT's
regulation of take by annual quota and the Statistical Documentation Program provide strict controls for use of the
Atlantic bluefin tuna. They also did not think that the species is threatened with extinction and therefore was not
eligible for a CITES listing.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
TRAFFIC USA submitted a detailed analysis of international trade in all species of bluefin tuna, including species
not recommended in the proposal for listing. The data indicated that a large quantity of bluefin tuna is traded by countries
that are not parties to ICCAT, although not all the bluefin tuna analyzed by the document are caught in the Atlantic.
However, the basis for this analysis was import data from three countries that report customs data in a uniform way,
Japan, New Zealand, and the United States. Although Japan is identified in the report as importing the majority of
bluefin tuna (perhaps two-thirds), statistics for other major consuming nations, including some non-ICCAT countries,
are not available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NAS felt that adding Atlantic bluefin tuna to Appendix II would help provide information needed for population
assessment models and effective management, but would not alter or reduce current traffic in tuna. Although they
were encouraged by ICCAT's catch-quota recommendations, they were discouraged by the lack of data from non-ICCAT
countries, such as Italy and Mexico. They believe that a CITES listing would elicit data from non-ICCAT countries,
which would facilitate assessment of fishing by non-ICCAT countries, particularly in spawning areas. The Wisconsin
Audubon Council, the Audubon Council of New York State, the Napa-Solano Audubon Society, the Cape Arago Audubon Society,
the New York Sportfishing Federation, ICCAT Watch, the New York Zoological Society, Environment Liaison Centre
International, the Connecticut Coastal Fishermen's Association, the HSUS, Defenders, the CMC, and the EIA all reiterated
these sentiments. The Animal Protection Institute indicated a lack of faith in ICCAT's ability to manage the Atlantic
bluefin tuna, and felt that a CITES listing would provide a better opportunity to monitor the effects of trade, especially
because it would include all non-ICCAT countries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS does not believe that Atlantic bluefin tuna should be proposed for inclusion in Appendix II of CITES at this time,
and has concluded that ICCAT members should be given adequate time to implement appropriate fishery controls, to
implement fully the Bluefin Statistical Document Program, and to develop procedures for the use of enforcement-enhancing
trade measures with respect to ICCAT's conservation program. After that time the incremental benefits of a CITES
listing could be assessed. NMFS feels that preliminary analysis of data collected through the Bluefin Tuna Statistical
Document will allow evaluation of the effectiveness of this program in calculating and monitoring trade in Atlantic
bluefin tuna.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the possibility of ecological extinction, and/or the vulnerability to significant population losses due
to trade or overexploitation, the Atlantic bluefin tuna would qualify biologically for listing in Appendix II of
CITES. However, based on available information on management measures to conserve the species, the Service believes
that a listing should not be proposed at this time. Significant quota reductions have occurred in 1994 and additional
reductions are planned for 1995. The eastern Atlantic population of bluefin tuna appears to be more productive than
its western counterpart. Eastern Atlantic bluefin tuna mature at about age 5 while western Atlantic bluefin tuna
reach maturity at about age 8, and recruitment is relatively much higher in the eastern Atlantic. However, fishing
mortality rates on immature fish in the eastern Atlantic are exceedingly high, with 30&hyph;60 percent of the landings
in recent years comprising fish less than the minimum size of 6.4 kg. recommended by ICCAT in 1975. The most recent estimate
of a overall fishing mortality is 4&hyph;6 times the levels that would be expected to produce the maximum sustainable
yield. An assessment of the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean stocks is scheduled by the SCRS in preparation for
discussions at the 1994 Regular Meeting of ICCAT.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementation of the Statistical Document Program now required for all imports into ICCAT countries will provide
more information on Atlantic bluefin tuna harvests than would CITES certificates or export permits, although ICCAT
has not yet required the collection of such information for imports/landings in non-ICCAT countries. Harvest information
would be further enhanced if non-ICCAT countries, and the European Union, became members.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The decision of the Service to forgo proposing a CITES listing is significantly influenced by the Atlantic bluefin
tuna conservation measures adopted at the 1993 annual ICCAT meeting in Madrid. In opposing the listing of the Atlantic
bluefin tuna at the 1992 CITES meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP8) in Kyoto, Japan, representatives for
ICCAT argued that ICCAT, not CITES, was the appropriate international vehicle for implementing necessary conservation
measures for Atlantic bluefin tuna. In response to this approach, the United States delegation to the 1993 ICCAT meeting
proposed and secured significant quota reductions for the western population of Atlantic bluefin tuna.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another factor supporting the decision of the Service is the progress made by the Permanent Working Group of ICCAT
in April 1994 in fashioning a proposal (to be discussed further at the ICCAT plenary meeting in late 1994) for trade
measures to be used as an ICCAT enforcement tool.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From the point of view of NMFS, the adoption of quota reductions for 1994 and 1995 demonstrated ICCAT's resolve to maintain
the leadership role in the conservation of the bluefin tuna. However, in the event that appropriate conservation
measures are not adopted by ICCAT or prove to be inadequate, the Service will reconsider proposing this species for
listing in a CITES Appendix, through a postal procedure if listing is thought to be necessary prior to the next Conference
of the Parties.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sphyrnidae

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) sharks. Requiem and hammerhead shark species occur in pelagic and/or coastal waters worldwide, mostly in tropical
to temperate regions. Sizes range from the white, mako, and great hammerhead at over 3 m, to smaller coastal species
as the sandbar and scalloped hammerhead sharks. They are predators of various types. Fertilization and development
of young is, in most species, internal, and young are born as active, fully developed, and relatively large individuals.
The number of young in a brood is usually small (about 2 to 25), but the relative maturity at birth usually results in
high survival rates. Often gestation periods are long (up to 1 year). There are no population size estimates over large
areas for sharks.

Eight responses concerning these sharks were received within the comment period; four favored their listing in Appendix
II, and four were opposed to a listing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CMC, NAS, and HSUS, along with other commenters, stated that because large sharks are slow to reach sexual maturity
and reproduce at long intervals, they must be managed more conservatively than other commercial fisheries. They
cite the demand for shark fins as probably the largest factor in the presumed global decline of sharks, although meat
is also in demand, and a new market for shark cartilage as a cancer treatment has developed. The NAS pointed out that
most shark experts question whether sustainable exploitation of sharks is even possible and that over 90 percent
of the shark fisheries in this century have failed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TRAFFIC USA submitted an unpublished paper from the World Conservation Monitoring Centre on shark fin trade, entitled,
``International Trade in Shark Fins.'' The study was undertaken to quantify the volume and value of shark fins in international
trade, and to identify the main producer and consumer nations. However, due to the limited availability of trade data,
statistics from only nine countries were analyzed. The paper calls for closer attention to studies of trends in shark
populations, in order to protect sharks from overexploitation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In opposition to a CITES listing, the International Coalition of Fisheries Associations and the National Fisheries
Institute commented that the lack of available information on population structure, distribution, abundance,
and population trends for these species limit the presentation of scientific evidence to support a proposal for listing.
They expressed concern that an Appendix II listing might encourage unilateral actions, such as the U.S. Atlantic
coast shark fishery management plan, that could provide a basis for CITES nations to determine that their shark production
was non-detrimental, rather than participating in regional cooperative management programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Japan Fisheries Association and the FAJ indicated that available scientific information does not support listing
these shark species, and that a listing would impose an excessive burden on the management and scientific authorities
of concerned parties to CITES.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS took note of the lack of specific information in many comments received, and based on this limitation, combined
with the lack of research cross-referencing trade statistics with population trends, NMFS decided that they would
not recommend proposing any shark species for listing in the CITES Appendices. The Service agrees with this view,
and also feels that the data available on the status of shark species worldwide are not sufficient to support the listing
of all species in these two families at this time.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Rhincodon typus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The whale shark is the only species in the genus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Rhincodon,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and occurs worldwide mainly in tropical and subtropical waters (except in the Mediterranean). It is a large (8&hyph;10
m, and up to 4.5 metric tons), slow, mainly surface dwelling, plankton-feeder. Historically it appears to have been
infrequent in occurrence; no reliable population estimates seem to exist, and they are nowhere abundant. The meat
is eaten, but it is soft and apparently brings a low price in most markets. Whale sharks are taken commercially in a few
places around the world (mostly in Asia), especially during seasons when other more valuable fish species are not
available. Although fins are removed for the shark fin soup trade, some are considered second grade.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EIA proposed to the Service that the whale shark be considered for inclusion in Appendix II of CITES. The Service
received nine comments on the whale shark within the comment period; five supported a listing and four were opposed.
(Most comments were directed to all sharks, not specifically to the whale shark.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TRAFFIC USA indicated that TRAFFIC Oceania has undertaken the collection and analysis of shark species in trade globally,
and enclosed a TRAFFIC USA Newsletter on sharks as well as an unpublished report entitled, ``International Trade
in Shark Fins.'' The CMC noted that commercial shark fishing is increasing worldwide as the demand for shark meat and
fins continues to expand, and invoked the slow growth rates, late maturation, and small number of young produced as
being characteristics of sharks in general that also apply to whale sharks and increase their vulnerability. They
indicated that there are commercial fisheries for whale sharks in waters off India, Pakistan, China, Senegal, and
the Philippines that appear to be expanding, and noted that the generally coastal habitat of whale sharks and their
slow movements make them vulnerable to boat collisions and harpooning. The AHA and the NAS reiterated these comments,
adding that, as a precautionary principle, the species should be listed rather than waiting until additional data
and information is accumulated. The HSUS noted that shark populations in general are considered overexploited,
at least in parts of their range, and, although data are lacking, they believed that trade in whale shark fins is probably
increasing. They supported a listing in order that data on trade and exploitation might be collected for the species.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In opposition to the listing of the whale shark, the International Coalition of Fisheries Associations and the National
Fisheries Institute, Inc. suggested that an Appendix II listing would probably not affect the limited subsistence
fisheries in parts of Asia, but that it might limit or undermine a more coordinated international approach that could
effectively control mortality. They repeated the comments from others that there is little or no information on the
whale shark's population structure, distribution, abundance, population trends, or trade. The Japan Fisheries
Association stated that available scientific information on sharks does not warrant listing these species in any
CITES Appendix. The FAJ essentially agreed with this assessment, adding that a listing would add an excessive burden
to the Management and Scientific Authorities of the CITES Parties concerned.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS took note of the lack of specific information in many of the comments received, and, based on this limitation,
combined with the lack of research cross-referencing trade statistics with population trends, NMFS decided that
they would not recommend proposing the whale shark for listing in a CITES Appendix. NMFS will continue to monitor work
being done in this area in order to better assess possible recommendations at a later date.

At this time the Service feels that there is insufficient information on status and international trade to support
a proposal to list the whale shark in Appendix II of CITES. A better understanding of the possible threats to this species
is needed before such a proposal could be considered. There does not appear to be firm evidence suggesting that the
whale shark has ever been other than infrequent in occurrence, or that there has been a significant increase in the
catch of this species by the traditional fisheries in Asia.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

with the species individually supported the submission of a proposal: Mr. J. Beavers (Schaghticoke, New York); Sr.
L. Quevedo-H. (Santa Cruz, Bolivia); Dr. L.K. Snook (Westport, Connecticut); and Sr. A. Szwagrzak (La Paz, Bolivia).
Moreover, Dr. J.O. Browder, an Associate Professor in the Department of Urban Affairs and Planning of Virginia Polytechnic
Institute and State University, provided a copy of his recent study on the feasibility of small-holder mahogany-planting
in Rond&ocirc;nia, Brazil; and TRAFFIC USA advised the Service that it was collaborating with a graduate student
of public policy at Harvard University who was studying the relative importance of illegal trade in the total trade
in the species and the potential effectiveness of a CITES listing in achieving sustainable harvest and trade. Subsequently,
TRAFFIC USA advised the Service that instead the study had evolved into hypothetical policy ramifications, and consequently
they did not have such new data and information to provide.

The responses opposed to the submission of a proposal were from the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) and the International
Wood Products Association (IHPA). At the Service's public meeting held on February 22, 1994, the IHPA inquired concerning
the responsibilities and process used by the CITES Plants Committee (CPC) in recommending that proposals be considered,
and the intention of the Service with regard to circulating potential proposals to the range States for comments,
and whether those comments would be reflected in final positions of the United States on the species. The Service representatives
responded that the CPC had advisory and technical roles, that the Service intended to communicate with the range States,
and that the views of range States would be seriously considered. In comments submitted March 14, 1994, IHPA stated
that they share a belief that the species does not qualify for Appendix II. They provided a broad and detailed commentary
of opposition (with enclosures), which covered the three potential proposals for the several mahoganies. The Service
has noted the particular comments on the genera of African mahoganies in the section on those genera below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

At COP8, during an informal meeting on whether to include 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Swietenia macrophylla 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in Appendix II, most range States favored the Costa Rica or U.S. proposals_except Bolivia, Peru, and Honduras. Ultimately
the preferred U.S. proposal was withdrawn because of continuing disagreement. In keeping with Resolution Conf.
8.21, the Service provided a draft of the new proposal to the range States in mid-April 1994 and solicited their comments.
Prior to the June 10, 1994, deadline for submission of proposals for COP9, Brazil, Bolivia, and Peru expressed opposition
to the potential proposal, whereas Colombia and El Salvador expressed support. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has been discussing this topic with the USFS, particularly regarding concerns about ecological extinction
of the species, and with the U.S. Department of State, regarding the positions of range States and the effective role
of CITES. The Service recognizes that some have argued that the purchase of CITES-approved mahogany wood could support
sustainable use of this species, since listing requires the countries where a species is native to find that its export
would not be detrimental to the survival of the species before they issue export permits.

On June 9, 1994, the Service became aware that The Netherlands had submitted a proposal for inclusion of this species
in Appendix II. The United States decided not to submit another proposal and to address unresolved issues, in an effort
to reach a consensus on the proposal that The Netherlands had already submitted for this species. The Service is now
seeking comments on that proposal; see the September 6, 1994,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
extending to the Comoros Islands and Madagascar. All the species have been declining from habitat conversion and
selectively varied commercial exploitation, and nearly all have been reported to be threatened in various countries
and significant portions of their ranges. The majority of the 17 species have some legal protection in one or more countries,
generally with respect to their export. Within the comment period the Service received six comments, with three in
favor of submitting proposals for the species and two against. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Fauna and Flora Preservation Society (London, U.K.) supported the inclusion of all species of both genera in Appendix
II. They stated that ``Due to the nature of the mahogany trade, it is important to appreciate that equal and parallel
attention and protection must be afforded to

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 There are only a few areas of Africa where *&blank;*&blank;* African mahoganies have [not] already suffered massive
decline *&blank;*&blank;*.'' The NRDC also expressed support for including both genera in Appendix II and concern
about the inter-relationships of trade in wood of the three genera. The AIA chair of its Rainforest and Natural Resources
Task Group, who is also a member of the Steering Group of the AIA Committee on the Environment, wrote, on behalf of the
architects of the AIA, in favor of the inclusion of the genera. He stated that he understood Appendix II listing would
not constitute a trade ban, and that inclusion of the species would help architects and designers to make responsible
and objective decisions concerning their use [since they could purchase from the CITES-approved exports]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the Service's public meeting held on February 22, 1994, an individual representing IHPA inquired concerning the
responsibilities and process used by the CPC in recommending that proposals be considered, and the intention of the
Service with regard to circulating potential proposals to the range States for comments, and whether those comments
would be reflected in final positions of the United States on the species. Service representatives responded that
the CPC had advisory and technical roles, that Germany had the lead with African mahoganies and was communicating
with the range States, and that the views of range States would be seriously considered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In early May 1994, the Service received copies of the replies Germany had received by April 26, from 13 of the 31 range
States; 6 supported inclusion of the genera in Appendix II, 3 were against proposals, and 4 were neutral.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its comments submitted March 14, 1994, IHPA stated that they do not believe that these genera qualify for Appendix
II. They provided a broad and detailed commentary of opposition (with enclosures), which covered the three potential
proposals for the several mahoganies. Regarding in particular the African mahoganies, the IHPA stated that the volumes
of traded wood listed in the proposals are not clearly linked to total reductions in standing volumes of the species
across their ranges. They also stated that much is in protected areas and gave as an example that 20 percent of rainforest
in Ghana is in totally protected reserves. In addition, IHPA enclosed a letter of February 18, 1994, to them from the
Planning Branch of the Ghana Forestry Department, which stated that listing under CITES is not necessary for the protection
of these species in Ghana, and provided details on Ghana forest management and these species; see the similar statement
below, from the Ghana Timber Export Development Board.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Trade and Investment Office of the Embassy of Ghana in the United States expressed opposition to including 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Entandrophragma 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Khaya 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in Appendix II. However the basic differences in controls between Appendix II and Appendix I may not have been fully
understood by them or the Ghana Forestry Department, as the Embassy included a statement from the Ghana Timber Export
Development Board (Takoradi, Ghana), similar to the letter of the Forestry Department, both of which expressed the
view that ``A ban [sic] on exploitation of these species in the case of Ghana is rather likely to undermine current efforts
to protect them *&blank;*&blank;*'' The Embassy stated that the timber industry is a very important contributor
to foreign-exchange earnings, those two genera constitute about 50 percent of their production and exports, and
the country has made great strides (giving details) towards sustainable management of Ghana forests. They stated
that forest management in Ghana now is recognized as being the best in sub-Saharan Africa. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Embassy included a detailed statement from the Timber Export Development Board which stated that Ghana has made
forest-management reforms and has conservative forest-exploitation controls and protective strategies that
provide adequate regulatory measures to ensure sustainable utilization, which are being enforced. The Board provided
details about the four 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Khaya 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
species that are native, indicating that four of the seven species are quite widely distributed and some of the species
occur nationally at very low densities, and giving thorough estimated inventories of the seven species (for the high-forest
region of southern Ghana). The Board noted that there are few remaining large trees for exploitation, but that ``*&blank;*&blank;*
this implies commercial extinction of the species only, as there is plenty of regeneration and the present management
system has been designed to protect the species.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service was advised that Germany would submit proposals to include the two genera in Appendix II, and decided that
the United States would evaluate the German proposal objectively without being a co-proponent.

Aloe 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Aloe vera 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(synonym 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Aloe barbadensis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The genus is essentially African. Plants regarded as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Aloe vera 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
have been used by people for millennia and the yellow-flowered species may be extinct in its native range_it may have
been native to the southern Arabian Peninsula or northeastern Africa (e.g., Ethiopia) where similar species occur
(but perhaps instead was native to the Canary Islands). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The parts and derivatives of artificially propagated 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Aloe vera 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
are unregulated. The whole plants commonly in trade as aloe vera are of artificially propagated (or also naturalized)
origin, and they have become an enforcement burden. On January 27, 1994 (59 FR 3832), the Service announced that it
was considering submission of a proposal to remove the non-native population of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Aloe 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
that is geographically distinct from the general African area. All species of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Aloe 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
where they may be native thus would have continued to be regulated by CITES, including those on the Arabian Peninsula
and the islands neighboring Africa, such as the Canary Islands, Socotra, and Madagascar. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although no written comments were received during the comment period, Mr. Gary W. Lyons (of Gary Lyons Garden &amp;
Horticultural Consultant &amp; Design), a member of the IUCN/SSC Cactus and Succulent Specialist Group and past
chair of the Conservation Committee of the Cactus and Succulent Society of America, renewed (by telephone within
the comment period) the concerns in his written commentary provided to the Service for the September 1993 CPC Meeting,
and in August 1994 provided a copy of his analysis written for consideration during the 23rd Congress of the International
Organization for Succulent Plant Study. On April 12, 1994, the United States discussed the subject at the 17th CITES
North American Region Meeting near Ottawa, Canada. That group recommended that a proposal not be submitted, because
of the risk it would create for illegal import of rare 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Aloe taxa,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 possibly including native wild 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Aloe vera. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service considered whether exclusion of the plants from the non- native (non-African) population of Aloe 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
would significantly increase risk to the survival in its native range of any 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Aloe 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i.e., species, subspecies, botanical variety, or significant population). The United States decided not to submit
a proposal. The subject was discussed at the CPC meeting in May 1994; Switzerland has since submitted a proposal for
the removal of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Aloe barbadensis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
[sic] [i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Aloe vera
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
] from Appendix II. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service is now seeking comments on that proposal; see the September 6, 1994,

10. Port-Orford-cedar (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Chamaecyparis lawsoniana
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Port-Orford-cedar (POC) is endemic to southwestern Oregon as well as northwestern California, in an area that
is generally coastal, mostly from about Coos Bay to Arcata. The species has been significantly reduced in natural
standing volume, and is now logged almost entirely for export (primarily to Japan). An introduced pathogen (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Phytophthora lateralis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) has been spreading particularly as a side effect of soil transport by vehicles and logging equipment. Within the
comment period the Service received 28 comments, 17 in favor of submitting a proposal to include this species in CITES
Appendix II, and 11 against. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dr. D.B. Zobel, a plant ecologist and professor at Oregon State University, who has studied and/or observed the species
and its situation since 1972 and is senior author of the monograph Ecology, Pathology, and Management of Port-Orford-Cedar
(1985), considered that an attempt to control POC harvest through CITES would not be appropriate or effective, and
could be counterproductive. He provided a detailed review that sometimes questioned whether assertions of threat,
management, or protection were unproven belief or fact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dr. T.T. Lawson, a forest pathologist of Lawson-Rasor Associates, who has spent several years monitoring research
and control efforts on the POC disease, submitted a detailed evaluation and concluded that listing POC in Appendix
II is appropriate and needed to reduce spread of the root pathogen. Dr. E.M. Hansen, Professor of Forest Pathology
at Oregon State University, has worked with POC and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Phytophthora lateralis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
for 22 years. He submitted detailed information and data about research on the root-rot disease and assessments of
its present status and potential effects. While continuing to be seriously concerned about the impact of the disease
on POC, he opposed listing because he believed that [even] halting log exports would not slow the spread of the disease,
and might indirectly lead to a reduction in the management efforts to protect POC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Oregon Natural Resources Council provided additional information on POC and its situation, including the report
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In press
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) by T.T. Lawson, Port-Orford-Cedar: A Species Under Siege. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Siskiyou Regional Education Project and Siskiyou Audubon Society supported proposed inclusion of the species
in Appendix II, providing a detailed analytical report. They stated that POC has been found to be a keystone species
in riparian forests, enhancing their biodiversity (including fisheries), and that this species also is sometimes
a critical riparian colonizer. They questioned various relatively recent regional and local USFS administrative
plans, decisions, and activities. They detailed concerns and evidence about spread of the disease, even into areas
designated as wilderness, wild-and-scenic rivers, and botanical areas, consequent to salvage-logging and new
logging operations as well as travel on back-country roads inadequately restricted or not closed. They included
and endorsed a statement also sent separately by Mr. J. Rogers, a professional forester of Rogers &amp; Associates
who since 1968 has been familiar with the species and consequences of the root-rot disease from logging. He stated
that unless export is halted, most of what remains of the species will be logged and/or infected, including the largest
known individual of the species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRDC expressed support for inclusion of this species in Appendix II, and supplied detailed additional information
and data on its situation. They stated that this species is the only Pacific Northwest conifer that can still be exported
from Federal lands in log form legally since it had been designated a surplus commodity, and because of high foreign
demand for logs_almost exclusively from old-growth trees. They noted concerns about genetic erosion, and provided
details regarding the water mold and its potential and likelihood of spreading. The NRDC believes that a halt to logging
has become necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Greenpeace USA supported the proposal to include the species in Appendix II, stating among other concerns that continued
logging of the best POC stocks could further reduce the genetic reserves of the species and the possibility of finding
potential genotypes that could resist or overcome the disease. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Fauna and Flora Preservation Society (London, U.K.) indicated that the export appeared to clearly warrant inclusion
of the species in Appendix II. The chair of the AIA Rainforest and Natural Resources Task Group, who is also a member
of the Steering Group of the AIA Committee on the Environment, wrote on behalf of the architects of the AIA, in favor
of inclusion of this species. He stated that he understood CITES Appendix II listing would not constitute a trade ban,
and that inclusion of the species could help architects and designers to make more responsible and objective decisions
concerning its use [since they could purchase from the CITES-approved supplies]. During the comment period eight
letters from the general public supported submission of a proposal to include POC in Appendix II.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Oregon Department of Forestry expressed opposition to inclusion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this species in Appendix II. They stated that virtually all of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercially valuable timber of the species is on Federal lands, that there is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ample protection due to the extensive acreage of land set aside for various 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conservation purposes, and that there is a program in place that will limit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
damage caused by the root disease on Federal lands and it is adequate to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protect the species. They also found that the ecosystem-based direction of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management taken by Federal land-management agencies under the President's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Option 9'' plan is sufficient to protect this species in its ecosystems, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they expect that the volume of the type of material demanded in the export 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
market will be reduced because of implementation of this plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection stated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they advise private landowners on precautions to be taken to prevent spread of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the root rot, and that they generally have as a mitigation requirement of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
timber harvesting that the landowner follow the USFS policies and procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
They asked that the decision for or against a proposal to list under CITES be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made to protect or prolong the biological and ecological viability of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species in its natural range. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The USFS recommended that the species not be added to Appendix II. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USFS provided detailed information (with detailed maps) about the species, its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
utilization, the water mold that infects POC and causes a virulent root 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disease, and the interagency program for Port-Orford-cedar conservation and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management [through the Interregional POC Coordinating Committee], which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USFS chairs. The USFS stated that over 40 percent of the tree species' range 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is in reserves protected from harvesting, that harvests have substantially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
declined and growth now exceeds harvest and mortality, and that they have an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
active range-wide interagency effort underway [and the Interregional Port-Orford Cedar Action Plan] to manage
the species and the infectious fungus. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service carefully evaluated whether

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
qualified for CITES Appendix II, and could benefit from export regulation by means of an Appendix II listing, which
included a discussion of its situation at the CITES Plants Committee meeting held in Mexico in May 1994. The Service
recognized that a significant portion of POC is in reserves that for various reasons are protected from harvesting
(in some cases except for thinning and salvage cutting), that most of the species is on public lands under Federal management,
and that there are meaningful efforts to harvest sustainably and to curtail the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
disease. The Service concluded that Federal and State regulatory mechanisms, governmental and private conservation
actions, and endeavors particularly through the U.S. Forest Service to understand and to control the introduced
disease now affecting some populations, were able to cope with this endemic species' present circumstances without
the need for additional regulatory authority through use of this international treaty.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Saiga tatarica
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The EIA sent the Service a proposal to list both subspecies of the saiga antelope in Appendix I. The horns of the saiga
antelope have been used in Asian traditional medicines. Saiga have also been utilized as a food source at varying levels
of intensity depending on location and availability. The Mongolian Ministry of Nature and Environment provided
a rather detailed account of the status and biology of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
S. t. mongolica, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
which now exists in two small disjunct populations in Mongolia, one estimated at about 1400 individuals in 1993 and
the other estimated at 125 animals in 1983. They recommended that this subspecies be listed in Appendix I.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Saiga tatarica tatarica occurs in two major populations, one in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Kazakhstan and a second south of the Volga River and northwest of the Caspian 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sea in the Kalmykian Republic, Russian Federation. By the end of World War I 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this subspecies was near extinction, but began to recover in the 1920's so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that by the late 1950's the population in Kazakhstan was reported to have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reached nearly 2,000,000, and in Kalmykia saiga had reportedly increased to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about 800,000. In the last two decades these numbers have been reduced again, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fluctuating around 150,000 in Kalmykia and down to about 450,000 in Kazakhstan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the last few years. These reductions are reportedly the result of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combination of factors including weather, land-use changes, and poaching for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
horns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four comments were received within the comment period. Three comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
favored listing saiga antelope in Appendix I, while the fourth supported only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an Appendix II listing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AHA was in favor of an Appendix I listing ``until trade in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species can be shown to be non-detrimental to the survival of the species.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
They stated that researchers indicate that saiga hunting in Russia has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nearly out of control over the last 3&hyph;4 years, implying that this increase is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
due to poaching for horns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Defenders supported an Appendix I listing, suggesting that saiga, like 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the rhino, are being threatened by poaching and overhunting for the horn 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trade, and that saiga horn is the most expensive fever-reducing substance used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in traditional medicines after rhino horn. They stated that saiga are also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hunted for their meat, fat, and hides. They admitted that status and trade 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data are extremely limited, but that recent aerial surveys indicated a rapid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate of decline of saiga populations. They also pointed out the dramatic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population reductions that can occur among saiga due to extreme weather 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions or food shortages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The HSUS favored an Appendix I listing for the saiga, also indicating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the similarity between the use and demand for rhino and saiga horn. From an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimated 2 million animals in the 1960's, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
S. t. tatarica 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
has plummeted to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about 800,000 individuals according to HSUS, due apparently to uncontrolled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hunting in Russia and Kazakhstan for the horns. The HSUS noted that the use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of saiga horn as a substitute for rhino horn in traditional Chinese medicine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has been and is likely to increase as pressures to control the trade in rhino 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
horn intensify. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The World Conservation Union's (IUCN) Sustainable Use of Wildlife 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Programme questioned the long-term benefits to saiga to be derived from an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix I listing. Such a listing for the Russian subspecies would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technically prohibit commercial trade in the species, thus eliminating its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value. Local and regional authorities currently would find it nearly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impossible to implement the controls necessary to sustain saiga populations in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the absence of obvious and immediate value to the local economy. They 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested that the local rural population would probably increase livestock 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numbers in saiga habitat to supplement and replace the value lost from saiga 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a result of an Appendix I listing, eventually resulting in extirpation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the saiga. An Appendix II listing would require the Governments of Russia 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(for the Kalmykia population), Kazakhstan, and Mongolia to implement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative and management procedures that, if adequate, could be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beneficial to the species. The IUCN group was concerned about the demand for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
saiga horn and possible illegal trade. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments received from the Russian Ministry of Protection of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environment and Natural Resources described the existence of the two major 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
populations of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
S. t. tatarica, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
one in Kalmykia of about 150,000 animals and one in Kazakhstan consisting of ``several tens of thousands.'' Hunting
of saiga has been increasingly reduced since about 1984, with only limited sport-hunting now allowed in Kalmykia,
and protected reserves have been established. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The diminished status of the saiga is due to habitat modifications, changes in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
land use, and illegal hunting. The Ministry favored a listing of saiga 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antelope in Appendix II of CITES. Also, by personal communication, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chinese Ministry of Forestry indicated that they could support an Appendix II 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listing.

In addition, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service funded a visit in the Spring of 1994 to Moscow and Kalmykia by Dr. James
Teer, Welder Wildlife Foundation, Sinton, Texas, and Dr. Fred Lindzey, Wyoming Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research
Unit, University of Wyoming, Laramie, Wyoming, to report on the status of the saiga. Teer and Lindzey opined that the
Kalmykian saiga population can no longer sustain itself when harvests for horns, meat, and hides are permitted for
export, but that it can sustain a small offtake from hunting. Even so, they were concerned about poaching and the ease
of movement of saiga parts across borders. They also felt that the Kalmykian population might rebound due to the great
fecundity of saiga, along with a reduction in livestock, habitat improvement, and the control of poaching, all factors
the Kalmykian authorities claim they are implementing. While realizing that an Appendix II listing would not prohibit
exports, Teer and Lindzey suggested that the United States might delay proposing a CITES listing to allow time for
current management measures and the population status in Kalmykia to be evaluated, and to give Kazakhstan time to
become a Party to CITES. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 As a result of comments and information received concerning the amount of poaching of saiga antelope and the illegal
trade in saiga horns, the use of saiga horns in combination with or as a substitute for rhinoceros horns in traditional
medicines in conjunction with intensified pressures to stop the trade in rhinoceros horn, and the evidence of considerable
declines in populations of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
S. t. tatarica 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
over the last two decades for various reasons, the Service has proposed that populations of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
S. t. tatarica
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 be included in Appendix II of CITES. The numbers of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
S. t. mongolica
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 are so low in the wild that the full protective potential of CITES seems warranted, therefore the Service has proposed
that the Mongolian population be included in Appendix I of CITES. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Urial (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ovis vignei
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The Service requested information and comments to help clarify which populations of the urial should be included
in Appendix I as a result of the 1973 listing of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ovis vignei 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
by India. Confusion regarding the intended inclusiveness of the original listing of 1973 arose as a result of (1) actions
considered at COP2 in 1979; (2) range information presented in the CITES-adopted check list for mammals, Mammal Species
of the World, 1982, edited by Honacki, Kinman, and Koeppl; and, (3) distribution and synonymy given in Mammal Species
of the World, 2nd Edition, 1993, edited by Wilson and Reeder. The issue was whether the original listing implies a conservative
application of the name, thereby restricting the listing to only populations in the Ladakh region of Jammu and Kashmir,
or there was a broader intent, as presented in Honacki, Kinman, and Koeppl, 1982? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Five comments were received within the comment period on this problem. TRAFFIC USA passed on information from TRAFFIC
India attesting to the endangered status of the urial sheep in India, and from TRAFFIC France indicating that urial
hunting trips in central Asia are being organized by French companies. Dr. Steve Edwards, IUCN, supported the submission
of a proposal to clarify which populations of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
O. vignei 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
are to be included in Appendix I. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The three remaining comments were from Safari Club International, Dr. Richard Mitchell, and Mr. Ron Young of Expeditions
by Ron. The first two commenters argued that the intent of the original listing was to include only the population in
the Ladakh region of Jammu and Kashmir, while the latter noted that, according to his observation, the Transcaspian
urial, the Afghan urial, the Blandford urial, and the Punjab urial are all abundant in the wild. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Government of Pakistan indicated that the shapu (

)), the gad (

O. o. blanfordi
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
= O. v. blanfordi
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
)), and the Punjab urial (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
O. o. punjabiensis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
= O. v. punjabiensis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
)) are in fair numbers in Pakistan and that there is no need to list them under CITES. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, Mr. Earl Baysinger, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, who attended the Convention's Plenipotentiary Meeting
and COP2, provided a detailed account of the discussions that took place at that meeting of the Parties concerning
the proposal and ultimate listing of the urial, and claimed that the Parties intended to include only 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
O. vignei vignei
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in Appendix I. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service is, therefore, proposing that only 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
O. vignei vignei
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the Ladakh region of Jammu and Kashmir be retained in Appendix I, and that all other populations of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
O. vignei
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 be included in Appendix II for biological and similarity of appearance purposes.

3. Box turtles (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Terrapene 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
spp.). Prior to COP8, the New York Zoological Society recommended listing box turtles in Appendix II. However, the
Service did not have sufficient information on trade in these species, and did not submit a proposal for consideration
at COP8. Since then the Service has accumulated data in its Law Enforcement Management Information System (LEMIS)
on exports and imports of box turtles in an effort to obtain appropriate trade information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The genus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Terrapene
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 includes the four species (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
T. carolina, T. coahuila, T. nelsoni, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
T. ornata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), with 11 subspecies recognized among them. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Terrapene coahuila 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
is currently listed in Appendix I of CITES. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Terrapene nelsoni
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 occurs in a small fragmented range on the west coast of Mexico, while

T. ornata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is found over a large area of the midwestern United States. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Terrapene carolina 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
has the largest range, occurring from Canada to Mexico as far as Yucatan, and from the Atlantic coast west into approximately
the eastern edge of the prairie in the Midwest.

Box turtles are long-lived, sexual maturity is late, and annual reproduction is low. They exhibit high site fidelity,
which tends to amplify the impacts of habitat fragmentation. The removal of adult turtles from the wild can have a significant
impact on the status of populations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A large number of comments were received in response to the January 27, 1994, notice. Twenty-two States responded,
in 16 of which box turtles are protected by State law. None of these responses objected to a proposal to list the box turtle
in Appendix II. Comments from the States noted the continued loss of habitat, illegal collecting, negative impacts
of the pet trade in box turtles, some indications of international trade, and suggestions of declines in some populations.
Of the 298 comments received from individuals, only one did not support the proposal to list box turtles under CITES,
and this one negative comment was made pending the collection of more data. Many of these comments included anecdotal
accounts and observations of population declines, and the occurrence of box turtles for sale in pet stores in the United
States and abroad. Supporting comments were also received on behalf of 23 non-governmental organizations, although
2 of these supported the listing of box turtles conditioned on proper treatment of pet-trade turtles, and more rapid
processing of permit applications. Most of these responses focused on the impacts of the pet trade and poor shipping
conditions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on (1) the large number of box turtles exported from the United States since 1988; (2) an apparent increase in
the demand for box turtles in the international pet trade, particularly since 1984 when the EU banned trade in Mediterranean
land tortoises (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Testudo
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 spp.); (3) the reported decline in numbers throughout the range of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
T. ornata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
T. carolina
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
; (4) an increase in fragmentation of box turtle habitat; (5) the difficulties of implementing State protective laws,
especially when similar protection is not provided in other States; and (6) the increased negative impact of these
factors on species exhibiting low reproductive rates and high site fidelity; the Service has proposed to include
all the populations of box turtles in the genus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Terrapene
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in Appendix II of CITES, except 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
T. coahuila,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 which will remain in Appendix I.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Brachypelma
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 species). The Service received a proposal from Dr. Robert Wolff of Trinity Christian College, Palos Heights, Illinois
to list all the species in the genus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Brachypelma
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (also known as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Euathlus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) in Appendix II. There are about nine species in the genus, and one, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
B. smithi
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the red-kneed tarantula, is presently included in Appendix II. Members of this genus are usually colorful and among
the most sought after tarantulas for the pet trade. The taxonomy of the genus is not well known and identification of
species is often difficult. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four responses to the possible listing of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Brachypelma 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
species were received. Although one commenter only supported the inclusion of the genus in Appendix II by implication,
the other three commenters specifically supported this action. The HSUS noted the popularity of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Brachypelma
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 species in the pet trade and the enhanced support of enforcement efforts that this action would provide. TRAFFIC USA
claimed that there is increasing evidence for widespread trade in several species of the genus. TRAFFIC France reported
to TRAFFIC USA increased trade in tarantula species throughout western Europe involving at least four other species
in addition to

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
B. smithi.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Mexican Government supported the addition of all species of

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Brachypelma
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in Appendix II. The Service has therefore proposed the inclusion of all taxa in the genus

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Brachypelma
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in Appendix II, including but not limited to the following species:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many species in the family have become extinct or reduced to very low numbers largely as a result of habitat destruction
and/or degradation. A few species have been collected commercially, initially as a source of raw material for the
button industry, but, since the advent of synthetic button materials and the artificial pearl industry in Japan,
as a source of spherical blanks around which nacre is deposited by living bivalves during the production of pearls.
These species, which are sought commercially, are generally characterized by their thick, white shells, and they
occur most often in large rivers and reservoirs. Most states where they are harvested regulate their collection,
usually with prohibitions on collection in waters known to contain populations of endangered or threatened unionid
species. Although endangered and threatened unionids may occasionally be taken incidentally along with the commercial
forms, there does not appear to be compelling evidence indicating any significant export of endangered mussels with
commercial shipments for the pearl industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other species are harvested, although in smaller numbers, for the natural freshwater pearls used in jewelry. Still
others, those with colorful nacre, are utilized directly in the production of jewelry. Shell collecting alone is
believed to be a threat to some species, especially those that are rare or unique. Trade in these products and/or shells
may constitute a threat to many species, especially those most endangered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three comments were received during the comment period concerning a possible proposal to list unionids in the Appendices
of CITES; one from the Fisheries Agency of Japan, one from the State of Missouri, and one from the Tennessee Shell Company,
Inc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAJ voiced a general concern about listing species in the absence of sufficient scientific evidence to show that
there is a threat to extinction for an Appendix I listing, or that they may become threatened with extinction unless
such species are subject to strict regulation for an Appendix II listing. Specifically, they felt that no scientific
data have been presented demonstrating the degree of extinction and the presence of threats from trading for each
of the more than 200 species of freshwater mussels. Furthermore, they stated that listing all the species of this taxon
because some are potentially threatened by collectors could also be similarly applied to all other groups of species,
which would pose a serious obstacle to the effective use of living resources. They indicated that it would be inappropriate
to enforce such regulations without justifiable reasons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Tennessee Shell Company, Inc. expressed concern for the plight of freshwater mussels in general, citing such
threats as water pollution, cold or hot water discharges into mussel habitat, sediment deposition, dredging, bridge
construction, natural die-offs, etc. They offered support of efforts directed at the protection and conservation
of freshwater mussels from habitat destruction resulting from these kinds of hazards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Missouri Department of Conservation generally supported the listing of Unionid mussels in CITES Appendices,
with the exception of four species that are of commercial value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering comments received, and the level of trade information available, along with the difficulties
of species identification and the separation of look-alikes, the Service has proposed that the Appendices to CITES
be revised by:

In response to the November 18, 1993, and the January 28, 1994, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
notices (58 FR 60973 and 56 FR 4096) comments were received from numerous organizations regarding a resolution to
amend the criteria for listing species in the CITES Appendices (see discussion of listing criteria resolution below).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, several non-governmental organizations, in writing and at the public meeting on February 22, 1994,
requested that the Service submit a resolution for consideration at COP9 establishing a Law Enforcement Network.
The Service supported the establishment of a Law Enforcement Network, both at the Standing Committee meeting of March,
1994, and in writing to the CITES Secretariat. The Service remains strongly supportive of increasing the role of law
enforcement in the CITES context, both through networks among the Parties and through increased training of appropriate
enforcement officials. It is the Service's understanding that the item is already on the agenda for COP9, and that
one or more Parties may have already submitted resolutions on the subject. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments on the possible resolutions that the Service may consider submitting were also received from the Center
for International Environmental Law (CIEL), the Hawthorn Corporation, and one private individual. The CIEL requested
that the United States submit a resolution that clarifies the relationship between CITES and other international
agreements related to the management of species. The CIEL's suggestions can be considered to be incorporated into
the resolution discussed below, regarding the implementation of Article XIV of the Convention, which deals with
the relationship between CITES and treaties regulating the management of marine species. The Hawthorn Corporation
provided comments on the issue of trade in tiger parts and products, and requested that trade in captive-bred tigers
for circuses and other live animal exhibitions be differentiated from concerns about trade in tiger parts and products
and related poaching of wild tigers. The Service agrees that tigers that are part of a U.S. traveling circus are not
part of the trade problem related to the poaching of wild specimens. Circus tigers, born in the United States, are certified
as captive-bred under CITES by the Service and are eligible for a certificate from the Service's Office of Management
Authority. The private individual provided comments on various issues related to trade in artificially propagated
plants, which the Service will take into consideration when reviewing resolutions pertaining to that trade, upon
their receipt from the CITES Secretariat. In addition, the Service's Office of Scientific Authority has been working
with the CITES Nomenclature Committee to consolidate and update the previous resolutions dealing with nomenclatural
issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following presents the background and sense of the three resolutions submitted by the United States for consideration
at COP9. (The Service's tentative positions on resolutions and agenda items, including those discussed in this notice
as well as on the establishment of a Law Enforcement Network, were presented in a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice of October 4, 1994 (59 FR 50609)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Resolutions Submitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Article XIV Implementation. The provisions of CITES apply to all species of wild fauna and flora, including marine
species. The management of many marine species comes under the jurisdiction or competence of another international
treaty, convention, or agreement. International trade in any species of marine fauna or flora is also within the purview
and competence of CITES. Therefore, even if a marine species is subject to management under another international
treaty, convention, or agreement, and if it is listed in any CITES Appendix, then international trade and introduction
from the sea in the species is also regulated by CITES. CITES made special provisions for Appendix II marine species
that are regulated under another treaty extant when CITES came into force. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Article XIV, paragraph 4, of the Convention provides that a State party to CITES, which is also a party to any other treaty,
convention, or international agreement which was in force at the time of the coming into force of CITES, and under the
provisions of which protection is afforded to marine species included in Appendix II, is relieved of the obligations
imposed on it under CITES with respect to trade in specimens included in Appendix II that are taken by ships registered
in that State and in accordance with the provisions of such other treaty, convention, or international agreement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, Article XIV, paragraph 5 requires that Parties exempted from the usual CITES obligations under Article
XIV, paragraph 4, must nevertheless issue certificates stipulating that the specimen was taken in accordance with
the provisions of the other treaty, convention, or international agreement in question. This provision of the Convention
has never been used, and standards for its implementation have not been developed. Currently no marine species whose
management is under the competence of another treaty, convention, or agreement is listed in Appendix II (this relief
from CITES obligations does not apply to specimens of species included in Appendix I). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has determined that it would be wise to plan for the need to implement Article XIV, by specifying requirements
for certificates issued pursuant to Article XIV, paragraph 5, of the Convention, even if its use is not necessary at
this time. The Service notes that Appendix II allows for international commercial trade. The draft resolution was
written in consultation with NMFS. The Service's goal in submitting this resolution is to clarify how an Appendix
II listing could be implemented expeditiously for a marine species whose management was under the competency of a
pre-CITES treaty. The draft resolution would provide for the utilization, as a valid certificate under Article XIV,
paragraph 5, of a certificate of origin or statistical document issued on the authority of the other treaty, convention,
or international agreement, with certain stipulations of minimum information and validation as required by CITES.
Such certificates would only be an option for CITES Parties that are also parties to the other treaty, convention,
or agreement, and if the specimens are taken by ships registered by the Party country. Export permits or introduction
from the sea certificates are required in all other situations.

2. Criteria for Amendments of Appendix I and II. The existing CITES listing criteria, known as the ``Berne Criteria,''
were developed at the first CITES Conference in 1976 in Berne, Switzerland. The move to revise them originated at COP8
in Japan. At COP8 the Parties agreed to start a process, coordinated by the Standing Committee, to develop a scientifically
sound revision for consideration at COP9. The World Conservation Union (IUCN) was asked to do a first draft, which
would be revised at a joint meeting of the CITES Standing, Animals, and Plants Committees, and put into CITES resolution
form. The United States participated in the joint meeting in Brussels in September 1993, which reviewed the IUCN draft
and produced a draft resolution that was circulated to the Parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to the September 1993 joint committee meeting, the Service received comments from 46 organizations and private
individuals regarding the proposed revised listing criteria. After the September 1993 Standing Committee meeting,
in response to the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice of November 18, 1993, the Service received comments from 18 organizations. The Service carefully reviewed
and analyzed all comments received. Five organizations basically supported the new criteria. The Service received
comments from 13 organizations that either opposed the new criteria, opposed parts of the new criteria, or recommended
that the United States submit an alternative to the joint committee draft resolution. All comments were taken into
consideration by the Service in formulating comments to the draft resolution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service submitted comments for the United States to the Standing Committee, after consultation with other Federal
agencies and after reviewing the extensive public comments received. Comments received by the CITES Secretariat
from other governments were also reviewed. The U.S. comments maintained that much of the draft resolution was not
valid scientifically, and was not acceptable from conservation, management or practical perspectives. The United
States believed that the criteria as proposed met neither the CITES treaty's requirements for the conservation of
species in their ecosystems, nor the diverse needs of the CITES Parties. The U.S. comments and those of other Parties
were discussed at the 31st meeting of the Standing Committee, in Geneva in March 1994. Some of the U.S. comments were
taken into consideration in developing the final Standing Committee draft resolution. The final Standing Committee
resolution was not available to the United States or other CITES Parties until after the June 10, 1994, deadline for
submission of resolutions and proposals to the CITES Secretariat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Standing Committee resolution contains six annexes, several of which the United States looks forward to discussing
further with the CITES Parties at COP9. In particular, the United States believes the Standing Committee draft is
an improvement on the Berne Criteria as regards precautionary measures. However, the United States believes that
Annex 1 (Biological criteria for Appendix I) and Annex 2 (Criteria for inclusion of species in Appendix II) are in need
of revision, particularly from a scientific perspective. The United States is particularly concerned about the
utility and scientific validity of arbitrary numerical cutoffs for decision-making regarding the appendix within
which a species should be included. After detailed review of the scientific literature and consultations with NMFS
and other Federal agencies, the Service has submitted alternatives to these Annexes to the Secretariat, along with
some additional material for inclusion in the resolution. With regard to the five comments referred to previously
as supporting the joint committee's draft resolution, there was nothing in these comments that was inconsistent
with the revised Annexes 1 and 2 submitted by the Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The United States could have waited to present these alternative Annexes 1 and 2 at COP9. However, the United States
preferred to provide ample time for this review by the CITES Parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Annex 1 lists a series of interdependent factors to be included in an assessment of the status of a species,
and thereby the determination that it is threatened with extinction. The criteria for inclusion of species in Annex
2 (in accordance with Article II paragraph 2(a)), involve a determination of whether a species may become threatened
with extinction, and in order to avoid utilization incompatible with its survival. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Standard nomenclature. This resolution was submitted at the request of the CITES Nomenclature Committee, and
deals with nomenclature and taxonomy of CITES species. The resolution submitted was discussed and agreed upon by
the Nomenclature Committee at its May 1994 meeting in Beijing, China. The Service is aware that the names of genera
and species in several families are in need of standardization, and that the current lack of standard references with
adequate information decreases the effectiveness of the implementation of CITES in conserving the many species
that are listed in the Appendices. The Service also recognizes that the taxonomy used in the appendices to the Convention
will be most useful to the Parties if standardized by nomenclatural references. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This resolution consolidates recommendations from several previous resolutions and clarifies or updates previous
recommendations. The resolution discusses inclusion of subspecies in the Appendices, use of references in proposals,
synonyms, other naming conventions, and the role of the Scientific Authorities in nomenclatural issues. The resolution
also recommends several standard references for species listed in the CITES Appendices, i.e., for mammals, birds,
amphibians, cacti, cycads, ferns, and other plants.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service submitted the following two items for inclusion in the COP9 agenda, but did not submit a resolution or discussion

prior to the COP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Items Submitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Shark trade. There is information about a recent increase in international trade in shark parts and products, particularly
in fins for the food market. However, there are insufficient biological and trade data on which to base a listing proposal
at this time. Data on these species are difficult to obtain and will require the cooperation of all Parties and organizations
interested in conserving these species. The Service believes that this is an important issue for the Parties to discuss.
The Service is considering requesting that the Animals Committee assess methods for obtaining information on the
biological and trade status of shark species in international trade, and providing advice to the Parties on possible
approaches toward conservation efforts for these taxa. No international body is currently responsible for the management
of shark species, including recommendations of catch quotas, minimum sizes, time and area closures, gear restriction,
etc. By placing this item on the agenda for COP9, it is not the intent of the United States to propose that CITES take on
this responsibility. However, because CITES is the international treaty responsible for trade in wildlife, it provides
an ideal forum for the discussion of collection of data on this trade. The Service, in consultation with NMFS, will
develop a background paper on this agenda item for submission before COP9.

2. Illegal trade in whale meat. There was extensive discussion at the May, 1994 meeting of the IWC regarding illegal
international trade in whale meat, including involvement by CITES Parties. All whales subject to the IWC moratorium
on commercial harvest are listed in CITES Appendix I. A resolution on this topic was introduced by the United States
and other Parties, and was adopted by IWC at its 1994 meeting. The issue is discussed in the IWC Infractions Report.
The Service submitted the information in the IWC Infractions Report on international trade in whale meat to the CITES
Secretariat. The Service in consultation with NMFS, will develop a background paper on this agenda item for submission
to the Parties before COP9.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In mid July, the Service received proposals made by other CITES Parties to amend the appendices. Resolutions and a
list of other agenda items that were submitted by other Parties are expected to be received at intervals in September
and October. The Service's tentative negotiating position on the species proposals was announced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on September 6, 1994, (59 FR 46023) and a comment period initiated. The Service also held two public meetings on September
14 and 16, 1994, as announced in September 1 and 7, 1994 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 45307 and 59 FR 46023). These meetings provided an opportunity for the public to comment on the species proposals
submitted by other countries and on any resolution or agenda item. In the October 4, 1994, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 50609), the Service presented information and tentative negotiating positions on resolutions and agenda
items, especially those for which official documents have been received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service will consider all information presented at the public meetings and in writing during the comment period,
as well as all other available information, in developing a negotiating position on each species proposal, resolution,
and agenda item. These positions will be announced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(s) in late October or early November just prior to COP9. Also in this pre-COP notice the Service plans to request comments
on any reservations that should be taken on any species amendments, i.e., species changes to the CITES Appendices,
should any of the proposed amendments be adopted by the Parties. Immediately after COP9, the Service will announce
the species amendments to the appendices adopted by the Parties; under CITES, these changes will become effective
on February 16, 1995.

Reservations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Article XV of CITES enables any party to exempt itself from implementing CITES for any particular species if it enters
a reservation with respect to that species in accordance with the terms and limitations of the treaty. In the case of
a country that is a Party at the time an amendment is adopted, a reservation may be entered only during the period of 90
days following the meeting at which the Parties voted to place the species in Appendix I or II. Just before COP9, the
Service will solicit comments with regard to entering reservations. If the United States enters any reservation,
such action would be announced in the same
