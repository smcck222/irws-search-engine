SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (Board) is amending its regulations that describe the periods within
which employees may make certain elections in regard to contributions to the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP). This amendment
will establish a permanent schedule of TSP open seasons, thereby eliminating the regulatory requirement that the
Board publish an advance notice in the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 16, 1994 (59 FR 41990). No comments were received. After further review the Board has decided that no changes
in the proposed rule are necessary. Accordingly, the proposed rule is published as a final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each year, there are two open seasons during which participants may elect to commence contributions to the TSP, change
the amount of their contributions or the allocation of their contributions among the TSP investment funds, or terminate
contributions without forfeiting the ability to resume contributing during the next open season. The regulatory
notice requirement for open seasons was established by the Board in 1987 shortly after the Thrift Savings Plan came
into existence. At that time, it was not clear whether open seasons would occur at the same time and for the same duration
each year. However, since then there have been two open seasons each year: May 15&hyph;July 31 and November 15&hyph;January
31. The last month of each open season has been designated the ``election period'', which is defined in 5 CFR &sect;1600.1.
Since the open seasons have not varied since 1988, the Board is now amending its regulations to establish a permanent
schedule for the beginning and ending dates and to eliminate the requirement that an advance notice of each open season
be published in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Marketing Order No. 905, as amended, [7 CFR Part 905] regulating
the handling of oranges, grapefruit, tangerines, and tangelos grown in Florida, hereinafter referred to as the order.
The order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674],
hereinafter referred to as the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing order provisions
now in effect, oranges, grapefruit, tangerines, and tangelos grown in Florida are subject to assessments. It is intended
that the assessment rate as issued herein will be applicable to all assessable citrus fruit during the 1994&hyph;95
fiscal year, beginning August 1, 1994, through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
July 31, 1995. This rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an
irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a
hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district
court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of
business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is
filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are approximately 100 citrus handlers subject to regulation under the marketing order covering fresh oranges,
grapefruit, tangerines, and tangelos grown in Florida, and approximately 10,200 producers of these fruits in Florida.
Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having
annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts
are less than $5,000,000. A minority of these handlers and a majority of these producers may be classified as small
entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This marketing order, administered by the Department, requires that the assessment rate for a particular fiscal
period shall apply to all assessable citrus fruit handled from the beginning of such period. An annual budget of expenses
and assessment rate is prepared by the Committee and submitted to the Department for approval. The Committee members
are handlers and producers of Florida citrus. They are familiar with the Committee's needs and with the costs for goods,
services, and personnel in their local area and are thus in a position to formulate appropriate budgets. The budget
is formulated and discussed in public meetings. Thus, all directly affected persons have an opportunity to participate
and provide input. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The assessment rate recommended by the Committee is derived by dividing anticipated expenses by the expected cartons
(4/5 bushel) of fruit shipped. Because that rate is applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate which
will produce sufficient income to pay the Committee's expected expenses. The annual budget and assessment rate are
usually recommended by the Committee shortly before a season starts, and expenses are incurred on a continuous basis.
Therefore, budget and assessment rate approvals must be expedited so that the Committee will have funds to pay its
expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee met June 21, 1994, and unanimously recommended expenses of $210,000 for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year,
with an assessment rate of $0.003 per 4/5 bushel carton of fresh fruit shipped. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In comparison, 1993&hyph;94 budget expenses were $200,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with an approved assessment of $0.00285. This represents increases of $10,000 in expenses and of $0.00015 in the assessment
rate from the amounts recommended for the current fiscal year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The assessment rate, when applied to anticipated shipments of 66,000,000 cartons of assessable fruit, will yield
a total of $198,000 in assessment income. Interest income for 1994&hyph;95 is estimated at $2,000. This, along with
$10,000 from the Committee's authorized reserve fund, will be adequate to cover additional expenses. Funds in the
reserve at the end of the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year, estimated at $125,000, will be within the maximum permitted by
the order of approximately one-half of one fiscal year's expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Major expense categories for the current fiscal year include $98,300 for salaries, $36,000 for the Manifest department,
and $12,600 for insurance and bonds.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 [59 FR 41378, August 12, 1994]. A 30-day comment period was provided for interested persons. No comments were received.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs would be significantly
offset by the benefits derived from the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS
has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It found that the specified expenses for the marketing order covered in this rule are reasonable and likely to be incurred
and that such expenses will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is further found that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 [5 U.S.C. 553] because the Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous
basis. The 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year for the program began April 1, 1994. The marketing orders require that the rates
of assessment apply to all assessable oranges, grapefruit, tangerines, and tangelos handled during the fiscal year.
In addition, handlers are aware of this action which was recommended by the Committee at a public meeting and published
in the

 This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 927 [7 CFR Part 927] regulating the handling of winter
pears grown in Oregon, Washington, and California. The agreement and order are effective under the Agricultural

This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing order provisions
now in effect, winter pears grown in Oregon, Washington, and California are subject to assessments. It is intended
that the assessment rate specified herein will be applicable to all assessable pears handled during the 1994&hyph;95

June 30, 1995. This final rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present
an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are approximately 90 handlers of winter pears regulated under the marketing order each season and approximately
1,850 winter pear producers in Oregon, Washington, and California. Small agricultural producers have been defined
by the Small Business Administration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[13 CFR &sect;121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms
are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of these handlers and producers
may be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Oregon, Washington, and California winter pear marketing order, administered by the Department, requires that
the assessment rate for a particular fiscal year apply to all assessable winter pears handled from the beginning of
such year. Annual budgets of expenses are prepared by the Committee, the agency responsible for local administration
of this marketing order, and submitted to the Department for approval. The members of the Committee are handlers and
producers of Oregon, Washington, and California winter pears. They are familiar with the Committee's needs and with
the costs for goods, services, and personnel in their local area, and are thus in a position to formulate appropriate
budgets. The Committee's budget is formulated and discussed in public meetings. Thus, all directly affected persons
have an opportunity to participate and provide input. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The assessment rate recommended by the Committee is derived by dividing the anticipated expenses by expected shipments
of pears. Because this rate is applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate which will provide sufficient
income to pay the Committee's expected expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee met on June 3, 1994, and unanimously recommended total expenses of $6,835,926 for the 1994&hyph;95
fiscal year. In comparison, the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal year expense amount was $6,933,615, which is $97,689 more than
the amount recommended for the current fiscal year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.43 per standard box, or equivalent for winter
pears. The Committee did not recommend a supplemental assessment rate for Anjou variety pears this fiscal year. In
comparison, the 1993&hyph;94 winter pear assessment rate was $0.45 per standard box, or equivalent and $0.04 for
the supplemental assessment rate on Anjou variety pears. This represents a $0.02 decrease in the assessment rate
recommended for this fiscal year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rate, when applied to anticipated winter pear shipments of 13,817,000 boxes or equivalent, will yield a total
of $5,941,310 in assessment income. Assessment income, along with $401,324 from other income sources, and $493,292
from the Committee's authorized reserve, will be adequate to cover budgeted expenses. The $493,292 withdrawal of
funds from the Committee's authorized reserve will result in no reserve remaining at the end of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994&hyph;95 fiscal period.

While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs should be significantly

It is found that the specified expenses for the marketing order covered in this rule are reasonable and likely to be

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule is issued under Marketing Order No. 928 [7 CFR Part 928], as amended, regulating the handling of papayas
grown in Hawaii, hereinafter referred to as the order. This order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement
Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have
retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present
an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or an exemption therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the impact of this rule on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory rules to the scale of business subject to such rules in order that small businesses
will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued
thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on
their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 120 papaya handlers subject to regulation under the marketing order covering fresh papayas
grown in Hawaii, and approximately 400 producers of papayas in Hawaii. Small agricultural producers have been defined
by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small
agricultural service firms as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. A majority of these handlers
and producers may be classified as small entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to &sect;928.120, the committee currently consists of 13 members. Each member has an alternate. Six members
are growers, six are handlers, and one is a public member. The six handler members and alternates are nominated from
the production area at large. Grower membership on the committee is apportioned among three districts. District
1 (the Island of Hawaii) is represented by four members and alternates, and District 2 (the Islands of Kauai, Niihau,
Maui, Molakai, Lanai, Kahoolawe; and Kalawao county), and District 3 (the Island of Oahu) by one member and alternate
each. Any grower organization is limited to two members on the committee. Any handler organization is limited to one
member on the committee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 928.20 also allows the number of grower and handler members and alternate members on the committee and the
composition of the committee between growers and handlers to be changed as provided in &sect;928.31(o). Paragraph
(o) of &sect;928.31 also authorizes the committee, with the approval of the Secretary, to redefine the districts
into which the production area is divided, reapportion membership on the committee. Any such changes are required
to reflect, insofar as practicable, structural changes within the industry and shifts in papaya production within
the production area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule changes the composition of the committee by increasing grower representation on the committee from
six grower members to nine and reducing handler representation from six members to three. This change was recommended
by the committee on April 22, 1994, by a vote of 7 in favor, 3 opposed, and 2 abstentions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The papaya industry has historically demonstrated a policy of maintaining equitable representation among handlers
and growers. In 1989, committee membership was changed by allocating three grower member positions from District
1 to handlers in the State of Hawaii. This resulted in an increase from three to six handler members and a decrease in
grower members from District 1 from seven to four. The committee indicated that the number of growers in the industry
has increased from 325 to 400 since 1989, while the number of handlers has remained constant. The committee contends
that these factors support their recommendation to change committee membership. This action is intended to provide
increased grower representation on the committee consistent with the increased number of growers. This rule will
not impose any additional costs on growers or handlers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Members supporting this change stated that the marketing order is designed to primarily benefit growers and for that
reason growers should have a majority on the committee. Members supporting the recommendation also stated that this
change will increase growers' influence in matters concerning amendments to the marketing order, and market research
and development and promotion activities. The majority of that increase occurred in District 1. Members opposed
to the change in the current committee membership stated that the marketing order should benefit the entire industry,
and believe the current composition of the committee provides a good balance for the industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The committee indicated that the increase in the number of growers producing papayas in District 1, justified increasing
from four to seven the number of growers representing District 1 on the committee. Committee members supporting this
change contend that the vast majority of growers and the highest level of papaya production are located in District
1. District 1 is expected to produce 55.6 million pounds during the 1993&hyph;94 season. Over the last four years District
1 has had an average annual production of 54.1 million pounds of papayas. For the same period District 2 has an average
production of 760,000 pounds, and District 3 has an average production of 1,020,000 pounds of papayas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule concerning this action was published in the September 2, 1994, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 [59 FR 45630], with a 30-day comment period ending October 3, 1994. No comments were received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the available information, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this final rule will not have
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted
by the committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will
tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.

 This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 929 [7 CFR Part 929], as amended, regulating the handling
of cranberries grown in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota,
Oregon, Washington, and Long Island in the State of New York, hereinafter referred to as the ``order''. The order is

The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing order provisions
now in effect, cranberries grown in 10 States are subject to assessments. It is intended that the assessment rate as
issued herein will be applicable to all assessable cranberries during the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year beginning September
1, 1994, through August 31, 1995. This final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies,
unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are approximately 30 handlers of cranberries grown in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey,
Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon, Washington, and Long Island in the State of New York who are subject to regulation
under the cranberry marketing order and approximately 1,050 producers of cranberries in the regulated area. Small
agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual
receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are
less than $5,000,000. The majority of cranberry producers and handlers may be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cranberry marketing order, administered by the Department, requires that the assessment rate for a particular
fiscal year apply to all assessable cranberries handled from the beginning of such year. The budget of expenses for
the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year was prepared by the Committee, the agency responsible for local administration of this
marketing order, and submitted to the Department for approval. The members of the Committee are producers of cranberries.
They are familiar with the Committee's needs and with the costs for goods, services, and personnel in their local area
and are thus in a position to formulate an appropriate budget. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The assessment rate recommended by the Committee was derived by dividing anticipated expenses by expected shipments
of cranberries. Because that rate is applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate which will produce
sufficient income to pay the Committee's expected expenses. The recommended budget and rate of assessment are usually
acted upon by the Committee shortly before a season starts, and expenses are incurred on a continuous basis. Therefore,
the budget and assessment rate approval must be expedited so that the Committee will have funds to pay its expenses.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee conducted a mail vote and unanimously recommended 1994&hyph;95 marketing order expenses of $164,690
and an assessment rate of $0.03 per 100-pound barrel of cranberries. In comparison, 1993&hyph;94 budgeted expenses
were $155,000, with an approved assessment rate of $0.03 per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
100-pound barrel of cranberries. This represents an increase of $9,690 in expenses recommended for this fiscal year,
with the assessment rate remaining unchanged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessment income for 1994&hyph;95 is estimated to total $122,580 based on anticipated fresh domestic shipments
of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4,086,000 barrels of cranberries. The assessment income, plus $3,750 in interest income and a withdrawal of $38,360
from the Committee's authorized reserve fund will be adequate to cover budgeted expenses. Funds in the reserve at
the end of the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year are estimated to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$150,000. The reserve fund will be within the maximum permitted by the order of one fiscal year's expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the
benefits derived from the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined
that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is found that the specified expenses for the marketing order covered in this rule are reasonable and likely to be
incurred and that such expenses and the specified assessment rate to cover such expenses will tend to effectuate the
declared policy of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is further found that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 [5 U.S.C. 553] because the Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous
basis. The 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year for the program began September 1, 1994. The marketing order requires that the
rate of assessment apply to all assessable cranberries handled during the fiscal year. In addition, handlers are
aware of this action which was recommended by the Committee at a public meeting and published in the

 The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final, without change, the provisions of the interim
final rule which authorized expenses and established an assessment rate for the Northwest Fresh Bartlett Pear Marketing
Committee (Committee) under Marketing Order No. 931 for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year. Authorization of this budget
enables the Committee to incur expenses that are reasonable and necessary to administer the program. Funds to administer
the program are derived from assessments on handlers.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement No. 141 and Marketing Order No. 931, both as amended (7 CFR Part 931),
regulating the handling of fresh Bartlett pears grown in Oregon and Washington. The marketing agreement and order
are effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter
referred to as the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing order now
in effect, Bartlett pears grown in Oregon and Washington are subject to assessments. Funds to administer the Bartlett
pear marketing order are derived from such assessments. It is intended that the assessment rate as specified herein
will be applicable to all assessable pears during the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year beginning July 1, 1994, and ends June
30, 1995. This final rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an
irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a
hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district
court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of
business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is
filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and the
rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities
acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are approximately 65 handlers regulated under the marketing order each year and approximately 1,800 producers
of Bartlett pears. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601]
as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose
annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of Bartlett pear handlers and producers in Oregon and Washington
may be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The budget of expenses for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year was prepared by the Committee, the agency responsible for
local administration of the marketing order, and submitted to the Department for approval. The members of the Committee
are producers and handlers of Bartlett pears. They are familiar with the Committee's needs and with the costs for goods
and services in their local area and are thus in a position to formulate an appropriate budget. The budget was formulated
and discussed in a public meeting. Thus, all directly affected persons have had an opportunity to participate and
provide input. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The assessment rate recommended by the Committee was derived by dividing anticipated expenses by expected shipments
of fresh Bartlett pears grown in Oregon and Washington. Because that rate will be applied to actual shipments, it must
be established at a rate that will provide sufficient income to pay the Committee's expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee met on June 2, 1994, and unanimously recommended total expenses of $96,410 with an assessment rate of
$0.02 per standard box or equivalent for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year. In comparison, 1993&hyph;94 budgeted expenses
were $112,425, with an approved assessment rate of $0.025 per standard box or equivalent. This represents a $16,015
decrease in expenses and a $0.005 decrease in the assessment rate from the amounts recommended for the current fiscal
year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The assessment rate, when applied to anticipated pear shipments of 2,721,886 standard boxes or equivalent, will
yield $54,438 in assessment income. Assessment income, combined with $4,000 from other income sources, and $37,972
from the Committee's authorized reserve, will be adequate to cover budgeted expenses. The withdrawal of $37,972
from the Committee's authorized reserve fund will result in no reserve remaining at the end of the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal
year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Major expense categories for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year include $42,683 for salaries, $17,597 for unshared contingency,
and $4,695 in employee health benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the
benefits derived by the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined
that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is found that the specified expenses for the marketing order covered in this rule are reasonable and likely to be
incurred and that such expenses and the specified assessment rate to cover such expenses will tend to effectuate the
declared policy of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 The Department of Agriculture (Department) is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopting as a final rule, with changes, the provisions of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interim final rule amending outgoing inspection regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the California olive marketing order to authorize 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handlers to use in-plant Quality Assurance Programs (QAPs) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in lieu of continuous in-line inspection. This rule also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permits handlers to size whole pitted olives by diameter as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an alternative to the requirement that such olives be sized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by weight prior to pitting. Conforming changes are made to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the size requirements for imported whole pitted olives so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the requirements for domestic and imported olives are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applied similarly. The changes in the California olive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements are designed to result in more efficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handling operations. The changes in import requirements are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary under section 8e of the Agricultural Marketing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agreement Act of 1937.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to imports of those commodities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is issuing this final rule in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12778, Civil Justice Reform. This final rule is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended to have retroactive effect. This final rule will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with law and requesting a modification of the order or to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the district court of the United States in any district in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are no administrative procedures which must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of import regulations issued under section 8e of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact of this final rule on small entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the scale of business subject to such actions in order that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about through group action of essentially small entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entity orientation and compatibility. Import regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issued under the Act are based on those established under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal marketing orders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are 5 handlers of olives regulated under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order, and approximately 1,350 producers in the regulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area. In addition, there are approximately 25 importers of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
olives subject to the requirements of the olive import 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation. Small agricultural producers have been defined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small agricultural service firms, which include olive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handlers and importers, are defined as those whose annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
olive producers and importers may be classified as small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities. None of the olive handlers may be so classified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim final rule was issued on July 21, 1994, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 [59 FR 38104, July 27, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994], with an effective date of July 27, 1994. That rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended &sect;&sect;932.152, and 932.401 of regulations in effect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the order. That rule provided a 30-day comment period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which ended August 26, 1994. No comments were received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The California Olive Committee (committee), the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsible for local administration of the order, met on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
December 14, 1993, and unanimously recommended revising 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outgoing inspection procedures to permit handlers to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish a QAP in lieu of maintaining continuous in-line 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outgoing inspection of processed olives. Outgoing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection is the assignment of a final grade to the product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after processing is completed, according to the requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the U.S. Standards for Grades of Canned Ripe Olives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Standards) [7 CFR 52.3751 to 52.3764]. The committee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also recommended that handlers be allowed to size whole 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pitted olives by diameter after pitting, as an alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the requirement that such olives be sized by weight prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to pitting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to the interim final rule, &sect;932.52 of the order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and &sect;932.152 of the regulations required handlers to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintain continuous in-line outgoing inspection for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handling of processed olives. Also, pursuant to &sect;932.53, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such outgoing inspection is performed by the Processed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Products Branch (PPB) of the Department. Continuous in-line 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outgoing inspection consists of inspection and grading 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services in an approved plant whereby one or more PPB 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspector(s) are present at all times the plant is in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation to make in-process checks on the preparation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing, packing, and warehousing of all products and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assure compliance with sanitary requirements. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs for continuous in-line outgoing inspection have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased in recent years. Thus, the PPB is prepared to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
develop QAP inspection procedures which will provide quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assurance certification for California olive handlers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thereby reducing handlers' inspection costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, most handlers employ their own quality-control personnel. The PPB is prepared to establish QAPs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with individual handlers as provided in the ``Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Governing Inspection and Certification of Processed Fruits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Vegetables and Related Products'' [7 CFR Part 52.2]. As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established, handlers will be permitted to use a QAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection procedure rather than continuous in-line outgoing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection. Under a QAP, the PPB provides training for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handler's quality-control personnel. The handler's quality- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control personnel will be trained in the same procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently used by the PPB inspectors. Once the handler's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality-control personnel are trained to properly perform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the same duties and responsibilities as a PPB inspector, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period of evaluation of the reliability of the handler's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality control responsibilities begins. This is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reliability evaluation period. At such time as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handler's quality-control personnel successfully complete 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the reliability evaluation period, a QAP will begin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation with oversight provided by the PPB. The PPB 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspectors will continue to issue certificates of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection. Certificates of inspection will be based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outgoing inspection records maintained by the handler's QAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personnel. These will be verified through spot-checks and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sample regrading by PPB inspectors. A QAP will continue to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assure safe, wholesome, and uniformly high-quality processed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under a QAP, each handler and the PPB will develop an individually written plan tailored to each handler's facility.
A contract between the handler and the PPB will also be developed based upon the terms of the QAP. The contract will be
signed at the beginning of the reliability evaluation. Once a handler's QAP is approved, the handler is notified in
writing and the PPB begins verifying the work of the handler's QAP personnel. Such verification may include reviews
of plant sanitation, quality and non-quality product analyses, procedures and/or techniques, case-stamping,
checkloading, condition of container, or other types of procedures normally performed by the PPB. Inclusion of any
or all of these verification procedures will be determined by the operating characteristics of each handler's facility
or facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the event deviations from proper QAP procedures are detected by the PPB during the reliability verification process,
the handler will be informed of the problem and corrective action required. If corrective action is taken, the QAP
continues in operation. Continued deviations may result in suspension of QAP approval. The suspension may be permanent
or temporary and may only be restored upon concurrence by the PPB. During any suspension, the handler would be required
to use continuous in-line inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Establishing a QAP inspection procedure meets marketing order inspection requirements, and provides handlers
with an alternative to continuous in-line inspection (which requires the presence of a PPB inspector during final
processing prior to the packaging of olives). To effectuate this change, paragraphs (a) and (b)(1) of &sect;932.152,
Outgoing regulations, are revised to add authority for handlers to use either the QAP process or continuous in-line
inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 932.52 authorizes sizing of whole pitted olives based upon count-per-pound designations (the actual weight
of individual fruit) or modifications recommended by the committee and approved by the Secretary. Prior to the interim
final rule, &sect;932.152 specified that all processed olives must be sized in accordance with the count-per-pound
designations established for canned whole ripe olives, and further required that such sizing be done prior to pitting.
This final rule provides an alternative method for sizing whole pitted olives to provide handlers with more flexibility
in their operations while ensuring that appropriate size standards are continued for whole pitted olives.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Standards provide a method for sizing whole pitted fruit on the basis of illustrations and approximate diameter
ranges (&sect;52.3754, Table I). For example, olives that are ``Jumbo'' in size are those that are approximately
22 to 24 millimeters in diameter and conform closely with the applicable illustration in Table I. The committee believes
that this sizing method may be more appropriate for whole pitted olives, which now account for a substantial majority
of the California olives packaged in the whole form. Thus, this rule authorizes the sizing of whole pitted olives after
pitting in accordance with the illustrations and approximate diameter ranges provided in the Standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Standards also provide allowances for size variances for whole pitted olives in &sect;52.3756. The requirements
of U.S. Grade C (the minimum allowed under the order), provide that of the 60 percent, by count, of the olives that are
most uniform in size, the diameter of the largest olive cannot exceed the diameter of the smallest olive by more than
4 millimeters. These variances will be applied to whole pitted olives when handlers choose to have their pitted olives
sized by diameter, after pitting. The committee believes that these guidelines for sizing whole pitted olives are
sufficient and that no additional specifications relating to size are needed at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To provide for this change in whole pitted olive sizing requirements, paragraph (f) of &sect;932.152 is revised to
add authority for sizing by diameter as provided in the Standards. In addition, paragraph (b)(1) of &sect;932.152
is revised by deleting the sentence which requires sizing prior to pitting. Also, paragraph (b)(2) is revised to reflect
the elimination of the in-line inspection and sizing prior to pitting requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule changes the interim final rule published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 July 27, 1994 [59 FR 38104]. That rule modified Table II in &sect;932.152, paragraph (g)(1), to conform to rule changes
made in 1991. However, further changes were made to Table II in an interim final rule published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on September 13, 1994 [59 FR 46907]. This final rule therefore conforms with the changes in the most recent interim
final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 8e of the Act, olives imported into the United States are subject to comparable size requirements
as established for domestically grown olives under the order. Those requirements are found in Olive Regulation 1
[7 CFR 944.401]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the import regulation, canned pitted ripe olives are subject to minimum size requirements in terms of a minimum
diameter and a specific tolerance for undersized fruit. The undersize tolerances set forth in the import regulation
are based upon those established for canned whole olives under the California olive marketing order.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As previously explained, this final rule establishes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
size requirements for canned pitted olives under the order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in terms of illustrations, approximate diameter ranges, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
size variances which are set forth in the Standards. Thus, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in accordance with section 8e of the Act, conforming changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are made in the minimum size requirements for imported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
canned pitted olives so that such requirements are applied 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a manner similar to that under the order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that this rule will not have a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 8e of the Act, the U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Trade Representative has concurred with the issuance of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant matter presented,

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc.
restricted category military Model UH&hyph;1A, UH&hyph;1B, UH&hyph;1E, UH&hyph;1F, UH&hyph;1H, UH&hyph;1L,
and TH&hyph;1L helicopters, that currently requires an inspection before the first flight of each day of certain
tail rotor drive shafts and the tail rotor drive shaft hanger bearings (bearings) for grease leakage, security, overheat
conditions, binding, or roughness until the bearings are replaced. This amendment requires the same inspection
of the bearings, but also requires replacement of the affected bearings within the next 100 hours time-in-service
and extends the requirements of this AD to the Model UH&hyph;1P and TH&hyph;1F helicopters that were recently type
certificated. This amendment is prompted by an accident involving a bearing failure, and by the certification of
two additional affected helicopter models. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent failure of the
bearing, failure of the tail rotor drive shaft, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On February 5, 1992, the FAA issued Priority Letter (PL) AD 92&hyph;03&hyph;14, applicable to Bell Helicopter Textron,
Inc. (BHTI)-manufactured Model UH&hyph;1A, UH&hyph;1B, UH&hyph;1E, UH&hyph;1F, UH&hyph;1H, UH&hyph;1L, and
TH&hyph;1L helicopters, to require an inspection before the first flight of each day of certain tail rotor
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(T/R) drive shafts and T/R drive shaft hanger bearings (bearings) for grease leakage, security, overheat conditions,
binding, or roughness until the affected bearings are replaced. That action was prompted by an accident involving
a BHTI Model 412 helicopter that experienced a bearing failure. Inspections performed as part of the accident investigation
found metal particles from the manufacturing process in the bearings. Contaminated bearings can seize and stop rotating,
causing the spline coupling shaft to rotate inside the bearing and overheat. That condition, if not corrected, could
result in failure of the bearing, failure of the T/R drive shaft, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the issuance of that AD, the FAA has determined that the affected bearings need to be replaced within the next
100 hours time-in-service in lieu of continued inspections before the first flight of each day as required by the PL
AD. In addition, Type Certificate No. H12NM was issued March 30, 1993, to Western International Aviation, Inc. for
Model UH&hyph;1F, UH&hyph;1P, and TH&hyph;1F helicopters that use the same bearings. Therefore, this AD should
be applicable to these model helicopters. Also, some editorial changes were made to the AD.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other helicopters of the same type
design, this AD supersedes PL AD 92&hyph;03&hyph;14 to require the same inspection of the affected bearings, but
also to require replacement of the affected bearings within the next 100 hours time-in-service. Due to the critical
need to ensure the integrity of the bearings that maintain control of the T/R drive shaft through which power is provided
to the T/R system, to comply with the requirements of this AD before the first flight of each day, and to start the required
inspections on the additionally-affected model helicopters, this rule must be issued immediately to correct an
unsafe condition in the affected helicopters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days.

Comments Invited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this rule must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 93&hyph;SW&hyph;08&hyph;AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and that it is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866.
It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be
significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed
in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') is adopting new Rule 3a12&hyph;11 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'') and amending certain Exchange Act rules to reduce existing regulatory distinctions
between debt securities listed on a national securities exchange and those traded in the over-the-counter market.
The Commission also is simplifying registration procedures under the Exchange Act for listed debt securities. The
new rule and amendments will: exempt listed debt securities from restrictions on borrowing and from most of the proxy
and information statement rules; provide for the automatic effectiveness of Form 8&hyph;A registration statements
for listed debt securities; and eliminate the filing fee associated with Form 8&hyph;A registration statements
for listed debt securities.

In June 1994, the Commission published for comment proposed new Exchange Act Rule 3a12&hyph;11 and certain revisions
to current Exchange Act rules (``Proposing Release'').
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 The proposals were designed to reduce existing regulatory distinctions between debt securities listed on a national
securities exchange and those traded in the over-the-counter (``OTC'') market by exempting listed debt securities
from restrictions on borrowing
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 and proxy and information statement regulation.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission also proposed to simplify registration procedures under the Exchange Act for listed debt securities.
Finally, comment was solicited as to whether it would be advisable to extend reporting requirements to issuers of
debt securities that are traded in the OTC market under certain circumstances where the issuer is not otherwise subject
to periodic reporting requirements.

The Commission received 27 letters of comment from a variety of professional associations, securities firms, corporations
and self-regulatory organizations.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
Most commenters supported the proposed exemptive relief and the simplified Exchange Act registration procedures.
In addition, most commenters supported, or agreed that consideration should be given to, the extension of periodic
reporting requirements to debt issuers in certain circumstances. The issue of extending periodic reporting is still
under consideration by the Commission; the proposed rule and amendments are being adopted as proposed, except for
minor changes as discussed below.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 12 of the Exchange Act
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 requires all securities listed on a national securities exchange to be registered under the Exchange Act.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 Registration subjects the securities, whether debt or equity, to a number of regulatory provisions, including restrictions
on borrowing,
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 periodic reporting by the issuer,
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 and proxy and information statement regulation.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 In contrast, debt securities traded in the OTC market are not required to be registered under the Exchange Act,
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 and, therefore, such securities are not subject to the restrictions on borrowing or proxy and information statement
regulation. These regulatory distinctions may have unnecessarily and unintentionally affected the structure
and development of the debt markets.

The New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') has advised the Commission that the additional regulatory requirements imposed
on listed debt securities create significant disincentives for issuers to list their debt on the national securities
exchanges and urged that exemptive action be taken to eliminate this disparity. To address this disparate regulatory
treatment between listed and OTC-traded debt, the Commission is adopting new Exchange Act Rule 3a12&hyph;11 to exempt
listed debt securities from the borrowing restrictions and most of the proxy and information statement rules. Listed
debt securities, however, will remain subject to the registration and reporting requirements of the Exchange Act.
The Commission also is amending current Exchange Act rules in order to simplify the Exchange Act registration process
by providing for the immediate effectiveness of Form 8&hyph;A registration statements pertaining to the listing
of debt securities on a national securities exchange and eliminating the filing fee associated with the form.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Section 8(a), a broker-dealer can pledge a listed security, other than an exempted security, only to a limited
group of lenders: a member bank of the Federal Reserve System; a non-member bank that has filed with the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System (``Federal Reserve Board'') an agreement to comply with those provisions of the federal
securities and banking laws that apply to member banks;
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 or another broker-dealer if such a loan is permissible under the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board.
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
 There is, however, no comparable limitation on the available lenders for OTC securities. As a result, a broker-dealer
can use bonds that are not listed on an exchange as collateral to secure financing from any lender.

The Commission proposed Rule 3a12&hyph;11(a) in response to concerns voiced by various market participants that
Section 8(a) is overly restrictive and competitively unfair.
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 According to these participants, broker-dealers' discretion in financing their positions is unduly constrained
once a debt security is traded on an exchange. In addition, at least one national securities exchange was informed
by its members that they may advise an issuer against listing bonds due to the restrictions in Section 8(a).
<FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>
 In the Proposing Release, the Commission questioned whether existing regulatory distinctions may have unnecessarily
affected the structure and development of the corporate bond market, without any benefit to investors.

After careful consideration of the issues raised in the Proposing Release and in the comment letters, the Commission
has concluded that differential treatment of listed and OTC debt securities for loan purposes is no longer warranted,
given developments in the OTC market since Congress amended the Exchange Act in the 1960s,
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 the current structure of the bond market,
<FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>
 and the nature of debt financing. The Commission believes that it is appropriate to eliminate this disparity by exempting
listed debt securities from the borrowing restrictions of Section 8(a).
<FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>
 Accordingly, Rule 3a12&hyph;11(a) will enable a broker-dealer to pledge listed debt securities, like debt securities
traded exclusively in the OTC market, to any lender.

Most secondary trading in debt securities (including listed debt securities) currently takes place in the OTC market;
exchange trading of corporate bonds accounts for a relatively small percentage of the daily trading volume in such
securities and is often in ``odd-lot'' size. United States Securities and Exchange Commission, Division of Market
Regulation,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 1, 13 (January 1992). Although these circumstances may change as a result of Rule 3a12&hyph;11(a), the Commission
believes that, at this time, Section 8(a) places a competitive burden on exchange markets by subjecting them to more
restrictive regulation than the primary market for the trading of debt securities, the OTC market.

Section 8(a) specifically excludes exempted securities from the restrictions on the sources of credit available
to broker-dealers borrowing against listed securities. Under Section 3(a)(12) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(12)],
the term ``exempted securities'' includes such securities as the Commission may exempt from the operation of any
one or more provisions of the Exchange Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All 15 commenters that address the restrictions on borrowing, including staff of the Federal Reserve Board, support
an exemption for listed debt securities. Several commenters state that Rule 3a12&hyph;11(a) will provide broker-dealers
with greater flexibility and help them to obtain inventory financing on the most favorable terms. For instance, one
commenter predicts that the new exemption will result in lower financing rates due to an increase in competition among
sources of credit, such as corporations, insurance companies and other currently ineligible lenders.
<FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>
 Others note that broker-dealers will be able to enter into repurchase agreements and other arrangements with non-bank
institutional investors.
<FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>
 Commenters also believe that Rule 3a12&hyph;11(a) will reduce the current disincentive for issuers to list their
debt on a national securities exchange. For these reasons, commenters strongly support exempting listed debt securities
from Section 8(a)'s restrictions on borrowing. Certain commenters, moreover, recommend that the potential benefits
of the exemption be extended to all listed securities, including listed equity securities.

also states that the permissible counterparties under Section 8(a) are not viable lenders, because broker-dealers
are reluctant to disclose their inventory positions to competitors and because banks have higher financing rates
than other kinds of lenders.

Finally, several commenters suggest that further action may be needed to eliminate the restriction in Regulation
T that parallels the statutory restriction in Section 8(a).

 Commenters recommend that the Commission work with the Federal Reserve Board to clarify this matter, and suggest
modifications to the text of the proposed rule to resolve the uncertainty.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission agrees with the commenters that exempting listed debt securities from the Exchange Act's borrowing
restrictions will eliminate an unwarranted regulatory disparity, with possible benefits to the corporate bond
market. First, the Commission believes that Rule 3a12&hyph;11(a) should provide broker-dealers with flexibility
in financing their inventory positions. Specifically, the new rule will enable a broker-dealer borrowing against
a listed debt security to choose among prospective lenders based solely upon the terms of the credit they offer. This
should facilitate, among other things, repurchase agreements with non-bank institutional investors. As a result,
adoption of Rule 3a12&hyph;11(a) may reduce the cost of dealer operations and may encourage broker-dealers to take
positions in listed debt securities, thereby adding depth and liquidity to the corporate bond market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the Commission finds that Rule 3a12&hyph;11(a) should eliminate one competitive barrier to the exchange-trading
of debt securities. As noted in the comment letters, current Section 8(a), among other factors, may provide underwriters
or investment bankers with an incentive to recommend that debt securities be traded in the OTC market, rather than
listed on an exchange. The Commission believes that such an impact on the structure of the debt market is unwarranted.
By equalizing the credit treatment of corporate bonds, adoption of Rule 3a12&hyph;11(a) may provide a greater opportunity
for exchanges to compete with the OTC market for debt listings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has concluded that the modifications suggested by the commenters to conform Regulations T and U with
Rule 3a12&hyph;11(a) are not necessary. In this regard, staff of the Federal Reserve Board has confirmed that the
section of Regulation T discussed by the commenters
<FOOTCITE>27</FOOTCITE>
 and the section of Regulation U governing agreements by non-member banks
<FOOTCITE>28</FOOTCITE>
 were adopted pursuant to Section 8(a).
<FOOTCITE>29</FOOTCITE>
 Federal Reserve Board staff agrees with the Commission that consequently Rule 3a12&hyph;11(a), as proposed and
as adopted, will have the effect of exempting listed debt securities from those provisions of the Federal Reserve
Board's rules.
<FOOTCITE>30</FOOTCITE>
 Federal Reserve Board staff supports the Commission granting such an exemption. Listed debt securities will continue
to be nonexempted securities for all other purposes under Regulations T and U.

Further, the Commission has considered the commenters' suggestion that the exemption from Section 8(a) apply to
all listed securities, debt and equity. The new rules and amendments being adopted today, however, were designed
to achieve competitive balance for the corporate bond market. Consistent with that goal, the Commission proposed
and, at this time, has decided to adopt a rule that is limited to debt securities, rather than significantly change
the exemptive rule by broadening it to cover equity securities. Nevertheless, the treatment of listed equity securities
for loan purposes may warrant further exploration by the Commission and other appropriate regulatory organizations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the definition of the term ``debt security'' for purposes of new Rule 3a12&hyph;11, the Proposing
Release solicited comment as to whether the term should include any security that is not an ``equity security'' as
defined by the Exchange Act and the rules thereunder,
<FOOTCITE>32</FOOTCITE>
 or whether the term should be more specifically defined.
<FOOTCITE>33</FOOTCITE>
 Commenters supported the broader definition primarily because of the risk that certain innovative securities may
not fit squarely within pre-conceived categories. Given this concern, as well as the desire of the Commission to simplify
an issuer's determination as to whether a debt or equity security is at issue, new Rule 3a12&hyph;11 provides that
the term ``debt security'' will include any security that is not an ``equity security'' as defined by the Exchange
Act and the rules thereunder.

thereunder. Equity securities would include, among other items, stock or similar security, certificates of interest

The Proposing Release also solicited comment as to whether hybrid debt securities should be considered as debt or

consideration, the Commission believes that no further clarification regarding hybrid securities is necessary;
if a security is not an equity security as defined by the Exchange Act and the rules thereunder, then the security will
be considered a ``debt security'' for purposes of Rule 3a12&hyph;11.

C. Exemption from Compliance with the Proxy Rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed above, debt securities listed on a national securities exchange are subject to proxy regulation while
debt securities traded in the OTC market, the principal trading market for debt securities,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
36
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 are not. The disparate application of the proxy rules between listed debt securities and OTC-traded debt securities
reflected the nature of the debt markets in the 1960s when Congress amended the Exchange Act;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
37
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 this difference in regulatory treatment is cited by some as a significant disincentive for corporate issuers to list
their debt securities on a national securities exchange.

needed for the OTC market.

 (``1963 Special Study'') U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, H.R. Doc. No. 95, 88th Cong., 1st Sess. pt. 3, 34
(1963). These recommendations led to the adoption of Section 12(g) in 1964. The Commission concluded that proxy regulation
should not be required with respect to debt securities since Section 14 was designed to protect shareholders and the
solicitation of proxies was ``rarely [a] problem[ ] related to debt securities and, then, most probably in insolvency
cases where other protections are available.''

To eliminate the disparity, the Commission proposed Rule 3a12&hyph;11(b) to exempt debt securities listed on a national
securities exchange from proxy regulation, but solicited comment as to whether the antifraud proscriptions
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

 The majority of commenters favored the proposed rule. With respect to listed debt securities, the proxy rules largely

amendment of the indenture contract, and therefore, unlike shareholders, debtholders do not need the protection
of the proxy rules.

In addition to the protections supplied by the indenture contract and the Trust Indenture Act, debtholders will continue
to be protected by the proxy rules' antifraud proscriptions and the Exchange Act rules that facilitate the transmission
of materials to beneficial owners. The Commission has determined that any exemptive relief from the proxy rules should
not encompass the antifraud proscriptions or the rules relating to the transmission of materials to beneficial owners.
The antifraud proscriptions provide protection to investors without placing any undue burden upon the issuer. Further,
the rules relating to the transmission of materials to beneficial owners not only provide protection to investors
but also benefit the issuer by facilitating its ability to communicate directly with its debtholders. Accordingly,
new Rule 3a12&hyph;11(b) will exempt exchange-listed debt securities
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
43
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 from proxy regulation, except that the antifraud proscriptions and the rules adopted under the Exchange Act to facilitate
the transmission of materials to beneficial owners will continue to apply. The foregoing provisions, coupled with
the issuer's reporting obligation under the Exchange Act, should ensure that investors remain protected.

The Proposing Release solicited comment as to whether the application of the proxy rules was part of the expectations
of the parties negotiating the indenture contract, or of investors purchasing a listed debt security, and if so, whether
the proxy rule exemption should be applied prospectively. Only one commenter addressed the issue.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 That commenter believed that there is no need for a prospective application of the exemption since debtholders do
not normally expect the proxy rules to apply. Since the Commission desires to eliminate unnecessary regulatory disparity
as expeditiously as possible and given the other protections afforded debtholders as discussed above, the proxy
rule exemption is not limited to issues of debt offered subsequent to the adoption of the exemption.

See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section I.D of Release No. 34&hyph;34139. The Division of Corporation Finance will accept requests from national
securities exchanges that wish to file a combined Form 8&hyph;A/Listing Application with the Commission on behalf
of an issuer listing debt securities on their exchange. Any national securities exchange that is interested in filing
a combined Form 8&hyph;A/Listing Application should have its representative contact Joseph P. Babits at (202) 942&hyph;2910.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A national securities exchange using such a procedure may wish to make Form 8&hyph;A filings with the Commission in
paper, whether or not the registrant is subject to mandated electronic filing via the Electronic Data Gathering,
Analysis, and Retrieval system (EDGAR). Accordingly, the Division of Corporation Finance will consider requests
for a continuing hardship exemption pursuant to Rule 202 of Regulation S&hyph;T [17 CFR 232.202] from any national
securities exchange filing Forms 8&hyph;A on behalf of electronic filers. Continuing hardship exemptions will
be available only through December 31, 1996. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National securities exchanges that intend to use a combined Form 8&hyph;A/Listing Application that will become
effective upon filing must confirm that the combined Form has been in fact filed with the Commission prior to the commencement
of trading in the class of securities. The issuer, however, may choose to file the Form 8&hyph;A itself. Regardless
of whether the issuer or the national securities exchange files the Form 8&hyph;A/Listing Application, the issuer
is solely responsible for the filing and its contents.

Several commenters, while supporting these proposals, stated that the Commission should go further and not require
Section 12 registration for issuers of debt securities subject to the reporting requirement of Section 13(a) of the
Exchange Act. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
See, e.g.,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All Forms 8&hyph;A, including amendments, pertaining to the registration of a class of debt securities to be listed
on a national securities exchange will be automatically effective if certification by the national securities exchange
has been received by the Commission on or before the filing of the form.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
47
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 However, where a Form 8&hyph;A is registering a class of debt securities and securities from that class are being concurrently
registered under the Securities Act, the Form 8&hyph;A will not automatically become effective upon filing, so that
the debt securities will not become subject to any obligations under the Exchange Act prior to the related Securities
Act registration statement being declared effective. Instead, as proposed, where there is a concurrent Securities
Act registration statement pending, the Form 8&hyph;A will become effective simultaneously with the effectiveness
of the Securities Act registration statement. Acceleration requests no longer will be needed for either of these
categories of Form 8&hyph;A.

If an issuer elects to file the Form 8&hyph;A (or Form 8&hyph;A/Listing Application) itself, it must ensure that the
Commission has received certification from the exchange on or before the date of filing the Form if automatic effectiveness
is requested, or, if concurrent effectiveness is requested, on or before the date the Securities Act registration
statement has been declared effective. An issuer may contact the Office of Quality Control at (202) 942&hyph;8970
(ext. 4475) to verify that certification has been received by the Commission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If multiple debt issues are being registered on a single Form 8&hyph;A, certification for each issue must be received
by the Commission prior to effectiveness. Where a Form 8&hyph;A relates to debt securities to be listed on multiple
national securities exchanges (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 the NYSE and the Boston Stock Exchange), then certifications must be received by the Commission from each exchange
prior to effectiveness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Forms 8&hyph;A that register both debt and equity securities are not encompassed by the amendments.

Similarly, no effectiveness orders will be issued for Forms 8&hyph;A, as is the case with other registration statements
that are effective automatically (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the Commission is amending Rule 12b&hyph;7 to eliminate the $250 filing fee for registering a class of
debt securities on Form 8&hyph;A.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
49
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Form 8&hyph;A has been revised to add two new boxes, one of which the issuer would check to signify it is a debt registration
requiring no fee and that the Form 8&hyph;A: (1) Is to be effective automatically upon filing, as no debt securities
of the class being registered on the form are being registered concurrently under the Securities Act; or (2) is to be
effective simultaneously with the effectiveness of a related Securities Act registration statement. In order to
receive automatic or concurrent effectiveness, the appropriate box must be checked.

Given the de minimis nature of the filing fee, it is of little significance in an issuer's decision to list securities.
However, its elimination is consistent with the Commission's goal of eliminating regulatory disparity between
listed and unlisted debt securities where not necessary for the protection of investors. The NYSE requires a listing
fee for debt securities of $50 per million and minimum of $2,500 for new issues and $25 per million and minimum of $1,250
for issue outstanding one year or more. The fee does not apply if the company or its affiliate already has a class of equity
securities listed on the NYSE.

Registrants that are mandated electronic filers registering debt securities on Form 8&hyph;A should file in paper
format until the necessary form types are available through the EDGAR system. The necessary form types are expected
to be available with the release of the EDGARLink software version 4.10 in January 1995. Notice will be provided in
the SEC Digest and the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 and on the EDGAR Bulletin Board when the new EDGAR form types for Form 8&hyph;A are available. When available, registrants
will use one of three new EDGAR form types: 8A12BEF (Form 8&hyph;A and amendments to Form 8&hyph;A registering debt
securities that will be automatically effective upon filing), 8A12BT (Form 8&hyph;A registering debt securities
that will be effective contemporaneously with the effectiveness of an associated Securities Act registration statement),
or 8A12BT/A (amendment to Form 8&hyph;A registering debt securities that will be effective contemporaneously with
the effectiveness of an associated Securities Act registration statement).

III. Cost-Benefit Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No empirical data was submitted in response to the Commission's invitation to provide information on the costs and
benefits of the proposed new Exchange Act rule and Exchange Act rule revisions. The rule and amendments should decrease
the net costs to investors associated with listing debt securities on a national securities exchange, without materially
diminishing the benefits to investors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, an issuer is not required to register debt securities under the Exchange Act in order for those securities
to be traded in the OTC market. Consequently, OTC-traded debt securities are not subject to either the restrictions
on borrowing or proxy regulation. New Rule 3a12&hyph;11 is designed to eliminate the disparity between exchange-listed
debt securities and OTC-traded debt securities by exempting listed debt securities from the restrictions on borrowing
and proxy regulation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendments to the Exchange Act rules are expected to reduce or eliminate some of the procedural costs of listing
debt on a national securities exchange. It is anticipated that the costs to investors associated with this new rule
and amendments will be minimal.

IV. Summary of Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has been prepared in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 604 for Rule 3a12&hyph;11 and
amendments to Rule 12b&hyph;7, 12d1&hyph;2, and Form 8&hyph;A. The analysis notes that the rule and amendments are
expected to reduce regulatory costs for small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed more fully in the analysis, the new rule and amendments will affect persons that are small entities, as
defined by the Commission's rules. The exemptions provided by Rule 3a12&hyph;11 and revisions to Rules 12b&hyph;7,
12d1&hyph;2, and Form 8&hyph;A are expected to decrease the compliance burdens of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A copy of the analysis may be obtained by contacting Joseph P. Babits, Office of Disclosure Policy, Division of Corporation
Finance, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, D.C. 20549.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Effective Date and Transition Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rule and amendments are effective 30 days after publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, in accordance with the Administrative Procedures Act; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however, any registrant or broker-dealer may choose to comply with the new rules at any time after publication in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. To provide for a smooth transition for use of the new rule and amendments, the following transition provisions will
be permitted. First, registrants that have proxy statements relating to a solicitation of debtholders pending with
the Commission should contact the registrant's Branch Chief in the Division of Corporation Finance if they intend
to rely on the proxy exemption afforded by the rule, so that the staff may stop processing the filing. Second, issuers
that have Form 8&hyph;A registration statements for listed debt securities pending with the Commission should continue
to follow the current procedures regarding acceleration of effectiveness of Forms 8&hyph;A. As is currently the
case, those issuers or the national securities exchange on which the debt securities are to be listed must provide
the staff with an acceleration request prior to the desired effective date of the Form 8&hyph;A. The staff will then
notify the issuer and the national securities exchange once effectiveness has been granted.

Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Director, Administration and Management, Office of the Secretary of Defense has determined that this Privacy
Act rule for the Department of Defense does not constitute `significant regulatory action'. Analysis of the rule
indicates that it does not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; does not create a serious inconsistency
or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; does not materially alter the budgetary
impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof;
does not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in Executive Order 12866 (1993).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is the policy of Department of the Navy to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Ensure that all its personnel comply fully with 5 U.S.C. 552a, DoD Directive 5400.11 and DoD 5400.11&hyph;R, to
protect individuals from unwarranted invasions of privacy. Individuals covered by this protection are living citizens
of the U.S. or aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence. A legal guardian of an individual or parent of a minor
when acting on the individual's or minor's behalf, has the same rights as the individual or minor. (A member of the Armed
Forces is not a minor for the purposes of this subpart and subpart G of this part).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Collect, maintain, and use only that personal information needed to support a Navy function or program as authorized
by law or E.O., and disclose this information only as authorized by 5 U.S.C. 552a and this subpart and subpart G of this
part. In assessing need, consideration shall be given to alternatives, such as use of information not individually
identifiable or use of sampling of certain data for certain individuals only. Additionally, consideration is to
be given to the length of time information is needed, and the cost of maintaining the information compared to the risks
and adverse consequences of not maintaining the information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Keep only personal information that is timely, accurate, complete, and relevant to the purpose for which it was
collected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Let individuals have access to, and obtain copies of, all or portions of their records, subject to exemption procedures
authorized by law and this subpart and subpart G of this part.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Let individuals request amendment of their records when discrepancies proven to be erroneous, untimely, incomplete,
or irrelevant are noted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Let individuals request an administrative review of decisions that deny them access, or refuse to amend their
records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Ensure that adequate safeguards are enforced to prevent misuse, unauthorized disclosure, alteration, or destruction
of personal information in records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Maintain no records describing how an individual exercises his or her rights guaranteed by the First Amendment
(freedom of religion, political beliefs, speech, and press; peaceful assemblage; and petition for redress of grievances),
unless they are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Expressly authorized by statute;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Authorized by the individual;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Within the scope of an authorized law enforcement activity; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) For the maintenance of certain items of information relating to religious affiliation for members of the naval
service who are chaplains. This should not be construed, however, as restricting or excluding solicitation of information
which the individual is willing to have in his or her record concerning religious preference, particularly that required
in emergency situations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Maintain only systems of records which have been published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, in accordance with periodic Chief of Naval Operations Notes (OPNAVNOTEs) 5211 and &sect;701.105. These OPNAVNOTEs
5211 provide a listing of all Department of the Navy Privacy Act systems of records and identify the Office of Personnel
Management (OPM) government-wide systems containing information on Department of the Navy civilian employees,
even though technically, Department of the Navy does not have cognizance over them. A Privacy Act systems notice outlines
what kinds of information may be collected and maintained by naval activities. When collecting/maintaining information
in a Privacy Act system of records, review the systems notice to ensure activity compliance is within the scope of the
system. If you determine the systems notice does not meet your needs, contact the systems manager or Chief of Naval
Operations (N09B30) with your concerns so that amendment of the system may be considered.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Records in a group of records that are not retrieved by personal identifiers are not covered by this subpart and
subpart G of this part, even if the records contain information about individuals and are under the control of Department
of the Navy. The records must be retrieved by personal identifiers to become a system of records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If records previously not retrieved by personal identifiers are rearranged so they are retrieved by personal
identifiers, a new system notice must be submitted in accordance with &sect;701.107.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If records in a system of records are rearranged so retrieval is no longer by personal identifiers, the records
are no longer subject to this subpart and subpart G of this part and the records system notice should be deleted in accordance
with &sect;701.107.

Recordkeeping standards. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A record maintained in a system of records subject to this subpart and subpart G of this part must meet the following
criteria:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Be accurate. All information in the record must be factually correct.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Be relevant. All information contained in the record must be related to the individual who is the record subject
and also must be related to a lawful purpose or mission of the Department of the Navy activity maintaining the record.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Be timely. All information in the record must be reviewed periodically to ensure that it has not changed due to time
or later events.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Be complete. It must be able to stand alone in accomplishing the purpose for which it is maintained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Be necessary. All information in the record must be needed to accomplish a Department of the Navy mission or purpose
established by Federal Law or E.O. of the President.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Authority to establish systems of records. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Identify the specific Federal statute or E.O. of the President that authorizes maintaining each system of records.
When a naval activity uses its ``internal housekeeping'' statute, i.e., 5 U.S.C. 301, Departmental Regulations,
the naval instruction that implements the statute should also be identified. A statute or E.O. authorizing a system
of records does not negate the responsibility to ensure the information in the system of records is relevant and necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Exercise of First Amendment rights.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Do not maintain any records describing how an individual exercises rights guaranteed by the First Amendment of
the U.S. Constitution unless expressly authorized by Federal law; the individual; or pertinent to and within the
scope of an authorized law enforcement activity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) First amendment rights include, but are not limited to, freedom of religion, freedom of political beliefs, freedom
of speech, freedom of the press, the right to assemble, and the right to petition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
System manager's evaluations and reviews.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Evaluate each new system of records. Before establishing a system of records, evaluate the information to be included
and consider the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The relationship of each item of information to be collected and retained to the purpose for which the system is
maintained (all information must be relevant to the purpose);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The specific impact on the purpose or mission if each category of information is not collected (all information
must be necessary to accomplish a lawful purpose or mission.);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The ability to meet the informational needs without using personal identifiers (will anonymous statistical
records meet the needs?);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The length of time each item of information must be kept;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The methods of disposal; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) The cost of maintaining the information; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) Whether a system already exists that serves the purpose of the new system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Evaluate and review all existing systems of records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) When an alteration or amendment of an existing system is prepared pursuant to &sect;701.107(b) and (c), do the
evaluation described in &sect;701.105(e).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Conduct the following reviews annually and be prepared to report, in accordance with &sect;701.104(c)(8),
the results and corrective actions taken to resolve problems uncovered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Training practices to ensure all personnel are familiar with the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a, and DoD Directive
5400.11, ``DoD Privacy Program'', this subpart and subpart G of this part, and any special needs their specific jobs
entail.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Recordkeeping and disposal practices to ensure compliance with this subpart and subpart G of this part.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Ongoing computer matching programs in which records from the system have been matched with non-DoD records to
ensure that the requirements of &sect;701.115 have been met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Actions of Department of the Navy personnel that resulted in either Department of the Navy being found civilly
liable or a person being found criminally liable under 5 U.S.C. 552a, to determine the extent of the problem and find
the most effective way of preventing the problem from occurring in the future.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) Each system of records notice to ensure it accurately describes the system. Where major changes are needed, alter
the system notice in accordance with &sect;701.107(b). If minor changes are needed, amend the system notice pursuant
to &sect;701.107(c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Every even-numbered year, review a random sample of Department of the Navy contracts that provide for the operation
of a system of records to accomplish a Department of the Navy function, to ensure the wording of each contract complies
with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a and &sect;701.105(h).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Every three years, beginning in 1992, review the routine use disclosures associated with each system of records
to ensure the recipient's use of the records continues to be compatible with the purpose for which the information
was originally collected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Every three years, beginning in 1993, review each system of records for which exemption rules have been established
to determine whether each exemption is still needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) When directed, send the reports through proper channels to the CNO (N09B30).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discontinued information requirements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Immediately stop collecting any category or item of information about individuals that is no longer justified,
and when feasible, remove the information from existing records.

Review records before disclosing outside the Federal government.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Before disclosing a record from a system of records to anyone outside the Federal government, take reasonable steps
to ensure the record which is being disclosed is accurate, relevant, timely, and complete for the purposes it is being
maintained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Federal government contractors.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Applicability to Federal government contractors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) When a naval activity contracts for the operation of a system of records to accomplish its function, the activity
must ensure compliance with this subpart and subpart G of this part and 5 U.S.C. 552a. For the purposes of the criminal
penalties described in 5 U.S.C. 552a, the contractor and its employees shall be considered employees of the agency
during the performance of the contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Consistent with Parts 24 and 52 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), contracts for the operation of a
system of records shall identify specifically the record system and the work to be performed, and shall include in
the solicitations and resulting contract the terms as prescribed by the FAR.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If the contractor must use records that are subject to this subpart and subpart G of this part to perform any part
of a contract, the contractor activities are subject to this subpart and subpart G of this part.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) This subpart and subpart G of this part do not apply to records of a contractor that are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Established and maintained solely to assist the contractor in making internal contractor management decisions,
such as records maintained by the contractor for use in managing the contract;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Maintained as internal contractor employee records, even when used in conjunction with providing goods or services
to the naval activity;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Maintained as training records by an educational organization contracted by a naval activity to provide training
when the records of the contract students are similar to and commingled with training records of other students, such
as admission forms, transcripts, and academic counseling and similar records; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Maintained by a consumer reporting agency to which records have been disclosed under contract in accordance with
31 U.S.C. 952d.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) For contracting that is subject to this subpart and subpart G of this part, naval activities shall publish instructions
that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Furnish Privacy Act guidance to personnel who solicit, award, or administer Government contracts;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Inform prospective contractors of their responsibilities under this subpart and subpart G of this part and the
Department of the Navy Privacy Program;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Establish an internal system for reviewing contractor's performance for compliance with the Privacy Act; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Provide for the biennial review of a random sample of contracts that are subject to this subpart and subpart G of
this part.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Contracting procedures. The Defense Acquisition Regulatory (DAR) Council, which oversees the implementation
of the FAR within the Department of Defense, is responsible for developing the specific policies and procedures for
soliciting, awarding, and administering contracts that are subject to this subpart and subpart G of this part and
5 U.S.C. 552a.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Contractor compliance. Naval activities shall establish contract surveillance programs to ensure contractors
comply with the procedures established by the DAR Council under the preceding subparagraph.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Disclosing records to contractors. Disclosing records to a contractor for use in performing a contract let by
a naval activity is considered a disclosure within Department of the Navy. The contractor is considered the agent
of Department of the Navy when receiving and maintaining the records for that activity.

Safeguarding records in systems of records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Establish appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the records in every system
of records are protected from unauthorized alteration, destruction, or disclosure. Protect the records from reasonably
anticipated threats or hazards that could result in substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness
to any individual on whom information is maintained.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Minimum standards.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Conduct risk analysis and management planning for each system of records. Consider sensitivity and use of the
records, present and projected threats and vulnerabilities, and present and projected cost-effectiveness of safeguards.
The risk analysis may vary from an informal review of a small, relatively insensitive system to a formal, fully quantified
risk analysis of a large, complex, and highly sensitive system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Train all personnel operating a system of records or using records from a system of records in proper record security
procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Label information exempt from disclosure under this subpart and subpart G of this part to reflect their sensitivity,
such as ``FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY,'' ``PRIVACY ACT SENSITIVE: DISCLOSE ON A NEED-TO-KNOW BASIS ONLY,'' or some other
statement that alerts individuals of the sensitivity to the records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Administer special administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect records processed or stored
in an automated data processing or word processing system to protect them from threats unique to those environments.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Records disposal.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Dispose of records from systems of records so as to prevent inadvertent disclosure. Disposal methods are considered
adequate if the records are rendered unrecognizable or beyond reconstruction (i.e., such as tearing, burning, melting,
chemical decomposition, burying, pulping, pulverizing, shredding, or mutilation). Magnetic media may be cleared
by completely erasing, overwriting, or degaussing the tape.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The transfer of large volumes of records (e.g., printouts and computer cards) in bulk to a disposal activity such
as a Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office for authorized disposal is not a disclosure of records, if the volume
of records, coding of the information, or some other factor render it impossible to recognize any personal information
about a specific individual.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) When disposing or destroying large quantities of records from a system of records, care must be taken to ensure
that the bulk of the records is maintained to prevent easy identification of specific records. If such bulk is maintained,
no special procedures are required. If bulk is not maintained, or if the form of the records makes individually identifiable
information easily discernable, dispose of the records in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Criteria for a new system of records. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A new system of records is one for which no existing system notice has been published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If a notice for a system of records has been canceled or deleted, and it is determined that it should be reinstated or
reused, a new system notice must be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Advance public notice must be given before a naval activity may begin to collect information for or use a new system
of records. The following procedures apply:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Describe in the record system notice the contents of the record system and the purposes and routine uses for which
the information will be used and disclosed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The public shall be given 30 days to comment on any proposed routine uses before the routine uses are implemented.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The notice shall contain the date the system of records will become effective.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Criteria for an alteration to a system of records notice. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A system is considered altered when any one of the following actions occur or is proposed:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A significant increase or change in the number or types of individuals about whom records are maintained. For example,
a decision to expand a system of records that originally covered personnel assigned to only one naval activity to cover
personnel at several installations would constitute an altered system. An increase or decrease in the number of individuals
covered due to normal growth or decrease is not an alteration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A change that expands the types or categories of information maintained. For example, a personnel file that has

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been expanded to include medical records would be an alteration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A change that alters the purpose for which the information is used. In order to be an alteration, the change must
be one that is not reasonably inferred from any of the existing purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A change to equipment configuration (either hardware or software) that creates substantially greater use of
records in the system. For example, placing interactive computer terminals at regional offices when the system was
formerly used only at the headquarters would be an alteration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) A change in the manner in which records are organized or in the method by which records are retrieved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Combining record systems due to a reorganization within Department of the Navy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Retrieving by Social Security Numbers (SSNs), records that previously were retrieved only by names would be an
alteration if the present notice failed to indicate retrieval by SSNs. An altered system of records must be published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Submission for an alteration must contain a narrative statement, the specific changes altering the system, and
the system of records notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Criteria for amending a systems of records notice. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Minor changes to published system of records notices are considered amendments. All amendments should be forwarded
to CNO (N09B30) for publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. When submitting an amendment to a system of records notice, the naval activity must include a description of the specific
changes proposed and the system of records notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Criteria for deleting a system of records notice. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When a system of records is discontinued, incorporated into another system, or determined to be no longer subject
to this subpart and subpart G of this part, a deletion notice must be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The deletion notice shall include the system identification number, system name, and the reason for deleting it.
If a system is deleted through incorporation into or merger with another system, identify the successor system in
the deletion notice.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Collecting directly from the individual.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 To the greatest extent practicable, collect information for systems of records directly from the individual to whom
the record pertains if the record may be used to make an adverse determination about the individual's rights, benefits,
or privileges under the Federal programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Collecting information about individuals from third persons. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It might not always be practical to collect all information about an individual directly from that person, such as
verifying information through other sources for security or employment suitability determinations; seeking other
opinions, such as a supervisor's comments on past performance or other evaluations; obtaining the necessary information
directly from the individual would be exceptionally difficult or would result in unreasonable costs or delays; or,
the individual requests or consents to contacting another person to obtain the information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Soliciting the social security number (SSN).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) It is unlawful for any Federal, State, or local government agency to deny an individual a right, benefit, or privilege
provided by law because the individual refuses to provide his or her SSN. However, this prohibition does not apply
if a Federal law requires that the SSN be provided, or the SSN is required by a law or regulation adopted before January
1, 1975, to verify the individual's identity for a system of records established and in use before that date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Before requesting an individual to provide the SSN, the individual must be advised whether providing the SSN is
mandatory or voluntary; by what law or other authority the SSN is solicited; and what uses will be made of the SSN.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The preceding advice relates only to the SSN. If other information about the individual is solicited for a system
of records, a Privacy Act statement (PAS) also must be provided to him/her. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for each system of records containing SSNs solicited from individuals must indicate the authority for soliciting
the SSNs and whether it is mandatory for the individuals to provide their SSNs. E.O. 9397 requires federal agencies
to use SSNs as numerical identifiers for individuals in most federal records systems, however, it does not make it
mandatory for individuals to provide their SSNs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) When entering military service or civilian employment with the Department of the Navy, individuals must provide
their SSNs. This is then the individual's numerical identifier and is used to establish personnel, financial, medical,
and other official records (as authorized by E.O. 9397). The individuals must be given the notification described
above. Once the individual has provided his or her SSN to establish the records, a notification is not required when
the SSN is requested only for identification or to locate the records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The Federal Personnel Manual
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 must be consulted when soliciting SSNs for use in systems of records maintained by the Office of Personnel Management.

(7) A Department of the Navy activity may request an individual's SSN even though it is not required by Federal statute,
or is not for a system of records in existence and operating prior to January 1, 1975. However, the separate Privacy
Act Statement for the SSN, alone, or a merged Privacy Act Statement covering both the SSN and other items of personal
information, must make clear that disclosure of the number is voluntary. If the individual refuses to disclose his
or her SSN, the activity must be prepared to identify the individual by alternate means.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) When an individual is requested to furnish information about himself/herself for a system of records, a Privacy
Act Statement must be provided to the individual, regardless of the method used to collect the information (i.e.,
forms, personal or telephonic interview, etc). If the information requested will not be included in a system of records,
a Privacy Act Statement is not required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Privacy Act Statement shall include the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The Federal law or E.O. that authorizes collecting the information (i.e., E.O. 9397 authorizes collection of
SSNs);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Whether or not it is mandatory for the individual to provide the requested information (It is only mandatory when
a Federal law or E.O. of the President specifically imposes a requirement to furnish the information and provides
a penalty for failure to do so. If furnishing information is a condition for granting a benefit or privilege voluntarily
sought by the individual, it is voluntary for the individual to give the information.);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The principle purposes for collecting the information;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The routine uses that will be made of the information (i.e., to whom and why it will be disclosed outside the Department
of Defense); and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The possible effects on the individual if the requested information is not provided.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The Privacy Act Statement must appear on the form used to collect the information or on a separate form that can be
retained by the individual collecting the information. If the information is collected by means other than a form
completed by the individual, i.e., solicited over the telephone, the Privacy Act Statement should be read to the individual
and if requested by the individual, a copy sent to him/her. There is no requirement that the individual sign the Privacy
Act Statement. (e)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When forms are used to collect information about individuals for a system of records, the Privacy Act Statement shall
appear as follows (listed in the order of preference):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Immediately below the title of the form,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Elsewhere on the front page of the form (clearly indicating it is the Privacy Act Statement),
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) On the back of the form with a notation of its location below the title of the form, or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) On a separate form which the individual may keep.

&sect;701.109 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->
Access to records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Individual access to records.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Right of access. Only individuals who are subjects of records maintained in systems of records and by whose personal
identifiers the records are retrieved have the right of individual access under this subpart and subpart G of this
part, unless they provide written authorization for their representative to act on their behalf. Legal guardians
or parents acting on behalf of a minor child also have the right of individual access under this subpart and subpart
G of this part.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Notification of record's existence. Each naval activity shall establish procedures for notifying an individual,
in response to his or her request, if a system of records identified by him/her contains a record pertaining to the individual.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Individual request for access. Individuals shall address requests for access to records in systems of records
to the system manager or the office designated in the Department of the Navy compilation of system notices (periodic
Chief of Naval Operations Notes (OPNAVNOTEs) 5211, ``Current Privacy Act Issuances'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Verifying identity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) An individual shall provide reasonable verification of identity before obtaining access to records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) When requesting records in writing, naval activities may not insist that a requester submit a notarized signature.
The courts have ruled that an alternative method of verifying identity must be established for individuals who do
not have access to notary services. This alternative permits requesters to provide an unsworn declaration that states
``I declare under perjury or penalty under the laws of the United States of American that the foregoing is true and correct.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) When an individual seeks access in person, identification can be verified by documents normally carried by
the individual (i.e., identification card, driver's license, or other license, permit or pass normally used for
identification purposes).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) When access is requested other than in writing, identity may be verified by the individual's providing minimum
identifying data such as full name, date and place of birth, or other information necessary to locate the record sought.
If the information sought is sensitive, additional identifying data may be required. Telephonic requests should
not be honored.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Allow an individual to be accompanied by a person of his or her choice when viewing the record; however, require
the individual to provide written authorization to have the record discussed in front of the other person.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Do not deny access to an individual who is the subject of the record solely for refusing to divulge his or her SSN,
unless it is the only means of retrieving the record or verifying identity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) Do not require the individual to explain why he or she is seeking access to a record under this subpart and subpart
G of this part.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) Only a designated denial authority may deny access. The denial must be in writing and contain the information
required by &sect;701.109(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Blanket requests not honored. Do not honor requests from individuals for notification and/or access concerning
all Department of the Navy systems of records. In these instances, notify the individual that requests for notification
and/or access must be directed to the appropriate system manager for the particular record system being requested,
as indicated in the periodic Chief of Naval Operations Notes (OPNAVNOTEs) 5211, ``Current Privacy Act Issuances'';
and the request must either designate the particular system of records to be searched, or provide sufficient information
for the system manager to identify the appropriate system. Also, provide the individual with any other information
needed for obtaining consideration of his or her request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Granting individual access to records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Grant the individual access to the original record (or exact copy) without any changes or deletions, other than
those made in accordance with &sect;701.113.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Grant the individual's request for an exact copy of the record, upon the signed authorization of the individual,
and provide a copy to anyone designated by the individual. In either case, the copying fees may be assessed to the individual
pursuant to &sect;701.109(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If requested, explain any record or portion of a record that is not understood, as well as any changes or deletions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Illegible or incomplete records. Do not deny an individual access solely because the physical condition or format
of the record does not make it readily available (i.e., when the record is in a deteriorated state or on magnetic tape).
Either prepare an extract or recopy the document exactly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Access by parents and legal guardians.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The parent of any minor, or the legal guardian of any individual declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to
be incompetent due to physical or mental incapacity or age, may obtain access to the record of the minor or incompetent
individual if the parent or legal guardian is acting on behalf or for the benefit of the minor or incompetent. However,
with respect to access by parents and legal guardians to medical records and medical determinations about minors,
use the following procedures:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) In the United States, the laws of the state where the records are located might afford special protection to certain
medical records (i.e., drug and alcohol abuse treatment, and psychiatric records). The state statutes might apply
even if the records are maintained by a naval medical facility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) For installations located outside the U.S., the parent or legal guardian of a minor shall be denied access if all
four of the following conditions are met:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The minor at the time of the treatment or consultation was 15, 16, or 17 years old;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The treatment or consultation was within a program authorized by law or regulation to provide confidentiality to
the minor;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The minor indicated a desire that the treatment or consultation record be handled in confidence and not disclosed
to a parent or guardian; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The parent or legal guardian does not have the written authorization of the minor or a valid court order granting access.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A minor or incompetent has the same right of access as any other individual under this subpart and subpart G of this
part. The right of access of the parent or legal guardian is in addition to that of the minor or incompetent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Access to information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil proceeding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) An individual is not entitled under this subpart and subpart G of this part to access information compiled in reasonable
anticipation of a civil action or proceeding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The term ``civil action or proceeding'' includes quasi-judicial and pre-trial judicial proceedings, as well
as formal litigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Section 701.109(9)(i) and (ii) do not prohibit access to records compiled or used for purposes other than litigation,
nor prohibit access to systems of records solely because they are frequently subject to litigation. The information
must have been compiled for the primary purpose of litigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) Personal notes or records not under the control of the Department of the Navy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Certain documents under the control of a Department of the Navy employee and used to assist him/her in performing
official functions are not considered Department of the Navy records within the meaning of this subpart and subpart
G of this part. These documents are not systems of records that are subject to this subpart and subpart G of this part,
if they are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Maintained and discarded solely at the discretion of the author;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Created only for the author's personal convenience;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Not the result of official direction or encouragement, whether oral or written; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Not shown to other persons for any reason or filed in agency files.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(11) Relationship between the Privacy Act and FOIA. In some instances, individuals requesting access to records
pertaining to themselves may not know which Act to cite as the appropriate statutory authority. The following guidelines
are to ensure that the individuals receive the greatest degree of access under both Acts: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Access requests that specifically state or reasonably imply that they are made under 5 U.S.C. 552 (1988) as amended
by the Freedom of Information Reform Act of 1986, are processed under Secretary of the Navy Instruction 5720.42E,
``Department of the Navy Freedom of Information Act Program.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Access requests that specifically state or reasonably imply that they are made under 5 U.S.C. 552a are processed
under this subpart and subpart G of this part.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Access requests that cite both 5 U.S.C. 552a, as amended by the Computer Matching Act of 1988 and 5 U.S.C. 552 (1988)
as amended by the Freedom of Information Reform Act are processed under the Act that provides the greater degree of
access. Inform the requester which instruction was used in granting or denying access.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Do not penalize the individual access to his or her records otherwise releasable under 5 U.S.C. 552a and periodic
Chief of Naval Operations Notes (OPNAVNOTEs) 5211, ``Current Privacy Act Issuances'', simply because he or she failed
to cite the appropriate statute or instruction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(12) Time Limits. Acknowledge requests for access made under Privacy Act or this subpart and subpart G of this part
within 10 working days after receipt, and advise the requester of your decision to grant/deny access within 30 working
days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reproduction fees. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Normally, only one copy of any record or document will be provided. Checks or money orders for fees should be made payable
to the Treasurer of the United States and deposited to the miscellaneous receipts of the treasury account maintained
at the finance office servicing the activity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Fee schedules shall include only the direct cost of reproduction and shall not include costs of: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Time or effort devoted to searching for or reviewing the record by naval personnel; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Fees not associated with the actual cost of reproduction;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Producing a copy when it must be provided to the individual without cost under another regulation, directive,
or law; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Normal postage; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Transportation of records or personnel; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Producing a copy when the individual has requested only to review the record and has not requested a copy to keep,
and the only means of allowing review is to make a copy (e.g., the record is stored in a computer and a copy must be printed
to provide individual access, or the naval activity does not wish to surrender temporarily the original record for
the individual to review).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Fee schedules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Office copy (per page)............$.10
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Microfiche (per fiche)............$.25
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Fee waivers. Waive fees automatically if the direct cost of reproduction is less than $15, unless the individual
is seeking an obvious extension or duplication of a previous request for which he or she was granted a waiver. Decisions
to waive or reduce fees that exceed $15 are made on a case-by-case basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Denying individual access.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Deny the record subject access to requested record only if it was compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil
action or proceeding or is in a system of records that has been exempt from the access provisions of &sect;701.113.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Deny the individual access only to those portions of the record for which the denial will serve a legitimate government
purpose. An individual may be refused access for failure to comply with established procedural requirements, but
must be told the specific reason for the refusal and the proper access procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Deny the individual access to his or her medical and psychological records if it is determined that access could
have an adverse affect on the mental or physical health of the individual. This determination normally should be made
in consultation with a medical practitioner. If it is medically indicated that access could have an adverse mental
or physical effect on the individual, provide the record to a medical practitioner named by the individual, along
with an explanation of why access without medical supervision could be harmful to the individual. In any case, do not
require the named medical practitioner to request the record for the individual. If, however, the individual refuses
or fails to designate a medical practitioner, access shall be refused. The refusal is not considered a denial for reporting
purposes under the Privacy Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notifying the individual. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Written denial of access must be given to the individual. The denial letter shall include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The name, title, and signature of a designated denial authority;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The date of the denial; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The specific reason for the denial, citing the appropriate subsections of 5 U.S.C. 552a or this subpart and subpart
G of this part authorizing the denial; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The individual's right to appeal the denial within 60 calendar days of the date the notice is mailed; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The title and address of the review authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Individual review and amendment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Encourage individuals to review periodically, the information maintained about them in systems of records, and
to avail themselves of the amendment procedures established by this subpart and subpart G of this part.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Right to amend. An individual may request to amend any record retrieved by his or her personal identifier from a
system of records, unless the system has been exempt from the amendment procedures under this subpart. Amendments
under this subpart and subpart G of this part are limited to correcting factual matters, not matters of opinion (i.e.,
information contained in evaluations of promotion potential or performance appraisals). When records sought to
be amended are covered by another issuance, the administrative procedures under that issuance must be exhausted
before using the Privacy Act. In other words, the Privacy Act may not be used to avoid the administrative procedures
required by the issuance actually covering the records in question.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In writing. Amendment requests shall be in writing, except for routine administrative changes, such as change
of address.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Content of amendment request. An amendment request must include a description of the information to be amended;
the reason for the amendment; the type of amendment action sought (i.e., deletion, correction, or addition); and
copies of available documentary evidence supporting the request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Burden of proof. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The individual must provide adequate support for the request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Verifying identity. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The individual may be required to provide identification to prevent the inadvertent or intentional amendment of
another's record. Use the verification guidelines provided in &sect;701.109(a)(4).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Limits on amending judicial and quasi-judicial evidence and findings. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This subpart and subpart G of this part do not permit the alteration of evidence presented in the course of judicial
or quasi-judicial proceedings. Amendments to such records must be made in accordance with procedures established
for such proceedings. This subpart and subpart G of this part do not permit a collateral attack on a judicial or quasi-judicial
finding; however, this subpart and subpart G of this part may be used to challenge the accuracy of recording the finding
in a system of records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Standards for amendment request determinations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The record which the individual requests to be amended must meet the recordkeeping standards established in &sect;701.105.
The record must be accurate, relevant, timely, complete, and necessary. If the record in its present state does not
meet each of the criteria, grant the amendment request to the extent necessary to meet them.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Time limits. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Within 10 working days of receiving an amendment request, the systems manager shall provide the individual a written
acknowledgement of the request. If action on the amendment request is completed within the 10 working days and the
individual is so informed, no separate acknowledgment is necessary. The acknowledgment must clearly identify the
request and advise the individual when to expect notification of the completed action. Only under exceptional circumstances
should more than 30 working days be required to complete the action on an amendment request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Granting an amendment request in whole or in part.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Notify the requester. To the extent the amendment request is granted, the systems manager shall notify the individual
and make the appropriate amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Notify previous recipients. Notify all previous recipients of the information (as reflected in the disclosure
accounting record) that the amendment has been made and provide each a copy of the amended record. Recipients who are
known to be no longer retaining the record need not be advised of the amendment. If it is known that other naval activities,
DoD components, or Federal agencies have been provided the information that now requires amendment, or if the individual
requests that these agencies be notified, provide the notification of amendment even if those activities or agencies
are not listed on the disclosure accounting form.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Denying an amendment request in whole or in part. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the amendment request is denied in whole or in part, promptly notify the individual in writing. Include in the notification
to the individual the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Those sections of 5 U.S.C. 552a or this subpart and subpart G of this part upon which the denial is based; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) His or her right to appeal to the head of the activity for an independent review of the initial denial; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The procedures for requesting an appeal, including the title and address of the official to whom the appeal should
be sent; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Where the individual can receive assistance in filing the appeal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Requests for amending OPM records. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The records in an OPM government-wide system of records are only temporarily in the custody of naval activities. Requests
for amendment of these records must be processed in accordance with OPM Regulations and the Federal Personnel Manual.
The denial authority may deny a request, but all denials are subject to review by the Assistant Director for Workforce
Information, Personnel Systems Oversight Group, Office of Personnel Management, 1900 E Street, NW, Washington,
DC 20415.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Individual's statement of disagreement.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) If the review authority refuses to amend the record as requested, the individual may submit a concise statement
of disagreement listing the reasons for disagreeing with the refusal to amend.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If possible, incorporate the statement of disagreement into the record. If that is not possible, annotate the
record to reflect that the statement was filed and maintain the statement so that it can be readily obtained when the
disputed information is used or disclosed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Furnish copies of the statement of disagreement to all individuals listed on the disclosure accounting form (except
those known to be no longer retaining the record), as well as to all other known holders of copies of the record.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Whenever the disputed information is disclosed for any purpose, ensure that the statement of disagreement also
is used or disclosed.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Conditions of disclosure.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) 5 U.S.C. 552a prohibits an agency from disclosing any record contained in a system of records to any person or agency,
except when the record subject gives written consent for the disclosure or when one of the 12 conditions listed below
in this subsection applies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Except for disclosures made under 5 U.S.C. 552 (1988) as amended by the Freedom of Information Reform Act of 1986
and Secretary of the Navy Instruction 5720.42E, ``Department of the Navy Freedom of Information Act Program,'' before
disclosing any record from a system of records to any recipient other than a Federal agency, make reasonable efforts
to ensure the record is accurate, relevant, timely, and complete for Department of the Navy purposes. Records discovered
to have been improperly filed in the system of records should be removed before disclosure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If validation cannot be obtained from the record itself, the naval activity may contact the record subject (if
reasonably available) to verify the accuracy, timeliness, completeness, and relevancy of the information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If validation cannot be obtained from the record and the record subject is not reasonably available, advise the
recipient that the information is believed to be valid as of a specific date and reveal any factors bearing on the validity
of the information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Nonconsensual disclosures. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5 U.S.C. 552a provides 12 instances when a record in a system of records may be disclosed without the written consent
of the record subject:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Disclosures within the Department of Defense. For purposes of disclosing records, the Department of Defense
is considered a single agency; hence, a record may be disclosed to any officer or employee in the Department of Defense
(including private contractor personnel who are engaged to perform services needed in connection with the operation
of a system of records for a DoD component), who have a need for the record in the performance of their duties, provided
this use is compatible with the purpose for which the record is maintained. This provision is based on the ``need to
know'' concept.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) For example, this may include disclosure to personnel managers, review boards, discipline officers, courts-martial
personnel, medical officers, investigating officers, and representatives of the Judge Advocate General, Auditor
General, Naval Inspector General, or the Naval Investigative Service, who require the information in order to discharge
their official duties. Examples of personnel outside the Department of the Navy who may be included are: Personnel
of the Joint Staff, Armed Forces Entrance and Examining Stations, Defense Investigative Service, or the other military
departments, who require the information in order to discharge an official duty.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) It may also include the transfer of records between naval components and non-DoD agencies in connection with
the Personnel Exchange Program (PEP) and interagency support agreements. Disclosure accountings are not required
for intra-agency disclosure and disclosures made in connection with interagency support agreements or the PEP.
Although some disclosures authorized by this paragraph might also meet the criteria for disclosure under other exceptions
specified in the following paragraphs of this section, they should be treated under this paragraph for disclosure
accounting purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Disclosures required by the FOIA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A record must be disclosed if required by 5 U.S.C. 552 (1988) as amended by the Freedom of Information Reform Act
of 1986, which is implemented by Secretary of the Navy Instruction 5720.42E, ``Department of the Navy Freedom of Information
Act Program.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 5 U.S.C. 552 (1988) as amended by the Freedom of Information Reform Act of 1986 and Secretary of the Navy Instruction
5720.42E, ``Department of the Navy Freedom of Information Act Program'' require that records be made available to
any person requesting them in writing, unless the record is exempt from disclosure under one of the nine FOIA exemptions.
Therefore, if a record is not exempt from disclosure, it must be provided to the requester.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Certain records, such as personnel, medical, and similar files, are exempt from disclosure under exemption
(b)(6) of 5 U.S.C. 552 (1988) as amended by the Freedom of Information Act Reform Act of 1986. Under that exemption,
disclosure of information pertaining to an individual can be denied only when the disclosure would be a clearly unwarranted
invasion of personal privacy. The first step is to determine whether a viable personal privacy interest exists in
these records involving an identifiable living person. The second step is to consider how disclosure would benefit
the general public in light of the content and context of the information in question. The third step is to determine
whether the identified public interests qualify for consideration. The fourth step is to balance the personal privacy
interests against the qualifying public interest. Numerous factors must be considered such as: The nature of the
information to be disclosed (i.e., Do individuals normally have an expectation of privacy in the type of information
to be disclosed?); importance of the public interest served by the disclosure and probability of further disclosure
which may result in an unwarranted invasion of privacy; relationship of the requester to the public interest being
served; newsworthiness of the individual to whom the information pertains (i.e., high ranking officer, public figure);
degree of sensitivity of the information from the standpoint of the individual or the individual's family, and its
potential for being misused to the harm, embarrassment, or inconvenience of the individual or the individual's family;
the passage of time since the event which is the topic of the record (i.e., to disclose that an individual has been arrested
and is being held for trial by court-martial is normally permitted, while to disclose an arrest which did not result
in conviction might not be permitted after the passage of time); and the degree to which the information is already
in the public domain or is already known by the particular requester.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Records or information from investigatory records, including personnel security investigatory records,
are exempt from disclosure under the broader standard of ``an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy'' found in
exemption (b)(7)(C) of 5 U.S.C. 552. This broader standard applies only to records or information compiled for law
enforcement purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) A disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552 about military members must be in accordance with Secretary of the Navy Instruction
5720.42E, ``Department of the Navy Freedom of Information Act Program'', but the following information normally
may be disclosed from military personnel records (except for those personnel assigned to sensitive or routinely
deployable units, or located in a foreign territory), without a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy:
Full name, rank, date of rank, base pay, past duty stations, present duty station and future duty station (if finalized),
unless the stations have been determined by the Department of the Navy to be sensitive, routinely deployable, or located
in a foreign territory, office or duty telephone number, source of commission, promotion sequence number, awards
and decorations, attendance at professional military schools, and duty status at any given time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) The following information normally may be disclosed from civilian employee records about CONUS employees:
Full name, present and past position titles and occupational series, present and past grades, present and past annual
salary rates (including performance awards or bonuses, incentive awards, merit pay amount, Meritorious and Distinguished
Executive Ranks, and allowances and differentials), past duty stations, present duty station and future duty station
(if finalized), including room numbers, shop designations, or other identifying information regarding buildings
or places of employment, unless the duty stations have been determined by the Department of the Navy to be sensitive,
routinely deployable, or located in a foreign territory, position descriptions, identification of job elements,
and those performance standards (but not actual performance appraisals) that the disclosure of which would not interfere
with law enforcement programs or severely inhibit Department of the Navy effectiveness.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) Disclosure of home addresses and home telephone numbers normally is considered a clearly unwarranted invasion
of personal privacy and is prohibited. However, they may be disclosed if the individual has consented to the disclosure;
the disclosure is required by the FOIA; the disclosure is required by another law, such as 42 U.S.C. 653, which provides
assistance to states in locating parents who have defaulted on child support payments, or the collection of alimony,
and to state and local tax authorities for the purpose of enforcing tax laws. However, care must be taken prior to release
to ensure that a written record is prepared to document the reasons for the release determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) When compiling home addresses and telephone numbers, the individual may be offered the option of authorizing
disclosure of the information without further consent for specific purposes, such as locator services. In that case,
the information may be disclosed for the stated purpose without further consent. If the information is to be disclosed
for any other purpose, a signed consent permitting the additional disclosure must be obtained from the individual.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Before listing home addresses and telephone numbers in Department of the Navy telephone directories, give the
individual the opportunity to refuse such a listing. If the individual requests that the home address or telephone
number not be listed in the directory, do not assess any additional fee associated with maintaining an unlisted number
for government-owned telephone services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The sale or rental of lists of names and addresses is prohibited unless such action is specifically authorized
by Federal law. This does not prohibit the disclosure of names and addresses made under Secretary of the Navy Instruction
5720.42E, ``Department of the Navy Freedom of Information Act Program.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) In response to FOIA requests, information concerning special and general courts-martial results (e.g., records
of trial) are releasable. However, information regarding summary courts-martial and non-judicial punishment
are generally not releasable. The balancing of interests must be done. It is possible that in a particular case, information
regarding non-judicial punishment should be disclosed pursuant to a FOIA request (i.e., the facts leading to a nonjudicial
punishment are particularly newsworthy or the case involves a senior official abusing the public trust through office-related
misconduct, such as embezzlement). Announcement of nonjudicial punishment dispositions under JAGMAN, subsection
0107, is a proper exercise of command authority and not a release of information under FOIA or this subpart and subpart
G of this part. Exceptions to this policy must be coordinated with CNO (N09B30) or CMC (MI&hyph;3) prior to responding
to requesters, including all requests for this type of information from members of Congress.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Disclosures for established routine uses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Records may be disclosed outside the Department of the Navy if the disclosure is for an established routine use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A routine use shall:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Be compatible with and related to the purpose for which the record was created;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Identify the persons or organizations to whom the record may be disclosed;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Identify specifically the uses for which the information may be employed by the receiving person or organization;
and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Have been published previously in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A routine use shall be established for each user of the information outside the Department of the Navy who needs
the information for an official purpose.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Routine uses may be established, discontinued, or amended without the consent of the individuals to whom the
records pertain. However, new and amended routine uses must be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at least 30 days before the information may be disclosed under their provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) In addition to the routine uses established by the Department of the Navy for each system of records, common ``Blanket
Routine Uses,'' applicable to all record systems maintained with the Department of the Navy, have been established.
These ``Blanket Routine Uses'' are published at the beginning of the Department of the Navy's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 compilation of record systems notices rather than at each system notice and are also reflected in periodic Chief of
Naval Operations Notes (OPNAVNOTEs) 5211, ``Current Privacy Act Issuances.'' Unless a system notice specifically
excludes a system of records from a ``Blanket Routine Use,'' all ``Blanket Routine Uses'' apply to that system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) If the recipient has not been identified in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or if the recipient, though identified, intends to employ the information for a purpose not published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the written consent of the individual is required before the disclosure can be made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Disclosures to the Bureau of the Census. Records may be disclosed to the Bureau of the Census for purposes of planning
or carrying out a census, survey, or related activities authorized by 13 U.S.C. 8.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Disclosures for statistical research or reporting. Records may be disclosed to a recipient for statistical research
or reporting if:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Prior to the disclosure, the recipient has provided adequate written assurance that the records shall be used
solely for statistical research or reporting; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The records are transferred in a form that does not identify individuals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Disclosures to the National Archives and Records Administration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Records may be disclosed to the National Archives and Records Administration for evaluation to determine whether
the records have sufficient historical or other value to warrant preservation by the Federal government. If preservation
is warranted, the records will be retained by the National Archives and Record Administration, which becomes the
official owner of the records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Records may be disclosed to the National Archives and Records Administration to carry out records management
inspections required by Federal law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Records transferred to a Federal Records Center operated by the National Archives and Records Administration
for storage are not within this category. Those records continue to be maintained and controlled by the transferring
naval activity. The Federal Records Center is considered the agent of Department of the Navy and the disclosure is
made under &sect;701.112(b)(1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Disclosures when requested for law enforcement purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A record may be disclosed to another agency or an instrumentality of any governmental jurisdiction within or under
the control of the U.S. for a civil or criminal law enforcement activity if:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The civil or criminal law enforcement activity is authorized by law (federal, state or local); and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The head of the agency (or his or her designee) has made a written request to the naval activity specifying the particular
record or portion desired and the law enforcement purpose for which it is sought.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Blanket requests for any and all records pertaining to an individual shall not be honored. The requesting agency
must specify each record or portion desired and how each relates to the authorized law enforcement activity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If a naval activity discloses a record outside the Department of Defense for law enforcement purposes without
the individual's consent and without an adequate written request, the disclosure must be under an established routine
use, such as the ``Blanket Routine Use'' for law enforcement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Disclosure to foreign law enforcement agencies is not governed by the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a and this paragraph,
but may be made only under established ``Blanket Routine Uses,'' routine uses published in the individual record
system notice, or to other governing authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Disclosure to protect the health or safety of an individual. Disclosure may be made under emergency conditions
involving circumstances affecting the health and safety of an individual (i.e., when the time required to obtain
the consent of the individual to whom the records pertain might result in a delay which could impair the health or safety
of a person) provided notification of the disclosure is sent to the record subject. Sending the notification to the
last known address is sufficient. In instances where information is requested by telephone, an attempt will be made
to verify the inquirer's and medical facility's identities and the caller's telephone number. The requested information,
if then considered appropriate and of an emergency nature, may be provided by return call.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Disclosures to Congress.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A record may be disclosed to either House of Congress at the request of either the Senate or House of Representatives
as a whole. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A record also may be disclosed to any committee, subcommittee, or joint committee of Congress if the disclosure
pertains to a matter within the legislative or investigative jurisdiction of the committee, subcommittee, or joint
committee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Disclosure may not be made to a Member of Congress requesting in his or her individual capacity. However, for
Members of Congress making inquiries on behalf of individuals who are subjects of records, a ``Blanket Routine Use''
has been established to permit disclosures to individual Members of Congress.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) When responding to a congressional inquiry made on behalf of a constituent by whose identifier the record is retrieved,
there is no need to verify that the individual has authorized the disclosure to the Member of Congress.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The oral or written statement of a Congressional staff member is sufficient to establish that a request has been
received from the individual to whom the record pertains.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) If the constituent inquiry is made on behalf of an individual other than the record subject, provide the Member
of Congress only that information releasable under 5 U.S.C. 552. Advise the Member of Congress that the written consent
of the record subject is required before additional information may be disclosed. Do not contact the record subject
to obtain consent for the disclosure to the Member of Congress unless the Congressional office specifically requests
it be done.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) Disclosures to the Comptroller General for the General Accounting Office (GAO). Records may be disclosed to
the Comptroller General of the U.S., or authorized representative, in the course of the performance of the duties
of the GAO.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(11) Disclosures under court orders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Records may be disclosed under the order of a court of competent jurisdiction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) When a record is disclosed under this provision and the compulsory legal process becomes a matter of public record,
make reasonable efforts to notify the individual to whom the record pertains. Notification sent to the last known
address of the individual is sufficient. If the order has not yet become a matter of public record, seek to be advised
as to when it will become public. Neither the identity or the party to whom the disclosure was made nor the purpose of
the disclosure shall be made available to the record subject unless the court order has become a matter of public record.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The court order must bear the signature of a federal, state, or local judge. Orders signed by court clerks or attorneys
are not deemed to be orders of a court of competent jurisdiction. A photocopy of the order, regular on its face, will
be sufficient evidence of the court's exercise of its authority of the minimal requirements of SECNAVINST 5820.8A

(12) Disclosures to consumer reporting agencies. Certain information may be disclosed to consumer reporting agencies
(i.e., credit reference companies such as TRW and Equifax, etc.) as defined by the Federal Claims Collection Act of
1966 (31 U.S.C. 952d). Under the provisions of that Act, the following information may be disclosed to a consumer reporting
agency: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Name, address, taxpayer identification number (SSN), and other information necessary to establish the identity
of the individual;

Disclosures to commercial enterprises. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Records may be disclosed to commercial enterprises only under the criteria established by Secretary of the Navy Instruction
5720.42E and 42 U.S.C. 653, Parent Locator Service for Enforcement of Child Support.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Any information required to be disclosed by Secretary of the Navy Instruction 5720.42E and 42 U.S.C. 653, Parent
Locator Service for Enforcement of Child Support may be disclosed to a requesting commercial enterprise.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Commercial enterprises may present a consent statement signed by the individual indicating specific conditions
for disclosing information from a record. Statements such as the following, if signed by the individual, are considered
sufficient to authorize the disclosure: I hereby authorize the Department of the Navy to verify my SSN or other identifying
information and to disclose my home address and telephone number to authorized representatives of (name of commercial
enterprise) to be used in connection with my commercial dealings with that enterprise. All information furnished
will be used in connection with my financial relationship with (name of commercial enterprise).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) When a consent statement as described in the preceding subsection is presented, provide the information to the
commercial enterprise, unless the disclosure is prohibited by another regulation or Federal law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Blanket consent statements that do not identify the Department of Defense or Department of the Navy, or that do
not specify exactly the information to be disclosed, may be honored if it is clear that the individual, in signing the
consent statement, was seeking a personal benefit (i.e., loan for a house or automobile) and was aware of the type of
information necessary to obtain the benefit sought.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Do not honor requests from commercial enterprises for official evaluations of personal characteristics such
as personal financial habits.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Disclosures without the individual's consent. Normally, the following information may be disclosed without
the individual's consent:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Information required to be released by Secretary of the Navy Instruction 5720.42E and OPM Regulations and the
Federal Personnel Manual, as well as the information listed in &sect;701.112(b)(2)(v) for military personnel and

Disclosure Accounting. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Keep an accurate record of all disclosures made from a record (including those made with the consent of the individual)
except those made to DoD personnel for use in performing their official duties; and those made under the FOIA. Disclosure
accounting is to permit the individual to determine what agencies or persons have been provided information from
the record, enable Department of the Navy activities to advise prior recipients of the record of any subsequent amendments
or statements of dispute concerning the record, and provide an audit trial of Department of the Navy's compliance
with 5 U.S.C. 552a.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Disclosure accountings shall contain the date of the disclosure; a description of the information disclosed;
the purpose of the disclosure; and the name and address of the person or agency to whom the disclosure was made.

(2) The record subject has the right of access to the disclosure accounting except when the disclosure was made at the
request of a civil or criminal law enforcement agency under &sect;701.112(b)(7); or when the system of records has
been exempted from the requirement to provide access to the disclosure accounting.

Methods of disclosure accounting. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the characteristics of various records maintained within the Department of the Navy vary widely, no uniform
method for keeping disclosure accountings is prescribed. The primary criteria are that the selected method be one
which will:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Enable an individual to ascertain what persons or agencies have received disclosures pertaining to him/her;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Provide a basis for informing recipients of subsequent amendments or statements of dispute concerning the record;
and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Provide a means to prove, if necessary that the activity has complied with the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a and
this subpart and subpart G of this part.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Retention of Disclosure Accounting. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Maintain a disclosure accounting of the life of the record to which the disclosure pertains, or 5 years after the date
of the disclosure, whichever is longer. Disclosure accounting records are normally maintained with the record,
as this will ensure compliance with &sect;701.112(f).

No system of records is automatically exempt from all provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a. A system of records is exempt from
only those provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a that are identified specifically in the exemption rule for the system. Subpart
G of this part contains the systems designated as exempt, the types of exemptions claimed, the authority and reasons
for invoking the exemptions and the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a from which each system has been exempt. Exemptions
are discretionary on the part of Department of the Navy and are not effective until published as a final rule in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

exemption may be established and then propose an exemption rule for the system. Submit the proposal to CNO (N09B30)
for approval and publication in the

There are two types of exemptions permitted by 5 U.S.C. 552a.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General exemptions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Those that authorize the exemption of a system of records from all but specifically identified provisions of 5 U.S.C.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Specific exemptions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Those that allow a system of records to be exempt from only a few designated provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Establishing exemptions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) 5 U.S.C. 552a authorizes the Secretary of the Navy to adopt rules designating eligible systems of records as exempt
from certain requirements. The Secretary of the Navy has delegated the CNO (N09B30) to make a determination that the
system is one for which an exemption may be established and then propose and establish an exemption rule for the system.
No system of records within Department of the Navy shall be considered exempt until the CNO (N09B30) has approved the
exemption and an exemption rule has been published as a final rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A system of records is exempt from only those provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a that are identified specifically in the Department
of the Navy exemption rule for the system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) No exemption may be established for a system of records until the system itself has been established by publishing
a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, at least 30 days prior to the effective date, describing the system. This allows interested persons an opportunity
to comment. An exemption may not be used to deny an individual access to information that he or she can obtain under Secretary
of the Navy Instruction 5720.42E, ``Department of the Navy Freedom of Information Act Program.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Exemption for classified material. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All systems of records maintained by the Department of the Navy shall be exempt under section (k)(1) of 5 U.S.C. 552a,
to the extent that the systems contains any information properly classified under E.O. 12356 and that is required
by that E.O. to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy. This exemption is applicable to
parts of all systems of records including those not otherwise specifically designated for exemptions herein which
contain isolated items of properly classified information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Note: Department of the Navy Privacy Act systems of records which contain classified information automatically
qualify for a (k)(1) exemption, without establishing an exemption rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Exempt records in nonexempt systems.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) An exemption rule applies to the system of records for which it was established. If a record from an exempt system
is incorporated intentionally into a system that has not been exempt, the published notice and rules for the nonexempt
system will apply to the record and it will not be exempt from any provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A record from one component's (i.e., Department of the Navy) exempted system that is temporarily in the possession
of another component (i.e., Army) remains subject to the published system notice and rules of the originating component's
(i.e., Department of the Navy). However, if the non-originating component incorporates the record into its own system
of records, the published notice and rules for the system into which it is incorporated shall apply. If that system
of records has not been exempted, the record shall not be exempt from any provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A record accidentally misfiled into a system of records is governed by the published notice and rules for the system
of records in which it actually should have been filed.

Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of the Navy is not authorized to establish an exemption for records maintained by the CIA under subsection
(j)(1) of 5 U.S.C. 552a.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Law enforcement.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) The general exemption provided by subsection (j)(2) of 5 U.S.C. 552a may be established to protect criminal law
enforcement records maintained by Department of the Navy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) To be eligible for the (j)(2) exemption, the system of records must be maintained by an element that performs,
as one of its principal functions, the enforcement of criminal laws. The Naval Investigative Service, Naval Inspector
General, and military police activities qualify for this exemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Criminal law enforcement includes police efforts to detect, prevent, control, or reduce crime, or to apprehend
criminals, and the activities of prosecution, court, correctional, probation, pardon, or parole authorities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Information that may be protected under the (j)(2) exemption includes:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Information compiled for the purpose of identifying criminal offenders and alleged criminal offenders consisting
of only identifying data and notations of arrests; the nature and disposition of criminal charges; and sentencing,
confinement, release, parole, and probation status;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Information compiled for the purpose of a criminal investigation, including reports of informants and investigators,
and associated with an identifiable individual; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Reports identifiable to an individual, compiled at any stage of the enforcement process, from arrest, apprehension,
indictment, or preferral of charges through final release from the supervision that resulted from the commission
of a crime.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The (j)(2) exemption does not apply to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Investigative records maintained by a naval activity having no criminal law enforcement duties as one of its principle
functions, or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Investigative records compiled by any element concerning individual's suitability, eligibility, or qualification
for duty, employment, or access to classified information, regardless of the principle functions of the naval activity
that compiled them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) The (j)(2) exemption established for a system of records maintained by a criminal law enforcement activity cannot
protect law enforcement records incorporated into a nonexempt system of records or any system of records maintained
by an activity not principally tasked with enforcing criminal laws. All system managers, therefore, are cautioned
to comply strictly with Department of the Navy regulations or instructions prohibiting or limiting the incorporation
of criminal law enforcement records into systems other than those maintained by criminal law enforcement activities.

Specific exemptions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Specific exemptions permit certain categories of records to be exempted from specific provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a.
Subsections (k)(1)-(7) of 5 U.S.C. 552a allow exemptions for seven categories of records. To be eligible for a specific
exemption, the record must meet the corresponding criteria. Note: Department of the Navy Privacy Act systems of records
which contain classified information automatically qualify for a (k)(1) exemption, without an established exemption
rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) (k)(1) exemption: Information properly classified under Secretary of the Navy Instruction 5720.42E, ``Department
of the Navy Freedom of Information Act Program'' and E.O. 12356, in the interest of national defense or foreign policy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) (k)(2) exemption: Investigatory information (other than that information within the scope of &sect;701.113(f)(2)
compiled for law enforcement purposes. If maintaining the information causes an individual to be ineligible for
or denied any right, benefit, or privilege that he or she would otherwise be eligible for or entitled to under Federal
law, then he or she shall be given access to the information, except for the information that would identify a confidential
source (see &sect; 701.113(h), ``confidential source''). The (k)(2) exemption, when established, allows limited
protection on investigative records maintained for use in personnel and administrative actions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) (k)(3) exemption: Records maintained in connection with providing protective services to the President of the
United States and other individuals under 18 U.S.C. 3056.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) (k)(4) exemption: Records required by Federal law to be maintained and used solely as statistical records that
are not used to make any determination about an identifiable individual, except as provided by 13 U.S.C. 8.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) (k)(5) exemption: Investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility,
or qualifications for Federal civilian employment, military service, Federal contracts, or access to classified
information, but only to the extent such material would reveal the identity of a confidential source. (See &sect;701.113(h),
``confidential source''). This exemption allows protection of confidential sources in background investigations,
employment inquiries, and similar inquiries used in personnel screening to determine suitability, eligibility,
or qualifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) (k)(6) exemption: Testing or examination material used solely to determine individual qualifications for appointment
or promotion in the Federal or military service if the disclosure would compromise the objectivity or fairness of
the testing or examination process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) (k)(7) exemption: Evaluation material used to determine potential for promotion in the military services, but
only to the extent that disclosure would reveal the identity of a confidential source. (See &sect;701.113(h), ``confidential
source''.)

(2) Denial of access. The activity wrongfully refuses to allow the individual to review the record or wrongfully denies
his or her request for a copy of the record;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Failure to meet recordkeeping standards. The activity fails to maintain an individual's record with the accuracy,
relevance, timeliness, and completeness necessary to assure fairness in any determination about the individual's
rights, benefits, or privileges and, in fact, makes an adverse determination based on the record; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Failure to comply with Privacy Act. The activity fails to comply with any other provision of 5 U.S.C. 552a or any
rule or regulation promulgated under 5 U.S.C. 552a and thereby causes the individual to be adversely affected.

5 U.S.C. 552a and this subpart and subpart G of this part are applicable to certain types of computer matching, i.e.,
the computer comparison of automated systems of records.  There are two specific kinds of matching programs that are
fully governed by 5 U.S.C. 552a and this subpart and subpart G of this part: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Matches using records from Federal personnel or payroll systems of records;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Matches involving Federal benefit programs to accomplish one or more of the following purposes:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) To determine eligibility for a Federal benefit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) To comply with benefit program requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) To effect recovery of improper payments or delinquent debts from current or former beneficiaries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The record comparison must be a computerized one. Manual comparisons are not covered, involving records from
two or more automated systems of records (i.e., systems of records maintained by Federal agencies that are subject
to 5 U.S.C. 552a); or a Department of the Navy automated systems of records and automated records maintained by a non-Federal
agency (i.e., State or local government or agent thereof). A covered computer matching program entails not only the
actual computerized comparison, but also preparing and executing a written agreement between the participants,
securing approval of the Defense Data Integrity Board, publishing a matching notice in the

Granting individuals access to portions of these records pertaining to or consisting of, but not limited to, disciplinary
reports, criminal investigations, and related statements of witnesses, and such other related matter in conjunction
with the enforcement of criminal laws, could interfere with the orderly investigations, with the orderly administration
of justice, and possibly enable suspects to avoid detection or apprehension. Disclosure of this information could
result in the concealment, destruction, or fabrication of evidence, and jeopardize the safety and well-being of
informants, witnesses and their families, and law enforcement personnel and their families. Disclosure of this

Exemption is needed in order to encourage persons having knowledge of abusive or neglectful acts toward children
to report such information, and to protect such sources from embarrassment or recrimination, as well as to protect
their right to privacy. It is essential that the identities of all individuals who furnish information under an express
promise of confidentiality be protected. Additionally, granting individuals access to information relating to
criminal and civil law enforcement, as well as the release of certain disclosure accountings, could interfere with
ongoing investigations and the orderly administration of justice, in that it could result in the concealment, alteration,
destruction, or fabrication of information; could hamper the identification of offenders and the disposition of
charges; and could jeopardize the safety and well being of parents and their children.

The release of disclosure accountings would permit the subject of an investigation to obtain valuable information
concerning the nature of that investigation, and the information contained, or the identity of witnesses or informants,
would therefor present a serious impediment to law enforcement. In addition, disclosure of the accounting would
amount to notice to the individual of the existence of a record. Access to the records contained in this system would
inform the subject of the existence of material compiled for law enforcement purposes, the premature release of which
could prevent the successful completion of investigation, and lead to the improper influencing of witnesses, the
destruction of records, or the fabrication of testimony. Exempt portions of this system also contain information
that has been properly classified under E.O. 12356, and that is required to be kept secret in the interest of national
defense or foreign policy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exempt portions of this system also contain information considered relevant and necessary to make a determination

the privacy and physical safety of witnesses and informants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This system of records is exempted from procedures for notice to an individual as to the existence of records pertaining
to him/her dealing with an actual or potential civil or regulatory investigation, because such notice to an individual
would be detrimental to the successful conduct and/or completion of an investigation, pending or future. Mere notice
of the fact of an investigation could inform the subject or others that their activities are under, or may become the
subject of, an investigation. This could enable the subjects to avoid detection, to influence witnesses improperly,
to destroy records, or to fabricate testimony.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exempt portions of this system containing screening board reports. Screening board reports set forth the results
of oral examination of applicants for a position as a special agent with the Naval Investigation Service Command.
Disclosure of these records would reveal the areas pursued in the course of the examination and thus adversely affect
the result of the selection process. Equally important, the records contain the candid views of the members composing
the board. Release of the records could affect the willingness of the members to provide candid opinions and thus diminish
the effectiveness of a program which is essential to maintaining the high standard of the Special Agent Corps., i.e.,
those records constituting examination material used solely to determine individual qualifications for appointment
in the Federal service.

Granting individuals access to information collected and maintained by this component relating to the enforcement
of criminal laws could interfere with orderly administration of justice, and possibly enable suspects to avoid detection
or apprehension. Disclosure of this information could result in concealment, destruction, or fabrication of evidence,
and jeopardize the safety and well being of informants, witnesses and their families, and of law enforcement personnel
and their families. Disclosure of this information could also reveal and render ineffectual investigative techniques,
sources, and methods used by this component, and could result in the invasion of privacy of individuals only incidentally
related to an investigation.The exemption of the individual's right of access to his or her records, and the reason
therefore, necessitate the exemption of this system of records from the requirements of other cited provisions.

Subsection (d) because granting individuals access to information relating to the preparation and conduct of litigation
would impair the development and implementation of legal strategy. Accordingly, such records are exempt under the
attorney-client privilege. Disclosure might also compromise on-going investigations and reveal confidential
informants. Additionally, granting access to the record subject would seriously impair the Navy's ability to negotiate
settlements or pursue other civil remedies. Amendment is inappropriate because the litigation files contain official
records including transcripts, court orders, investigatory materials, evidentiary materials such as exhibits,
decisional memorandum and other case-related papers. Administrative due process could not be achieved by the ``exparte''
correction of such materials.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsection (e)(1) because it is not possible in all instances to determine relevancy or necessity of specific information
in the early stages of case development. What appeared relevant and necessary when collected, ultimately may be deemed
unnecessary upon assessment in the context of devising legal strategy. Information collected during civil litigation
investigations which is not used during subject case is often retained to provide leads in other cases or to establish
patterns of activity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsection (f)(2), (3), and (4) because this record system is exempt from the individual access provisions of subsection
(d).

Exemption is needed in order to encourage persons having knowledge of abusive or neglectful acts toward children
to report such information, and to protect such sources from embarrassment or recriminations, as well as to protect
their right to privacy. It is essential that the identities of all individuals who furnish information under an express
promise of confidentiality be protected. Additionally, granting individuals access to information relating to
criminal and civil law enforcement, as well as the release of certain disclosure accounting, could interfere with
ongoing investigations and the orderly administration of justice, in that it could result in the concealment, alteration,
destruction, or fabrication of information; could hamper the identification of offenders or alleged offenders
and the disposition of charges; and could jeopardize the safety and well being of parents and their children.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On August 18, 1994, (59 FR 42506) the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) approved a revision to
the Indiana State Implementation Plan (SIP) for the Employee Commute Options (ECO) program without prior proposal.
The rule approved an ECO program for the severe ozone nonattainment area that includes Lake and Porter Counties. The
USEPA is removing this final rule due to the adverse comments received on this rule. In a subsequent final rule, USEPA
will summarize and respond to the comments received and announce final rulemaking action on this requested Indiana
SIP revision on ECO.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The State of Louisiana has applied for Final Authorization for revisions to its hazardous waste program under the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reviewed Louisiana's application
and decided that its hazardous waste program revision satisfies all of the requirements necessary to qualify for
Final Authorization. Unless adverse written comments are received during the review and comment period provided
for public participation in this process, EPA intends to approve Louisiana's hazardous waste program revision subject
to the authority retained by EPA in accordance with the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984. Louisiana's
application for the program revision is available for public review and comment.

A. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States with final authorization under section 3006(b) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA or the
Act''), 42 U.S.C. 6926(b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent
to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous waste program. Revisions to State hazardous
waste programs are necessary when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority is modified or when certain
other changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes to EPA's regulations in
40 CFR parts 124, 260 through 268, and 270.

B. Louisiana 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Louisiana initially received Final Authorization, effective February 7, 1985 (see 50 FR 3348), to implement its
base hazardous waste management program. Louisiana received authorization for revisions to its program effective
January 29, 1990 (see 54 FR 48889), and October 25, 1991 (see 56 FR 41958, and Corrections at 56 FR 51762). On September
22, 1994, Louisiana submitted a final complete program revision application for additional program approvals.
Today, Louisiana is seeking approval of its program revision in accordance with &sect;271.21(b)(3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1983, the Louisiana Legislature adopted Act 97, which amended and reenacted Louisiana Revised Statutes 30:1051
et seq., the Environmental Affairs Act. This Act created the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ),
which has lead agency jurisdictional authority for administering the RCRA Subtitle C program in the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA reviewed LDEQ's application, and made an immediate final decision that LDEQ's hazardous waste program revision
satisfies all of the requirements necessary to qualify for Final Authorization. Consequently, EPA intends to grant
Final Authorization for the additional program modifications to the State. The public may submit written comments
on EPA's final decision until December 22, 1994. Copies of LDEQ's application for program revision are available
for inspection and copying at the locations indicated in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 section of this document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approval of LDEQ's program revision shall become effective 75 days from the date this notice is published, unless
an adverse written comment pertaining to the State's revision discussed in this notice is received by the end of the
comment period. If an adverse written comment is received, EPA will publish either: (1) A withdrawal of the immediate
final decision; or (2) a notice containing a response to the comment that either affirms that the immediate final decision
takes effect or reverses the decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Louisiana's program revision application includes State regulatory changes that are at least equivalent to the
rules promulgated in the Federal RCRA implementing regulations in 40 CFR parts 124, 260&hyph;262, 264, 265, 266 and
270, that were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 through June 30, 1987. This proposed approval includes the provisions that are listed in the chart below. This chart
also lists the State analogs that are being recognized as equivalent to the appropriate Federal requirements.

The changes addressed by this Checklist were superseded by RCRA Revision Checklist 23. LDEQ made the changes required
by Checklist 23 rather than those addressed by this Checklist. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
LHWR do not recognize EPA's category of Conditionally Exempt Small Quantity Generators. Instead, all Small Quantity
Generators (SQGs) in Louisiana are subject to the State's SQG regulations and most LHWR applicable to Generators
other than SQGs. This makes the State's SQG regulations More Stringent than EPA's.

C. Decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
I conclude that LDEQ's application for a program revision meets the statutory and regulatory requirements established
by RCRA. Accordingly, LDEQ is granted Final Authorization to operate its hazardous waste program as revised. Louisiana
now has responsibility for permitting treatment, storage, and disposal facilities within its borders and for carrying
out the aspects of the RCRA program described in its revised program application, subject to the limitations of the
HSWA. Louisiana also has primary enforcement responsibilities, although EPA retains the right to conduct inspections
under section 3007 of RCRA, and to take enforcement actions under sections 3008, 3013 and 7003 of RCRA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA uses 40 CFR part 272 for codification of the decision to authorize LDEQ's program and for incorporation by reference
of those provisions of its Statutes and regulations that EPA will enforce under sections 3008, 3013, and 7003 of RCRA.
Therefore, EPA is reserving amendment of 40 CFR part 272, subpart L until a later date.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the provisions of 4 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this authorization will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This authorization effectively suspends the applicability
of certain Federal regulations in favor of Louisiana's program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements
for handlers of hazardous waste in the State. This authorization does not impose any new burdens on small entities.
This rule, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

 This order partially revokes the Presidential Proclamation of March 21, 1917, insofar as it affects 375.74 acres
of public land withdrawn for classification purposes. The withdrawal is no longer needed, and the revocation is needed
to permit disposal of the land. This action will open the land to surface entry and nonmetalliferous mining, unless
closed by overlapping withdrawals or temporary segregations of record. The land has been and will remain open to metalliferous
mining and mineral leasing.

and the requirements of applicable law. Appropriation of any of the land described in this order under the general
mining laws prior to the date and time of restoration is unauthorized. Any such attempted appropriation, including
attempted adverse possession under 30 U.S.C. 38 (1988), shall vest no rights against the United States. Acts required
to establish a location and to initiate a right of possession are governed by State law where not in conflict with Federal
law. The Bureau of Land Management will not intervene in disputes between rival locators over possessory rights since
Congress has provided for such determinations in local courts.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
By this action the Commission addressed ten petitions for reconsideration that seek revisions to various service
rules governing broadband Personal Communications Services (PCS). The changes adopted are limited to revisions
in the cross-ownership restrictions, that will serve to expand participation in the broadband PCS spectrum auction
scheduled to commence December 5, 1994, and to revisions of technical rules governing PCS radio signal transmission.
The expanded auction participation will serve to increase the number of potential PCS licensees, while the latter,
technical changes will enhance the flexibility of equipment manufacturers in designing products that comply with
Commission regulations, and so reduce the ultimate cost of service to PCS consumers.

Summary of Order
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By this order, the Commission amends in minor respects its broadband Personal Communications Services (``PCS'')
regulatory structure to better achieve the four primary goals of this proceeding: competitive delivery, a diverse
array of services, rapid deployment, and wide-area coverage. The Commission takes this action in response to ten
petitions for reconsideration or clarification of policies and rules adopted in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Broadband PCS Reconsideration
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 order. The Commission denies those petitions in major part because they principally raise issues the Commission
has considered at length in previous orders in this Docket.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By this action, the Commission modifies existing rules in only limited respects. First, the Commission permits entities
with non-controlling, attributable cellular interests to bid on ``in-market'' 30 MHz PCS licenses, conditioned
on post-auction compliance with existing cellular/PCS cross-ownership rules within 90 days of PCS license grant.
Second, the Commission clarifies the requirements for isochronous devices operating in the 1920&hyph;1930 MHz
sub-band. Third, the Commission clarifies its rule governing broadband PCS emission limits. Fourth, the Commission
makes certain housekeeping amendments to the Table of Frequency Allocations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In denying the reconsideration petitions in principal part, the Commission: (1) Affirms existing license eligibility
and ownership attribution rules in principal part; (2) denies without prejudice a proposal to require PCS licenses
to share the costs of relocating microwave licensees from the 1850&hyph;1990 MHz PCS Band; (3) declines to change
PCS service area definitions; (4) affirms an existing rule that divides Puerto Rico into two Basic Trading Areas for
licensing purposes; (5) declines a request to interpret the meaning of correspondence between AIDE and Rand McNally
Corporation regarding the latter's agreement to license the terms Metropolitan Trading Area and Basic Trading Area;
(6) determines that the question whether to impose Open Network Architecture regulation on PCS licensees is outside
the scope of this proceeding; (7) denies requests to modify the emission mask for licensed PCS bands and to make other
changes to technical PCS rules; (8) determines that it is unnecessary to impose special technical requirements on
PCS licensees in Block C in order to prevent their operations from interfering with adjacent Broadcast Auxiliary
Service licensees; and (9) defers to a pending Mobile Satellite Service (MSS) proceeding the question whether to
establish a secondary allocation of MSS in PCS Blocks F and C (1970&hyph;1990 MHz).

(1) Immediately prior to initiating transmission, devices must monitor the combined time and spectrum windows in
which they intend to transmit for a period of at least 10 milliseconds for systems designed to use a 10 milliseconds
or shorter frame period or at least 20 milliseconds for systems designed to use a 20 milliseconds frame period.

(5) If access to spectrum is not available as determined by the above, and a minimum of 40 duplex system access channels
are defined for the system, the time and spectrum windows with the lowest power level below a monitoring threshold
of 50 dB above the thermal noise power determined for the emission bandwidth may be accessed. A device utilizing the
provisions of this paragraph must have monitored all access channels defined for its system within the last 10 seconds
and must verify, within the 20 milliseconds (40 milliseconds for devices designed to use a 20 milliseconds frame period)
immediately preceding actual channel access that the detected power of the selected time and spectrum windows is
no higher than the previously detected value. The power measurement resolution for this comparsion must be accurate
to within 6 dB. No device or group of cooperating devices located within 1 meter of each other shall occupy more than
three 1.25 MHz channels during any frame period. Devices in an operational state that are utilizing the provisions
of this section are not required to use the search provisions of paragraph (b) of this section.

(e) The frame period (a set of consecutive time slots in which the position of each time slot can be identified by reference
to a synchronizing source) of an intentional radiator operating in these sub-bands shall be 20 milliseconds or 20
milliseconds/X where X is a positive whole number. Each device that implements time division for the purposes of maintaining
a duplex connection on a given frequency carrier shall maintain a frame repetition rate with a frequency stability
of at least 50 parts per million (ppm). Each device which further divides access in time in order to support multiple
communication links on a given frequency carrier shall maintain a frame repetition rate with a frequency stability
of at least 10 ppm. The jitter (time-related, abrupt, spurious variations in the duration of the frame interval) introduced
at the two ends of such a communication link shall not exceed 25 microseconds for any two consecutive transmissions.
Transmissions shall be continuous in every time and spectrum window during the frame period defined for the device.

 Parties holding controlling or attributable ownership interests in cellular licenses may be a party to a broadband
PCS application (i.e., have a controlling or attributable interest in a broadband PCS applicant), and such PCS applicant
will be eligible for more than one 10 MHz broadband PCS license and/or MHz PCS license(s) pursuant to the divestiture
procedures set forth in paragraphs (f) (1) through (3) of this section; Provided, however, that these divestiture
procedures shall be available only to: parties with controlling or attributable ownership interests in cellular
licenses where the CGSA(s) covers 20 percent or less of the PCS service area population; and parties with non-controlling
attributable interests in cellular licenses, regardless of the degree to which the CGSA(s) covers the PCS service
area population. For purposes of this paragraph, a ``non-controlling attributable interest'' is one in which the
holder has less than a fifty (50) percent voting interest and there is an unaffiliated single holder of a fifty (50)
percent or greater voting interest.

(a) On any frequency outside a licensee's frequency block, the power of any emission shall be attenuated below the
transmitter power (P) by at least 43 + 10 log (P) dB.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Compliance with these provisions is based on the use of measurement instrumentation employing a resolution bandwidth
of 1 MHz or greater. However, in the 1 MHz bands immediately outside and adjacent to the frequency block a resolution
bandwidth of at least one percent of the emission bandwidth of the fundamental emission of the transmitter may be employed.
The emission bandwidth is defined as the width of the signal between two points, one below the carrier center frequency
and one above the carrier center frequency, outside of which all emissions are attenuated at least 26 dB below the transmitter
power.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) When measuring the emission limits, the nominal carrier frequency shall be adjusted as close to the licensee's
frequency block edges, both upper and lower, as the design permits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The measurements of emission power can be expressed in peak or average values, provided they are expressed in the
same parameters as the transmitter power.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) When an emission outside of the authorized bandwidth causes harmful interference, the Commission may, at its
discretion, require greater attenuation than specified in this section.
