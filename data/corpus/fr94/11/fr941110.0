<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule without change, the provisions of an interim
final rule which authorized the use of smaller sized olives in the production of limited use styles for California
olives during the 1994&hyph;95 crop year. This rule is intended to allow more olives into fresh market channels and
is consistent with current market demand for olives. As required under section 8e of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement
Act of 1937, this rule also changes the olive import regulation.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement No. 148 and Order No. 932 (7 CFR Part 932), as amended, regulating the
handling of olives grown in California, hereinafter referred to as the order. The order is effective under the Agricultural
Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), hereinafter referred to as the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is also issued under section 8e of the Act, which requires the Secretary of Agriculture to issue grade, size,
quality, or maturity requirements for certain listed commodities, including olives, imported into the United States
that are the same as, or comparable to, those requirements imposed upon the domestic commodities regulated under
the Federal marketing orders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have retroactive
effect. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions
of import regulations issued under section 8e of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. Import regulations issued
under the Act are based on those established under Federal marketing orders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are 5 handlers of California olives that will be subject to regulation under the order during the current season,
and there are about 1,200 olive producers in California. There are approximately 25 importers of olives subject to
the olive import regulation. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration
(13 CFR 121.601) as those whose annual receipts are less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms, which
include handlers and importers, have been defined by the Small Business Administration as those having annual receipts
of less than $5,000,000. None of the domestic olive handlers may be classified as small entities. The majority of olive
producers and importers may be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nearly all of the olives grown in the United States are produced in California. The growing areas are scattered throughout
California with most of the commercial production coming from inland valleys. The majority of olives are produced
in central California. California olives are primarily used for canned ripe whole and whole pitted olives which are
eaten out of hand as hors d'oeuvres or used as an ingredient in cooking and in salads. The canned ripe olive market is
essentially a domestic market. A few shipments of California olives are exported.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Olive production has fluctuated from a low of 24,200 tons during the 1972&hyph;73 crop year to a high of 163,023 tons
during the 1992&hyph;93 crop year. The California Olive Committee (committee) indicated that 1993&hyph;94 production
totalled about 120,049 tons. Total production for the 1994&hyph;95 crop year is estimated to be 95,000 tons. Because
olive trees need to restore their nutrients from one season to the next, various varieties of olives produced in California
have alternate bearing tendencies. This results in high production one year and low the next, which usually causes
the total crop to vary greatly from year to year. This crop year's estimated production is expected to be smaller than
last year due to weather conditions early in the season which resulted in poor fruit pollination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, based on past production and marketing experience, the committee believes that handlers will need smaller
sized olives during the 1994&hyph;95 crop year to meet market demand for limited use styles of canned olives. Limited
use olives are too small to meet the minimum size requirements established for whole and whole pitted canned ripe olives.
However, they are large enough to be suitable for processing into limited use styles such as wedges, halves, slices,
or segments. Absent this action, olives which are smaller than those authorized for whole and whole pitted canning
uses would have to be disposed of by handlers into non-canning uses such as crushing into oil. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a)(3) of &sect;932.52 of the order provides that processed olives smaller than the sizes prescribed for
whole and whole pitted styles may be used for limited uses if recommended by the committee and approved by the Secretary.
Until October 1, 1991, paragraph (a)(3) also prescribed minimum sizes, by variety group, which could be authorized
for use in the production of limited use styles by the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Effective October 1, 1991, certain non-canning size disposition requirements specified in &sect;932.51(a)(3)
and minimum sizes authorized for limited use specified in &sect;932.52(a)(3) of the marketing order were suspended.
The committee may now recommend the use of olives for limited uses that are smaller than those previously permitted
under the order. Minimum size and grade requirements may be recommended annually by the committee and approved by
the Secretary. During the past three crop years, 1991&hyph;92, 1992&hyph;93, and 1993&hyph;94, the committee recommended
sizes smaller than those previously authorized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The minimum sizes which could previously be authorized for limited uses were established in a 1971 amendment to the
marketing order. Olives smaller than the prescribed minimum sizes which could be authorized for limited uses had
to be disposed of through less profitable non-canning uses such as crushing for oil. Returns to producers are lower
on fruit used for such purposes. The use of smaller sized olives for limited use styles has been authorized in all but
two crop years since the order was promulgated in 1965. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule finalizes an interim final rule that will help growers and handlers to meet the growing market demand
for limited use style olives based upon current conditions. The limited use size requirements allow the use of sizes
which would otherwise have to be disposed of for less profitable, non-canning uses. Permitting the use of such smaller
olives for limited use styles would therefore improve grower returns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 13, 1994, the committee recommended by a vote of 15&hyph;1, to establish grade and size regulations for limited
use size olives during the 1994&hyph;95 crop year pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of &sect;932.52 of the order. The one
handler member who dissented was concerned that approval of limited use size olives would be detrimental to handlers,
due to already large inventories of such olives from the two previous seasons. The recommended grade and size requirements
are the same as those established during the 1990&hyph;91 crop year, which means slightly larger minimum sizes than
were in effect during the 1991&hyph;92, 1992&hyph;93, and 1993&hyph;94 crop years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The specified sizes for the different olive variety groups are the minimum sizes which are deemed desirable for use
in the production of limited use styles at this time. As in past years, permitting the use of the smaller olives in the
production of limited use styles allowed handlers to take advantage of the strong market for halved, segmented, sliced,
and chopped canned ripe olives. Handlers will be able to market more olives with this relaxation in size requirements
than under regulations effective prior to the interim final rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The committee also based its decision on certain production and market factors. The last three crop years were the
first crop years that limited use olives were authorized at sizes below the 1990&hyph;91 crop year minimum size requirements.
Prior to the 1990&hyph;91 crop year, the committee investigated limited use olives that were below permitted minimum
sizes. From investigations and surveys within the industry, the committee determined that limited use olives below
1990&hyph;91 minimum sizes could be efficiently sliced using current technology. However, consumer interest in
and need for such olives also had to be determined, specifically for smaller sliced olive rings. Thus, minimum size
requirements below the 1990&hyph;91 crop year were recommended and became effective for limited use olives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the following three seasons, the industry experienced a higher percentage of broken pieces in the smaller
olives than with the slightly larger sizes. The U.S. Standards for Grades of Canned Ripe Olives (Standards) define
a broken piece as any piece of olive that is less than three quarters of a full unit. This situation had a negative impact
on the California olive market as the extra broken pieces caused customers to complain about the lack of uniformity
and poorer quality of product from these smaller sizes. Such olives also had to compete with imported sliced olives
that had fewer broken pieces. Therefore, the committee recommended slightly larger minimum size requirements for
limited use olives in order to improve the quality of and enhance the market for California limited use olives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, the committee estimates that production for this crop year is expected to be at 95,000 tons, which is smaller
than the previous two seasons. Weather conditions early in the crop year caused poor pollination resulting in a smaller
crop with an uneven distribution of sizes. The 1992&hyph;93 and 1993&hyph;94 crop years produced large crops of 163,023
tons and 120,049 tons, respectively. During years with large olive crops, the ratio of limited use olives to other
sizes tends to be higher; there are more limited use size olives in proportion to the other sizes. During years with
small olive crops, the ratio of smaller olives to other sizes is smaller; there tends to be fewer limited use size olives
in proportion to the other sizes. The increased availability of limited use sized fruit could be reflected in handler
processing for the last three seasons. For example, during the 1992&hyph;93 crop year, 19 percent of the olives (163,024
tons) processed by handlers were limited use, and during the 1991&hyph;92 crop year, 11 percent of total olives (63,259
tons) processed by handlers were limited use. Although limited use minimum sizes were larger during the 1990&hyph;91
season, limited use olives processed by handlers were 16 percent of total olives (126,879 tons) purchased by handlers.
Thus, unlike the two previous seasons, fewer small limited use olives are expected to be harvested this season. The
percentage of limited use olives is expected to be smaller. The slight increase in minimum limited use size requirements
being established for the 1994&hyph;95 season is therefore not expected to greatly impact available supplies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, it is found that permitting limited use olives as recommended by the committee is expected to improve market
conditions, and grower returns, and meet market needs for limited use style olives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 8(e) of the Act requires that whenever grade, size, quality, or maturity requirements are in effect for olives
under a domestic marketing order, imported olives must meet the same or comparable requirements. This action allows
smaller olives for limited use styles under the marketing order. Therefore, a corresponding change is needed in the
olive import regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Canned ripe olives, and bulk olives for processing into canned ripe olives, imported into the United States must meet
certain minimum grade and size requirements specified in Olive Regulation 1 (7 CFR 944.401). All canned ripe olives
are required to be inspected and certified prior to importation (release from custody of the United States Custom
Service), and all bulk olives for processing into canned ripe olives must be inspected and certified prior to canning.
``Canned ripe olives'' means olives in hermetically sealed containers and heat sterilized under pressure, of two
distinct types, ``ripe'' and ``green-ripe'', as defined in the Standards. The term does not include Spanish-style
green olives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any lot of olives failing to meet the import requirements may be exported, disposed of, or shipped for exempt uses.
Exportation or disposal of such olives would be accomplished under the supervision of the Processed Products Branch
of the Fruit and Vegetable Division, with the costs of certifying the disposal of the olives borne by the importer.
Exempt olives are those imported for processing into oil or donation to charity. Any person may also import up to 100
pounds (drained weight) of canned ripe olives or bulk olives exempt from these grade and size requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule finalizes an interim final rule that modified paragraph (b)(12) of the olive import regulation to
authorize the importation of bulk olives which do not meet the minimum size requirements established for olives for
whole and whole pitted uses to be used in the production of limited use styles during the 1994&hyph;1995 crop year.
This rule also finalizes establishment of size regulations for such olives in paragraph (b)(12).

The committee recommended authorizing establishment of minimum sizes for use in the production of limited use styles
during the 1994&hyph;95 crop year. The sizes are specified in terms of minimum weights for individual olives in various
variety groups and are the same for both domestic and imported olives. An extra category is continued in the import
regulation to apply comparable requirements for varieties not grown domestically. The minimum sizes for import
requirements are as follows:

Each of the categories includes a 35 percent tolerance for olives weighing less than the specified minimum size.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Continuing to permit the use of smaller olives in the production of limited use styles will allow importers to take
better advantage of the strong market for halved, segmented, sliced, and chopped canned ripe olives. Importers will
be able to import and market more olives than would be permitted under regulations prior to the interim final rule that
relaxed size requirements. This additional opportunity is provided to maximize the use of the available olive supply
and facilitate market expansion. Prior to the interim final rule, the smaller fruit could not be imported for limited
uses, and would have to be disposed of through less profitable, non-canning uses under the supervision of the inspection
service, exported, or utilized in exempt outlets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these considerations, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 8e of the Act, the U.S. Trade Representative has concurred with the issuance of this final
rule.

After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the committee's recommendation, and other available

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Title III of the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvements Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;325, 108
Stat. 2160) (the Act) contains a number of measures to reduce the burden of federal regulation on depository institutions.
Title III, section 308, amended the Federal Reserve Act to repeal the requirement in section 9, paragraph 6 (12 U.S.C.
324) that state member banks publish their reports of condition. Section 308 also removed similar publication requirements
in the National Bank Act and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board's Regulation H, Membership of State Banking Institutions in the Federal Reserve System, currently requires
that a state member bank publish its report of condition (Forms FFIEC 031&hyph;034) within 20 days of the date the call
for a report of condition is issued. 12 CFR 208.10(a). The report of condition is included in the Consolidated Reports
of Condition and Income, usually referred to as the ``Call Report,'' that state member banks generally are required
to submit on a quarterly basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to achieve the reduction in regulatory burden intended under the Act, the Board is removing the provisions
of Regulation H that require publication of a state member bank's report of condition. The amendments delete paragraphs
(a) and (b) of &sect;208.10 of the regulation. Additionally, the section is renamed to reflect the subject of the remaining
paragraph, in which the Board exercises its authority under section 21 of the Federal Reserve Act to waive submission
of reports of affiliates by state member banks required under section 9 of the Federal Reserve Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board notes that a bank's Call Reports, including its reports of condition, will continue to be publicly available
through the National Technical Information Service of the United States Department of Commerce under the Board's
Rules Regarding Availability of Information. See 12 CFR 261.6(c)(3). Additionally, state member banks will continue
to be required to advise shareholders, customers, and the general public of the availability of year-end Call Reports
or other financial information under &sect;208.17 of Regulation H. See 12 CFR 208.17. The Board believes that these
provisions are sufficient to ensure that adequate information is available to the public with respect to the condition
of a state member bank. Additionally, the amendment has no effect on any publication requirements that may be imposed
on a state member bank under state law.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice and Public Participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act relating to notice and public participation (5 U.S.C. 553(b))
have not been followed in connection with the adoption of these amendments, as the amendments implement a statutory
provision that is intended to reduce the regulatory burden on banks. The Board therefore finds good cause for determining,
and so determines, that notice and public participation are unnecessary and contrary to the public interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions of the Act relating to notice of the effective date of a rule (5 U.S.C. 553(d)) have not been followed
in connection with the adoption of these amendments. Section 308 of the Act was effective as of the date of enactment
(September 24, 1994), and the Board is amending Regulation H promptly to implement the statutory provision. For this
reason, the Board finds there is good cause to determine, and so determines, that notice is not necessary and would
be contrary to the purpose of section 308. These amendments have therefore been published in final with an immediate
effective date.

Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the Board finds that no notice of proposed rulemaking is required, a statement concerning the effects of the
rule on small entities is also not required under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 5 U.S.C. 604. The Board notes, however,
that the proposed amendments will reduce the regulatory burden imposed on all state member banks. The amendments
should be particularly helpful to smaller institutions for which the publication requirement represent a more significant
cost burden.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series
airplanes, that requires inspections to detect cracks of certain demountable flange (inboard) wheel subassemblies
and of the bolt bosses on certain demountable flange (outboard) wheel subassemblies, and modification or replacement
of the wheel subassemblies. This amendment is prompted by reports of cracks and broken spokes found on certain main
wheel assemblies of these airplanes. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent loss of a main wheel assembly
during takeoff or landing.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to certain Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on February 28, 1994 (59 FR 9450). That action proposed to require inspections to detect cracks of certain demountable
flange (inboard) wheel subassemblies and of the bolt bosses on certain demountable flange (outboard) wheel subassemblies,
and modification or replacement of the wheel subassemblies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter supports the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requests that proposed paragraphs (a) and (b) be revised to provide credit for inspections accomplished
within the last 500 landings before the final rule becomes effective. This commenter has been performing the repetitive
inspections proposed in the AD. The commenter indicates that accomplishment of these inspections has proven to provide
an acceptable level of safety by detecting all cracking before a critical cumulative defect size has been exceeded.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA does not concur with the commenter's request. The FAA finds that the requested change is unnecessary because
such credit is provided by the statement in the AD, ``Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously.'' Any
operator that has accomplished the required inspections may take credit for those inspections provided that the
repetitive inspections are accomplished in accordance with the requirements of this AD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The same commenter also requests that paragraphs (a)(1) and (b)(1) of the proposed rule be revised to clarify that
the modification must be accomplished prior to further flight following the third inspection accomplished after
the effective date of the AD. Since the commenter has been conducting the proposed inspections, the FAA infers from
this commenter's request that it would like credit for those inspections without having to modify the wheel subassemblies
sooner than the AD would require had the operator not conducted any inspections.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA concurs that clarification is necessary, and has revised paragraphs (a)(1) and (b)(1) of the final rule to
clarify its intent that the modification must be accomplished prior to further flight following the third inspection
accomplished after the effective date of this AD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This commenter also requests that paragraph (c) of the proposed rule be revised to delete the words ``and modified.''
The commenter points out that wheel subassemblies that are inspected in accordance with the proposal may remain in
service until the third inspection after the effective date of the AD, at which time those subassemblies must be modified.
Therefore, a wheel subassembly that has been inspected in accordance with the proposed rule would be considered to
be safe. The FAA finds that clarification is necessary. Paragraph (c) of the final rule has been revised to specify
that certain parts may not be installed on the airplane unless the part has been inspected and subsequently modified
in accordance with the requirements of this AD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has revised paragraphs (a)(2) and (b)(2) of the final rule to indicate that the replacement procedures required
by those paragraphs are found in the Airplane Maintenance Manual. This information was omitted inadvertently from
the proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined
that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 87 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 14
work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based
on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $66,990, or $770 per airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under
the caption

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain Bombardier Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B19 series airplanes, that requires modification of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the stall protection system (SPS) input wiring; a revision to the FAA-approved Airplane 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Flight Manual (AFM) to specify that a pre-flight check of the slip/skid indications must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be conducted prior to engine start; and modification of the stall protection computer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(SPC) to accept restored dual attitude and heading reference system (AHRS) input. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendment is prompted by a report that the AHRS could send conflicting input to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SPC on the airplane. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent the loss of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stall warning protection on the airplanes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to certain Bombardier Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B19 (Regional Jet Series 100) series airplanes
was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 4, 1994 (59 FR 10340). That action proposed to require modification of the stall protection system (SPS) input
wiring; a revision to the Normal Procedures section of the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to specify that
a pre-flight check of the slip/skid indications must be conducted prior to engine start; and modification of the attitude
and heading reference system (AHRS) to restore the dual AHRS inputs to the SPC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requests that the FAA revise the final rule to indicate that it is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the AHRS that will be modified, but the stall protection computer (SPC). The FAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concurs, and has revised the preamble and paragraph (c) of the final rule to clarify its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intent that the SPC be modified to restore the dual AHRS inputs to the SPC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter also requests that the proposed compliance time of 6 months for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modification of the SPC, as specified in paragraph (c) of the proposed rule, be extended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
due to the complex nature of the SPC modification and the need to modify additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment to support the SPC change. The commenter proposes a target date of April 4, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1995, for accomplishment of the modification. As justification for this suggested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extension, the commenter states that the SPC software will detect a loss of AHRS input to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both SPC channels, and a ``STALL FAIL'' amber message will be displayed; additionally, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the AFM defines abnormal procedures to be followed when loss of the SPS occurs. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter adds that there are several components in the SPS that can fail and cause the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loss of stall protection on any one flight. The commenter believes that the loss of AHRS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
input is no worse than, and the system is just as reliable as, a system with two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
independent AHRS inputs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA does not concur. Compliance times for AD's are normally based on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameter related to failure of a particular component. The FAA has determined that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there is no apparent direct relationship between the transmittal of conflicting input from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the AHRS to the SPC (and subsequent loss of stall warning protection on the airplane) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and a calendar date. Therefore, the FAA does not consider that the compliance time for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modification of the SPC should be expressed in terms of a calendar date, as suggested by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the commenter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, in developing a compliance time for this requirement of the rule, the FAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered not only the safety implications, but the availability of required parts and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practical aspect of installing the required modification within a maximum interval of time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowable for all affected airplanes to continue to operate without compromising safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of these items, the FAA finds that a compliance time of 6 months is appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Additionally, based on the effective date of this final rule, the compliance time for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators to perform the modification will fall close to the calendar date requested by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new paragraph (d) has been added to the final rule to clarify the FAA's intent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that modification of the SPC constitutes terminating action for the AFM revision required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by paragraph (b) of this AD. Therefore, once the SPC is modified, the AFM revision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be removed from the AFM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined that these changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 9 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it will take approximately 2 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. The cost for required parts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be minimal. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators is estimated to be $990, or $110 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain British Aerospace Model ATP airplanes, that requires modification of the power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supply for the communications system. This amendment is prompted by reports of loss 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of power to the communications system due to an electrical fault in the ground crew jack 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
box or the handset of the public address (PA) system. The actions specified by this AD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are intended to prevent the inability of the flight crew to communicate with passengers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
via the PA system and with air traffic control due to loss of power to the communication 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system, which may lead to unsafe operation of the airplane.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to certain British Aerospace Model ATP airplanes series airplanes was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 11, 1994 (59 FR 24382). That action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed to require modification of the power supply for the communications system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this amendment. No comments were submitted in response to the proposal or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA's determination of the cost to the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since issuance of the notice, Jetstream has issued errata sheets Numbers 1, 2, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4, pertaining to Service Bulletin ATP&hyph;23&hyph;21&hyph;35288A. Erratum No. 1 was issued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
March 14, 1994, and adds an additional part number to the list of pertinent cable looms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that appeared in Revision 2 of Jetstream Service Bulletin ATP&hyph;23&hyph;21&hyph;35288A. Erratum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No. 2 was issued April 25, 1994, and corrects certain editorial errors that appeared in that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same service bulletin. Erratum No. 4 was issued June 1, 1994, and includes an additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference to the fuse and circuit breaker index that appeared in that same service bulletin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule has been revised to add a note referencing the existence of these errata 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sheets. These errata sheets do not require any further work by operators who have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously complied with Jetstream Service Bulletin ATP&hyph;23&hyph;21&hyph;35288A, Revision 2, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dated February 15, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, the FAA has determined that air safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the change previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described. The FAA has determined that this change will neither increase the economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 10 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it will take approximately 30 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. Required parts will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided by the manufacturer at no cost to the operator. Based on these figures, the total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $18,000, or $1,800 per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to all McDonnell Douglas Model
DC&hyph;8&hyph;70 series airplanes, that currently requires replacement of all attachment screws at the exhaust
nozzle plug splice, and a check of nut plates for running torque and replacement of nut plates, if necessary. This amendment
requires modification of the engine exhaust plug assemblies as terminating action for the currently required replacement
and check. This amendment is prompted by reports of loose or missing attachments at the splice joint of the engine forward
and aft 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exhaust plugs, and loss of the rear exhaust plug following an engine bird strike. The actions specified by this AD are
intended to prevent reduced integrity of the engine exhaust plug installation, which may lead to separation of exhaust
plugs from the airplane, and create a hazard to persons and property on the ground.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) by superseding AD 83&hyph;02&hyph;05,
amendment 39&hyph;4544 (48 FR 5539, February 7, 1983), which is applicable to all McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;8&hyph;70
series airplanes, was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 27, 1994 (59 FR 38144). The action proposed to require replacement of all attachment screws at the exhaust nozzle
plug splice, and a check of nut plates for running torque and replacement of nut plates, if necessary. The action also
proposed to require modification of the engine exhaust plug assemblies; when accomplished, this modification would
terminate the need for the currently required replacement and check.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the two comments received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter supports the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requests that the compliance time for the accomplishment of the modification be extended from the proposed
24 months to 60 months. This commenter states that it would have to procure additional spare engines and would need
to special schedule its fleet of airplanes to accomplish this modification within the proposed compliance time.
This would entail considerable expense over what was estimated in the FAA's cost impact analysis. The commenter indicates
that a compliance time of 60 months would allow the modification to be accomplished during regularly scheduled maintenance,
thereby eliminating any additional expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA does not concur. In developing an appropriate compliance time for this action, the FAA considered the safety
implications, parts availability, and the practical aspect of installing the required modification during normal
maintenance schedules. In light of this, the FAA does not consider it appropriate to change the compliance time for
all operators based on the unique circumstances of an individual operator. On the other hand, paragraph (c) of the
AD provides that an individual may request an adjustment of compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety,
and this would be the appropriate means for the commenter to seek the requested relief. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the change previously described. The FAA has determined
that this change will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 110 Model DC&hyph;8&hyph;70 series airplanes of the affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 78 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that
it will take approximately 46 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required modification, and that the average
labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $21,400 per airplane. Based on these figures,
the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,866,540, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or $23,930 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted.

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

The Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations adds the Chicago ARTCC as the controlling agency for
R&hyph;3302, Savanna, IL. This change was initiated by the Chicago ARTCC and coordinated with the U.S. Army to facilitate
joint use of the airspace. This will allow access for general aviation aircraft when the special use airspace is not
active. Because this action is a minor technical amendment in which the public is not particularly interested, I find
that notice and public procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are unnecessary. Section 73.33 of part 73 of the Federal Aviation
Regulations was republished in FAA Order 7400.8B dated March 9, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant
rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation
of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect
air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document amends the Customs Regulations by making certain technical corrections necessitated by one of the
Customs Modernization provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, which went into
effect when signed on December 8, 1993. The changes involve the time period that Customs must retain goods seized for
certain intellectual property violations before the goods can be sold.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Customs Modernization provisions contained in Title VI of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation
Act of 1993, Public Law 103&hyph;182, 107 Stat. 2057 (the NAFTA Act), went into effect when the NAFTA Act was signed
on December 8, 1993 (section 692 of the NAFTA Act). One of the changes effected by this legislation was an amendment
to 19 U.S.C. 1526(e)(3), which involves the time period for retention of goods seized by Customs for certain intellectual
property rights violations. Section 663 of the NAFTA Act amended 19 U.S.C. 1526(e)(3) to allow Customs to sell merchandise
bearing a counterfeit trademark at a public auction 90 days after the forfeiture of the merchandise if Customs has
determined that a need for the merchandise has not been established by any federal, state, or local government or eleemosynary
institution. Prior to this amendment, the statute had required Customs to wait more than one year before the sale of
the merchandise by appropriate Customs officers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of the changes in 19 U.S.C. 526(e)(3), corresponding changes are required in the Customs Regulations,
in &sect;133.52(c)(3) (19 CFR 133.52(c)(3)).

Discussion of Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 19 CFR 133.52(c)(3), the time period is changed from ``one year'' to ``90 days,'' and the entity responsible for
the sale is changed from ``the Commissioner or his designee'' to ``the Customs Service.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Inasmuch as these amendments merely conform the Customs Regulations to existing law, pursuant to 5 U.S.C.(a)(2)
and (b)(3)(B), good cause exists for dispensing with notice and public procedure thereon as unnecessary. For the
same reason, good cause exists for dispensing with the requirement for a delayed effective date, under 5 U.S.C. (a)(2)
and (d)(3). Since this document is not subject to the notice and public procedure requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553, it is
not subject to the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

products. This amendment will enhance the U.S. textile import program and other programs or laws administered or

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Customs is confronted with a continuing problem involving textiles and textile products which, after exportation
from their country of origin, are transshipped through a second country, thereby facilitating a false or otherwise
unlawful statement, act, or omission regarding the country of origin of the merchandise when ultimately imported
and entered in the United States. Such statements, acts or omissions may impinge on a number of programs or laws administered
or enforced by Customs, including country of origin marking requirements, textile quota limitations and visa requirements
under the U.S. textile import program, duty assessment and collection, and collection of trade statistics. The consequences
of such unlawful statements, acts or omissions may include interference with the consumer's right to make an informed
decision regarding a prospective purchase, undermining of bilateral and multilateral textile agreements to which
the United States is a party and with resulting injury to domestic producers of textiles and textile products, loss
of revenue, and inability to maintain proper trade statistics to support overall U.S. trade policy and analysis.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 592 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1592), a penalty may be assessed against any party
who has committed fraud, gross negligence or negligence in connection with the unlawful entry of any merchandise
in the United States, including textiles and textile products that have been transshipped in the circumstances described
above. Provisions relating to the filing of petitions, and action upon petitions, for relief from fines, penalties
and forfeitures incurred under laws administered by Customs, including penalties under section 592, are set forth
in Part 171 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR Part 171). Appendix B to Part 171 sets forth Revised Penalty Guidelines
under section 592. Although Appendix B is not intended to have regulatory effect, it represents the official Customs
position regarding the standards that are generally applicable to the administrative review of petitions for remission
or mitigation of penalties incurred under section 592. Appendix B includes, in section (G), certain factors that
may be determined by Customs to be aggravating factors in arriving at a final administrative penalty decision. Appendix
B is currently undergoing review within Customs with a view to publication of a proposed revision of those guidelines,
with opportunity for public comment, in the near future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notwithstanding the upcoming revision of Appendix B to Part 171 and the intended solicitation of public comments
thereon, Customs determined that immediate action should be taken in a penalty mitigation context to address the
textile and textile products transshipment problem described above. Customs notes that transshipments have resulted
in material false statements, acts or omissions regarding the country of origin of the imported merchandise, including
false designations of origin. Consequently, it is Customs position that transshipment must be susceptible to treatment
as an aggravating factor in arriving at a final mitigated section 592 penalty decision under Part 171 of the regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 30, 1994, Customs published as T.D. 94&hyph;29 an interim rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 14745) to amend section (G) of Appendix B to Part 171 by adding a reference to ``transshipment in the case of textiles
and textile products affecting a country of origin determination'' as an aggravating factor. Although this change
was effective for merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after April 1, 1994, Customs
stated that it would consider any comments submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Customs received eleven comments in response to the interim rule. The comments received, and Customs responses to
them, where appropriate, are set forth below.

would serve as a useful deterrent to such unlawful practices.

Comments Opposing the Interim Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Regarding the eight commenters opposing the interim rule or seeking to limit its application, three claimed that
the interim rule unfairly discriminated against textile importers by holding such importers to a higher standard
of care than that required of parties importing other merchandise. Two of these three commenters indicated that it
was illogical for Customs to consider the act of transshipment an aggravating factor when, in fact, the act of transshipment
constitutes the violation in question or, at least, an element of the violation. Put another way, these two commenters
were of the opinion that aggravating factors cannot constitute the violation in question. Otherwise, according
to one of these commenters, undervaluation logically would have to be an aggravating factor in cases involving understatement
of value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two other commenters stated that the interim rule should be limited in its application to those instances where the
importer had actual knowledge of the improper transshipment of the textile products at issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the remaining three commenters fully opposed to the interim rule, they objected on the basis that the rule
constituted the imposition of unfair additional penalties and that mitigation in such cases would become meaningless.
These commenters felt that existing guidelines were adequate and that the interim rule was not in keeping with the
spirit of the recently enacted Customs Modernization Act. One of these commenters also expressed concern that the
rule would permit Customs to raise the assessed penalty in cases involving transshipment. Finally, one of the commenters
indicated that rules such as the interim rule have forced the closure of his apparel importing company.

Customs Response 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Customs acknowledges the concerns expressed by those commenters opposed to the interim rule on the basis that the
rule discriminates against textile importers, but the importing community and domestic industry must, in Customs
opinion, acknowledge the dilemma faced by the agency, namely, balancing the interests of the importer against the
explosion of illegal transshipments to the United States. Aside from the obvious negative impact such shipments
can have on domestic industry, illegally transshipped goods deceive U.S. consumers regarding the country of origin
of imported merchandise, as well as distort the application of bilateral agreements with our trading partners. When
faced with similar situations, Customs has had to take enforcement actions which focus on specific commodities or
types of merchandise. In effect, the interim rule provides a warning to textile importers about the threat of illegal
transshipment and suggests that such importers take extra pre-importation measures to ensure the accuracy of the
country of origin of the products in question. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contrary to some commenters' views, it is clear that these textile transshipments do not, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
per se,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 constitute a violation of section 1592. Such transshipments may, or may not, result in false statements concerning
the country of origin on entry documents, or goods being falsely marked with an incorrect country of origin. Consequently,
a violation occurs at the time when the transshipped textile goods arrive for entry in the United States and are falsely
marked, or the entry documents contain culpable, material false statements, omissions or acts. In other words, with
respect to the circumstances under discussion, the act of textile transshipment does not, in and of itself, constitute
a violation of section 1592. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to those commenters who recommended implementation of the rule provided that it only apply to those instances
where the importer has actual knowledge of the improper transshipment, Customs notes that application of this aggravating
factor would first require that Customs establish a violation of section 1592. If the importer is an innocent party
to the transaction, then that importer will not be considered culpable, and therefore, cannot be charged with a violation
of section 1592. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Customs also would like to clear up what appears to be a misunderstanding regarding the meaning of the term ``aggravating
factor'' and the practical impact of the presence of an aggravating factor in a penalty situation. First, as indicated
above, aggravating factors alone do not constitute a violation of section 1592. Second, contrary to some commenters'
belief, the presence of an aggravating factor does not increase or decrease the asserted level of culpability set
forth in Customs section 1592 prepenalty and/or penalty notices. For example, in the case of an importer's material
grossly negligent false statement of origin on an entry document, Customs does not increase the asserted level of
culpability to fraud because the goods were transshipped. Rather, in arriving at the administrative disposition
in a penalty action, Customs treats the presence of an aggravating factor (designated as such in the Customs guidelines)
as an offset to the presence of a mitigating factor. It should also be noted that because the interim rule involves Customs
penalty guidelines and such guidelines are neither statutory nor regulatory, per se, certain circumstances may
warrant deviation from the ordinary application of the guidelines.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Customs also is of the opinion that the interim rule is, in fact, in keeping with the spirit of the Customs Modernization
provisions (Title VI) of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the Act), Public Law 103&hyph;182,
107 Stat. 2057 (December 8, 1993). Both the language of the Act and its legislative history clearly set forth the concepts
of ``shared responsibility'' and ``informed compliance'' as critical to its effectiveness and application. In
the instant situation, the interim rule is one of the measures Customs intends to use to address the significant problem
of illegal transshipment. The interim rule informs the textile importer that he or she can avoid application of the
interim rule by taking adequate measures prior to importation to attempt to ensure the accuracy and completeness
of the information provided to Customs at the time of entry, including proper marking or other indication of the country
of origin of the articles. In light of the problems associated with illegal transshipment, Customs believes that
it is not unreasonable to expect textile importers to exert diligence in attempting to verify the source of their goods
prior to importation commensurate with the statutory requirement to exercise reasonable care in presenting documentation
to Customs during the entry process. If a textile importer can demonstrate that such measures were taken (i.e., the
importer was not culpable and acted with reasonable care), then there can be no violation of section 1592 because culpability
is a requisite element of such a violation. Put another way, the interim rule does not apply to those textile importers
who responsibly take such adequate measures prior to importation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In view of the foregoing, Customs is adopting the text of the interim rule as final without change.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 North Carolina has applied for final authorization of revisions to its hazardous waste program under the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). North Carolina's revisions consist of the provisions of HSWA Cluster I promulgated
November 8, 1984, through June 30, 1987. The Environmental Protection Agency has reviewed North Carolina's application
and has made a decision, subject to review and comment, that North Carolina's hazardous waste program revision satisfies
all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Thus, EPA intends to approve North Carolina's
hazardous waste program revisions. North Carolina's application for program revisions is available for public
review and comment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States with final authorization under Section 3006(b) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA'' or
``the Act''), 42 U.S.C. 6926(b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent
to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous waste program. In addition, as an interim measure,
the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (Public Law 98&hyph;616, November 8, 1984, hereinafter ``HSWA'')
allows States to revise their programs to become substantially equivalent instead of equivalent to RCRA requirements
promulgated under HSWA authority. States exercising the latter option receive ``interim authorization'' for the
HSWA requirements under Section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g), and later apply for final authorization for the
HSWA requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with Part 271, &sect;271.21(a) of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 271.21(a)), revisions
to State hazardous waste programs are necessary when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority is modified
or when certain other changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes to EPA's
regulations in 40 CFR parts 124, 260 through 268 and 270.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
North Carolina initially received final authorization for its base RCRA program effective on December 31, 1984,
(49 FR 48694). North Carolina most recently received final authorization effective June 3, 1994, for RCRA Cluster
II (59 FR 15633, April 4, 1994). On October 29, 1991, North Carolina submitted a program revision application for additional
program approval for the requirements of HSWA Cluster I. EPA granted North Carolina interim authorization for HSWA
Cluster I effective June 1, 1993. Today, North Carolina is seeking final authorization of its program revisions in
accordance with 40 CFR 271.21(b)(3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has reviewed North Carolina's application and has made an immediate final decision that North Carolina's hazardous
waste program revisions satisfy all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Consequently,
EPA intends to grant final authorization for the HSWA Cluster I program modifications to North Carolina. The public
may submit written comments on EPA's immediate final decision up until December 12, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copies of North Carolina's application for these program revisions are available for inspection and copying at the
locations indicated in the ``Addresses'' section of this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approval of North Carolina's program revisions shall become effective January 9, 1995, unless an adverse comment
pertaining to the State's revisions discussed in this notice is received by the end of the comment period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If an adverse comment is received, EPA will publish either: (1) A withdrawal of the immediate final decision; or (2)
a notice containing a response to comments which either affirms that the immediate final decision takes effect or
reverses the decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA issues, administers, and enforces RCRA hazardous waste permits, or portions of permits, that contain conditions
based upon the Federal program provisions for which the State has not received authorization. Upon the effective
date of this authorization, EPA will suspend issuance of any further permits under the provisions for which the State
is being authorized. Any permits, or portions of permits, that were issued by EPA prior to the effective date of this
authorization will be terminated pursuant to 40 CFR 124.5(d). Those permits, or portions of permits, issued by EPA
not terminated pursuant to 40 CFR 124.5(d) will either: (1) Be modified to allow for an earlier expiration date pursuant
to 40 CFR 270.41 (a); or (2) be administered by the State until the permit is reissued. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With the passage of the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), responsibilities for hazardous waste
permitting in North Carolina were split between EPA and the State. Upon receiving interim authorization for HSWA
corrective action, North Carolina assumed responsibility for HSWA corrective action for new permits. EPA continued
to administer and enforce federal permits issued prior to the interim authorization. Upon final authorization of
the State program for those provisions specified above, EPA will suspend issuance of federal permits in those areas
for which the State is receiving authorization. Additionally, EPA will terminate, pursuant to 40 CFR 124.5(d), federal
permits or portions of permits containing those provisions specified above and issued prior to the effective date
of this authorization. A discussion of how North Carolina and EPA will delineate permitting responsibilities is
contained in the EPA-North Carolina Memorandum of Agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
North Carolina is not authorized to operate the federal program on Indian lands. This authority remains with EPA unless
provided otherwise in a future statute or regulation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 05 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
I conclude that North Carolina's application for program revision meets all of the statutory and regulatory requirements
established by RCRA. Accordingly, North Carolina is granted final authorization to operate its hazardous waste
program as revised. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 05 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
North Carolina now has responsibility for permitting treatment, storage, and disposal facilities within its borders
and carrying out other aspects of the RCRA program described in its revised program application, subject to the limitations
of HSWA, the Memorandum of Agreement, and this notice. North Carolina also has primary enforcement responsibilities,
although EPA retains the right to conduct inspections under Section 3007 of RCRA and to take enforcement actions under
Sections 3008, 3013, and 7003 of RCRA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this authorization will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This authorization effectively suspends the applicability
of certain Federal regulations in favor of North Carolina's program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements
for handlers of hazardous waste in the State. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The modified base (100-year) flood elevations are not listed for each community in this interim rule. However, the
address of the Chief Executive Officer of the community where the modified base flood elevation determinations are
available for inspection is provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any request for reconsideration must be based upon knowledge of changed conditions, or upon new scientific or technical
data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The modifications are made pursuant to section 201 of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4105, and
are in accordance with the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. 4001 et seq., and with 44 CFR part 65. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For rating purposes, the currently effective community number is shown and must be used for all new policies and renewals.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The modified base (100-year) flood elevations are the basis for the floodplain management measures that the community
is required to either adopt or to show evidence of being already in effect in order to qualify or to remain qualified
for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These modified elevations, together with the floodplain management criteria required by 44 CFR 60.3, are the minimum
that are required. They should not be construed to mean that the community must change any existing ordinances that
are more stringent in their floodplain management requirements. The community may at any time enact stricter requirements
of its own, or pursuant to policies established by other Federal, state or regional entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes in base flood elevations are in accordance with 44 CFR 65.4.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS issues a final rule to implement selected measures of Amendment 8 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Crustacean
Fisheries of the Western Pacific Region (FMP). The rule eliminates a 2-year landing requirement for permit renewal,
which had an unintended detrimental effect on lobster fishery permit holders. The rule also modifies existing notification
and reporting procedures. The implemented changes are intended to improve administration, monitoring, and enforcement
of the fishery.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The WPFMC developed Amendment 8 to the FMP and submitted it to NMFS for approval. A proposed rule to implement Amendment
8 was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 9, 1994 (59 FR 40515). The proposed rule provided background on the following provisions of Amendment 8:
(1) Removing the requirement for a vessel to land at least four lobsters for each trap normally used during 1 of the 2
most recent years in which fishing was allowed as a condition of permit renewal; (2) establishing a framework procedure
for reviewing, with the possibility of changing, the target catch-per-unit-of effort (CPUE) used in the formula
to derive the quota for the fishery from 1.0 lobster per trap-haul to a number that is more reflective of the current
status of the lobster resource; (3) establishing a framework procedure authorizing, under some circumstances,
fishing for the purposes of obtaining fisheries data or alleviating economic hardship, when the initial quota is
zero; (4) requiring vessel owners to notify NMFS of the location and time of offloading of their catch; and (5) requiring
information from the first-level buyer to be attached to the Sales Report, if available, and requiring first-level
buyers to make records of their transactions involving management unit species available to authorized officials.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The measures establishing framework procedures for the review and possible change of the target level of the CPUE
in the model used to calculate the annual quota and to allow fishing under some circumstances when the initial quota
is zero (numbers 2 and 3 above) have been disapproved by NMFS. These two measures are neither necessary nor appropriate
for conservation and management of the fishery as required by section 303(a)(1)(A) of the Magnuson Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There has been a substantial decrease in recruitment to the lobster fishery. This, the total closure of the fishery
during the 1993 season, and the great difference between the initial quota and the final quota during the 1994 season
has prompted a complete review of the model used to determine the annual quotas and the quota system in general. For
this reason, the provision allowing changes in the target CPUE pursuant to framework procedures is premature. Any
change in the model should be postponed until an analysis of the model is available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purposes of the framework procedure under which fishing might be allowed when the initial quota is zero are to obtain
fisheries data or to relieve economic hardship. The proposal to consider allowing fishing to relieve economic hardship
is ambiguous because the term ``economic hardship'' is not defined. Without defining the term, it is unclear how and
when allowing fishing would be considered and how it would meet the goals of the FMP. Allowing fishing to collect data
duplicates section 681.26 of the implementing regulations regarding experimental fishing. Issuing experimental
fishing permits is an effective way of allowing fishing that ordinarily would not be permitted so that fisheries data
can be collected. The other provisions of Amendment 8 have been approved.

Comment and Response 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Only one comment was received on the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One individual commented that eliminating the landing requirement gives the resource in perpetuity to those who
currently hold permits. He felt the point system for new entry should be maintained. The holders of these permits may
or may not view the fishery as a long-term trust. This commenter also indicated it was a mistake to allow the transfer
of permits given that carrying capacity now exceeds the capacity of the resource. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The issues of maintaining the point system or not allowing the transfer of permits are not within the scope of Amendment
8. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nevertheless, the landing requirement, coupled with transferable limited entry permits, was intended to ensure
that there always would be sufficient capacity to harvest the optimum yield. The number of permitted vessels was based
on an assumption of stable recruitment and would provide the greatest economic return from the fishery. Presently,
productivity of the resource is low and the harvesting capacity of the fleet is greater than needed; however, the Council
did not propose changing the number of permits allowed in the fishery. There are numerous restrictions to protect
the resource, including size limits, a closed season, protection of berried females, and a quota based on productivity
of the resource. When productivity is low, the quota is low. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eliminating the landing requirement relieves vessel owners from fishing for lobster when investing fishing effort
would be poor business; therefore, an unforeseen and unintended economic burden will be removed. The point system
has not resulted in and would not be expected to result in new entry. Permits are transferable, and permit holders would
likely transfer permits rather than forfeit them. In addition, at low quota levels, there may be risks of overrunning
the quota before the fishery can be closed.

Changes From the Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The changes in the Quota Management Program (&sect;681.31) described in the proposed rule have not been approved;
therefore, those revisions have been dropped from the final rule and &sect;681.31 remains unchanged. Also in the
final rule, the definition of ``forecast quota'' is not added to replace the definition of ``initial quota'' because
this was intended to implement one of the disapproved measures. No other changes were made to the proposed rule.

This rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule contains collection-of-information requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act. The collection
of this information has been approved by the OMB under OMB Control Number 0648&hyph;0214. A notification requirement
before offloading of the catch is added. The existing sales report is modified by eliminating certain data elements.
First-level buyers can choose to submit a worksheet in lieu of allowing an authorized officer to access, inspect,
and copy records relating to their sales. The estimated total reporting burden (assuming that all 15 permit holders
will take 4 trips per year) is estimated at 5 minutes per response. This includes the time for reviewing instructions,
searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection
of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information,
including suggestions for reducing this burden, to NMFS and OMB (see

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule implements certain provisions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, as further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended by subsequent 1988, 1989, and 1990 legislation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These provisions make significant changes in the process of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveying skilled nursing facilities under Medicare and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nursing facilities under Medicaid and in the process for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certifying that these facilities meet the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for participation in the Medicare and Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. They also set forth a number of alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies which may be imposed on facilities that do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comply with the Federal participation requirements (instead 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of or in addition to termination), and specify remedies for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State survey agencies that do not meet surveying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To participate in the Medicare or Medicaid programs, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
long-term care facilities must be certified as meeting Federal participation requirements. Long-term care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities include skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare and nursing facilities (NFs) for Medicaid. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal participation requirements for these facilities are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified in HCFA regulations at 42 CFR part 483, subparts A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1864(a) of the Social Security Act (the Act) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorizes the Secretary to enter into agreements with State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey agencies to determine whether SNFs meet the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation requirements for Medicare. Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1902(a)(33)(B) of the Act provides for State survey agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to perform the same survey tasks for facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participating or seeking to participate in the Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program. The results of Medicare and Medicaid related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveys are used by HCFA and the Medicaid State agency, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respectively, as the basis for a decision to enter into, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deny, or terminate a provider agreement with the facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assess compliance with Federal participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements, surveyors conduct onsite inspections (surveys) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of facilities. In the survey process surveyors directly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
observe the actual provision of care and services to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residents and the effect or possible effects of that care to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assess whether the care provided meets the assessed needs of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual residents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SNFs that are approved for participation in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare program also meet the participation requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the Medicaid program. However, the Medicaid State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency is not obligated to enter into a Medicaid provider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement with a facility just because the Secretary has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entered into a Medicare provider agreement with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility. Additionally, if a State imposes Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements that exceed those of Medicare, section 1863 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act provides that the higher requirements must be met by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Medicare SNFs in that State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before the 1987 legislation, the only adverse actions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available to HCFA and the States against facilities that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were determined to be out of compliance with Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation requirements included termination, nonrenewal, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or automatic cancellation of provider agreements; denial of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation for prospective facilities; and denial of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment for new admissions in lieu of termination when the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities had deficiencies that did not pose an immediate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and serious threat to the health and safety of residents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(The denial of payment action has been considered an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``alternative'' sanction because it is an alternative to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
termination.)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
'87), Public Law 100&hyph;203, enacted on December 22, 1987, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended the Act to incorporate specific provisions for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nursing home reform. These provisions included specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised requirements for the survey and certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process (section 4202 for Medicare and section 4212 for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid) and for the enforcement process (sections 4203 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4213). Sections 4202 and 4212 of OBRA '87 added new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sections 1819(g) and 1919(g) to the Act to revise and expand 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare and Medicaid provisions, respectively, on State and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal responsibilities for survey and certification, types 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of and requirements for surveys, survey team composition and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibilities, requirements for validation surveys, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures for investigating complaints and monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance, disclosure of results of inspections and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities, and provisions for penalties imposed on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States for failure to comply with survey process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. Sections 4203 and 4213 of OBRA '87 added 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sections 1819(h) and 1919(h) to the Act to specify the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare and Medicaid enforcement process, respectively, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified remedies for noncompliance to be used in lieu of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or in addition to termination of facilities' participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the programs. Section 411 of the Medicare Catastrophic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Coverage Act of 1988 (MCCA), Public Law 100&hyph;360, enacted on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
July 1, 1988, also included a number of technical and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correcting amendments affecting these OBRA '87 provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These changes will be discussed in detail later in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preamble. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 28, 1992, we published a proposed rule in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (57 FR 39278) setting forth our proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for altering the requirements for surveying facilities and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expanding the choice of alternative remedies for HCFA and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Medicaid State agency to apply in lieu of or in addition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to termination of facilities that do not comply with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation requirements. In the proposed rule we said 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that our goal is to promote facility compliance by ensuring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that all deficient providers are appropriately sanctioned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Termination is still possible any time a facility is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified as having deficiencies, and if a facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continues to have deficiencies after a specified period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time, the law requires that Federal payments for services in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that facility cease at that time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the proposed rule we indicated that we are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementing the Congress' mandate, as indicated in OBRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
'87, to abandon our traditional hierarchical requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system and develop a system capable of detecting and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responding to noncompliance with any requirement. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system we proposed was built on the assumption that all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements must be met and enforced and that requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
take on greater or lesser significance as a function of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances and resident outcomes in a particular facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the time of survey. The surveyors will determine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existence or nonexistence of immediate and serious threat to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residents as well as the severity and scope of a deficiency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to arrive at a conclusion as to the seriousness of that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiency in that facility. The proposed regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporated scope and severity surveyor guides for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining the remedy or remedies to apply. We also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed that the selection of a particular remedy be based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the nature of the deficiencies and the remedy (or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies) that either HCFA or the Medicaid State agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes is most likely to achieve correction of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies. As we stated in the proposed rule, we believe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that remedies applied in the manner described within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulations will deter violations as well as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
encourage immediate response and sustained compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The new system also proposed changes in the enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority for dually participating (Medicare and Medicaid) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities. OBRA '89 provided the basis for decisions as to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether the State's or the Secretary's determination of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance or noncompliance or choice of remedies is binding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the case of a dually participating facility. Moreover, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the statute at section 1919(h)(8), provides that whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification decisions and enforcement actions, as applied 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to Medicaid, are those of the Secretary or the State, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same certification decision and enforcement actions will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also apply to Medicare in a dually participating facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the statute specifies whether the Secretary's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or State's certification decision and enforcement remedies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will prevail in the case of Federal validation surveys. Our 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
August 28, 1992 proposed rule reflected these changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Provisions of the Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the proposed rule published on August 28, 1992 in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, we proposed to implement the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of OBRA '87, as further amended by subsequent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1988, 1989, and 1990 legislation. The specific proposals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Routine Process of Certification and Enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. State-Operated Facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We proposed at &sect;488.155 and &sect;488.180 that in all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State-operated facilities, the State survey agency conduct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the survey, recommend to HCFA a certification of compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or noncompliance and recommend appropriate enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action(s). After the survey agency forwards its survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
findings and recommended certification and enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action(s) to HCFA, HCFA in turn would certify facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance or noncompliance and impose any enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action(s). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Non-State Operated Facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At &sect;&sect;488.155 and 488.180, we proposed the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;For non-State operated SNFs, to continue to use the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process in effect before October 1, 1990, whereby the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey agency conducts the survey and certifies compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or noncompliance with Federal requirements subject to HCFA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval. We also proposed that the survey agency recommend 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate remedies, and that, after the survey agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forwards its survey findings and recommended enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action(s) to HCFA for review, HCFA determines the compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or noncompliance of the facility and imposes any enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action(s). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;For non-State operated NFs, to continue to use the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process in effect before October 1, 1990, whereby the survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency conducts the survey, certifies compliance or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance with Federal requirements, and recommends 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate enforcement actions to HCFA and the Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State agency. The certification of compliance or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance by the State is final except in the case of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complaint or validation survey, or review of the State's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
findings by HCFA in which the Secretary substitutes her 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
judgment for that of the State. Except where the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intervenes, the State makes all enforcement decisions and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposes remedies after consideration of the survey findings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and recommended enforcement remedies. Regardless of which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency of the State exercises certification and enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority, however, we look to the Medicaid State agency to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assure compliance with Federal requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;For dually participating facilities, the survey agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would conduct the survey, certify compliance or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance with Federal requirements, and recommend 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate enforcement actions. The certification of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance or noncompliance and recommended enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action(s) by the State would be sent to both HCFA and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid State agency for review. In a new subpart F 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Remedies for Long-Term Care Facilities with Deficiencies), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we proposed to add a new &sect;488.234, to set forth procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for occasions when there are State and Federal disagreements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involving findings when there is no immediate and serious 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threat to the residents. We view section 1919(h)(8) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act as calling for the application of the decision for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid NFs to Medicare SNFs when a facility is dually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participating.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Validation Surveys and HCFA Oversight 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 1819(g)(3)(A) and 1919(g)(3)(A) of the Act direct the Secretary to conduct onsite surveys of a representative
sample of nursing homes within 2 months of the last day of survey when the Secretary is validating the State survey agency's
performance. If the State determines that the facility is in compliance, but the Secretary finds that the facility
is out of compliance, the Secretary's determination as to the facility's noncompliance is binding and supersedes
that resulting from the State survey as specified at &sect;488.234(a)(2) of our NPRM and section 1919(h)(6)(B) of
the Act. However, section 1919(h)(6)(A) specifies that when the State finds noncompliance and the Secretary makes
no such finding, the State's noncompliance decision and enforcement actions control. We incorporated this in &sect;488.234(a)(1)
of our proposed rule. At paragraph (a)(3) of &sect;488.234, we proposed that, when HCFA's survey findings take precedence,
HCFA could_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Impose any of the alternative remedies we specify in our proposed &sect;488.206 (Available remedies); or

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Permit payments to continue to the NF and dually participating facility if the applicable conditions at our
proposed &sect;488.232 (Continuation of payments to a facility with deficiencies) are satisfied. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
These provisions proposed to specify the means to determine compliance or noncompliance for the Medicaid NF which
would then become the compliance/noncompliance decision for the Medicare SNF. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In our proposed &sect;488.234(b), we stated that, if both the Secretary and the State disagree over the decision to
terminate a non-State operated NF or dually participating facility_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;HCFA's decision to terminate the participation of a facility takes precedence when_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;Both HCFA and the State find that the facility has not met all requirements; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;HCFA, but not the State, finds that the facility's participation should be terminated. We proposed that
HCFA would permit continuation of payment during the period prior to the effective date of termination not to exceed
6 months from the last day of the survey. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The State's decision to terminate a facility's participation and the timing of termination would take precedence
when_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;The State, but not HCFA, finds that a facility's participation should be terminated; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;The State's timing for the termination is for no later than 6 months after the last day of survey. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In paragraph (c) of the proposed &sect;488.234, we stated that when the State and HCFA disagree over timing of termination
of a facility, the State's timing takes precedence if it does not occur later than 6 months after the date of the finding
to terminate. Paragraph (d) stated that when there is overlap of State and HCFA remedies, the HCFA remedies apply,
and paragraph (e) stated that, regardless of whose decision controlled in paragraphs (b), (c), or (d), the compliance
and enforcement decision for the Medicaid agreement is binding on the Medicare agreement in the case of a dually participating
facility.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Hearings and Appeals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At &sect;488.180(e)(1), we proposed that the State must impose remedies on any Medicaid provider_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;When the State identifies violations of Federal requirements after notifying the provider of the deficiencies
and impending remedy; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Except for civil money penalties, during the pendency of any hearing that the provider may request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At &sect;488.180(e)(2), we proposed that appeal procedures under 42 CFR part 498 (Appeals Procedures for Determinations
that Affect Participation in the Medicare Program) apply when the provider requests a hearing on HCFA's denial of
participation, termination of provider agreement, or the Secretary's certification of noncompliance leading
to an enforcement remedy, except State monitoring, against all State-operated facilities, as a result of a HCFA validation
survey or HCFA's review of the State's survey findings and for non-State operated SNFs and dually participating facilities.
The State must impose the same remedy, which is also subject to these appeal procedures. At &sect;488.180(e)(3) of
our proposed rule, we proposed that the appeal procedures under 42 CFR part 431 (State Organization and General Administration)
apply in cases when the provider requests a hearing on the State's denial of participation, termination of provider
agreement, or certification of noncompliance leading to an alternative remedy against a non-State operated Medicaid
NF. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Prospective Providers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At &sect;488.180(f), we proposed that prospective providers applying to participate in the Medicare or Medicaid
(or both) programs meet all participation requirements as a precondition of their participation. As we explained
in the preamble of the proposed rule, we based this on various provisions of the Act and the legislative history and
on the overall structure of the Act which differs significantly from the one previously in effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Substandard Care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;488.151 (Definitions), we proposed defining substandard care as care furnished in a facility that has one
or more deficiencies in any area with a severity level of 3 or 4, regardless of scope; or a level 2 in severity with a level
3 or 4 in scope in quality of care requirements, as defined in &sect;483.25 (Quality of care). We described the levels
for severity and scope in detail under the section of the preamble entitled, ``Enforcement Options.'' That discussion
is summarized in section J.11 of this background statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Surveys 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 1819(g) (2) and (3) and 1919(g) (2) and (3) of the Act, as added by sections 4202 and 4212 of OBRA '87, specify
the requirements for types and periodicity of surveys that are to be conducted for each facility; including standard,
special, partial extended, extended, and validation surveys. These provisions include specific contents and procedures,
frequency, consistency, and team composition, and are intended to protect residents' rights, health and safety
and not unduly burden the facilities or the survey agencies. We proposed to set forth implementing regulations as
follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Standard Surveys 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At &sect;488.155, we proposed that, for each SNF and NF, the State survey agency must conduct standard surveys and
stated what they must include. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At &sect;488.158, we proposed to require each SNF and NF to be subject to a standard survey not later than 15 months after
the last day of the previous standard survey and that the statewide average intervals between standard surveys must
not exceed 12 months. We also specified when and how the average intervals would be computed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Special Surveys 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 1819(g)(2)(A)(iii) and 1919(g)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act, as added by OBRA '87, specify that a standard survey
or an abbreviated standard survey may be conducted within 2 months of any change of ownership, administration, management
of a facility, or director of nursing to determine whether the change has resulted in any decline in the quality of care
furnished by the facility. A survey conducted for the purpose of investigating a complaint against a facility is also
considered a special survey. An abbreviated standard survey is a partial survey that focuses on a specific participation
requirement or requirements. At paragraph (e) of &sect;488.158, we proposed that the decision of whether to conduct
a standard or an abbreviated standard survey under these circumstances be at a State survey agency's or the Secretary's
discretion, based on the individuals and facilities involved and the State's concern that the quality of care may
have declined.

Extended and Partial Extended Surveys 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with Sections 1819(g)(2)(B) and 1919 (g)(2)(B) of the Act, we proposed to require that, during an extended
survey, the survey team must review and identify the policies and procedures for those provisions of the regulations
that produced the substandard quality of care and must determine whether a facility complies with all requirements
of participation. The extended survey must also include an expansion of the size of the sample of residents' assessments
reviewed, a review of the staffing levels and staff inservice training, and, if appropriate, an examination of contracts
with consultants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These provisions were incorporated in the proposed rule at &sect;488.160 (Extended survey). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Validation Surveys 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We proposed that the validation surveys must be conducted within 2 months of the date of the State's surveys and must
be of sufficient number to allow inferences about the adequacy of the State's surveys. In addition, the Act requires
us to conduct validation surveys in at least 5 percent of the SNFs and NFs surveyed by each State during the year but in
no case less than 5 facilities in each State. The same protocol used for the standard or extended survey must be used
for the validation survey. We proposed to incorporate these requirements in paragraph (a) of &sect;488.166 (Validation
surveys). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the proposed rule, we dealt with four other survey-related issues: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Composition of Survey Teams 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At &sect;488.164, we proposed that_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Surveys must be conducted by a multidisciplinary team of professionals, which must include a registered nurse.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_A surveyor is disqualified for surveying a particular facility if he or she currently serves or, within the previous
2 years has served as a member of the staff of, or as a consultant to that facility, or if a member of his or her immediate
family has any financial interest or any direct or indirect ownership interest in that facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Surveyors must receive comprehensive training, including the application and interpretation of regulations for
SNFs and NFs, techniques and survey procedures for conducting standard and extended surveys; and techniques and
survey procedures for auditing resident assessments and plans of care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistency of Surveys 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations at &sect;488.162 specify that the State must conduct ongoing studies and analyses, and/or
implement new programs to measure and improve consistency in survey results, such as validation of surveyor findings,
and the application of enforcement remedies. The proposed regulations also specified that HCFA will perform the
same tasks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Unannounced Surveys 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While sections 1819(g)(2)(A)(i) and 1919(g)(2)(A)(i) of the Act specifically require unannounced standard surveys,
we proposed that all surveys, whether abbreviated, extended, follow-up, validation or otherwise, be unannounced
and incorporated this provision in the proposed regulations at &sect;488.157. When a survey agency is found to have
notified a SNF or NF through its scheduling or procedural policies, we are authorized to apply appropriate sanctions
for inadequate survey performance specified at the proposed &sect;488.170 and described immediately below under
the section entitled, ``Inadequate Survey Performance.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Inadequate Survey Performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If we find, as a result of the validation surveys, that the State has failed to perform the standard and extended surveys
properly or that the State's performance is otherwise inadequate, we are authorized to apply an appropriate sanction
for inadequate survey performance. Section 1819(g)(3)(C) of the Act requires the Secretary to provide an appropriate
remedy (which may include training) when the State has failed to perform surveys required under the Act or when the
Secretary has decided survey performance is not otherwise adequate. At &sect;488.170, we proposed the following
remedies to be applied as appropriate: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;For Medicaid facilities HCFA will_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;Reduce FFP and if appropriate, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;Provide for training of survey teams. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;For Medicare facilities HCFA will_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;Specify the inadequacy to the survey agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;Require a plan of correction; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;Provide for training of survey teams; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;Provide technical assistance on scheduling and procedural policies; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;Provide HCFA-directed scheduling; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;Initiate action to terminate the agreement between the Secretary and the State under section 1864 of the
Act, either in whole or in part.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;488.151, we proposed to define ``abuse'' as physical, psychological, or verbal interaction with a facility
resident, including, but not limited to, ill treatment, physical violation, and/or other disregard of an individual
which could cause or result in mild to severe, temporary or permanent mental or physical injury, harm, or, ultimately,
death. ``Neglect'' would mean a failure, through inattentiveness, carelessness, or omission, of an individual,
to provide timely, consistent and safe services, treatment, and care to a facility resident. ``Misappropriation
of resident property'' would mean the deliberate misplacement, exploitation, or wrongful, temporary, or permanent
taking or use of a facility resident's belongings or money, or both, without the resident's consent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 1819(g)(1)(C) and 1919(g)(1)(C) of the Act, as added by OBRA '87 and amended by section 411(a)(5)(C) of Public
Law 100&hyph;360 (MCCA), require the State, through the agency responsible for surveys and certification of nursing
facilities, to develop a process for the receipt and timely review and investigation of allegations of neglect and
abuse and misappropriation of resident property by a nurse aide of a facility or by another individual used by the facility
in providing services to residents. These sections also provide, after notification of the allegations, for the
State to provide the opportunity for a hearing to the individual against whom an allegation has been made; and if the
allegations are confirmed, for the State to notify the individual, the nurse aide registry, and the appropriate licensure
authorities if applicable. In &sect;488.185 (Action on complaints of neglect, abuse, and misappropriation of property),
we proposed regulations that would implement these provisions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;488.182 (Investigation of complaints of violations: Investigations and monitoring), we proposed that
the survey agency be required to conduct surveys as frequently as necessary to ascertain compliance with the Federal
requirements of participation or to confirm the correction of deficiencies under the cited circumstances. The proposed
regulations would also incorporate the provisions of sections 1819(g)(4) and 1919(g)(4) of the Act that a State may
maintain and use a specialized team to identify, survey, gather, and preserve evidence and to administer appropriate
enforcement remedies against substandard facilities.

I. Disclosure of Survey Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At &sect;488.175 (Disclosure of survey information), we proposed regulations to implement sections 1819(g)(5)
and 1919(g)(5) of the Act, as added by OBRA '87. We proposed at &sect;488.175 to accept oral as well as written requests
for information and to charge the public for the cost of retrieval, reproduction, and mailing information in accordance
with regulations under the Freedom of Information/Privacy Act. The disclosing entity (HCFA, the survey agency,
or the Medicaid State agency) would respond within 10 days with the requested information, if releasable and already
available, or with an interim response explaining whether the information is releasable and when it will be available
for release. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OBRA '90 specified which information is releasable and when it is available for release. Sections 1819(g)(5)(A)
and 1919(g)(5)(A) of the Act provide that each State, and the Secretary, shall make available to the public information
concerning all surveys and certifications of NFs and SNFs, including statements of deficiencies, within 14 calendar
days after such information is made available to those facilities, and approved plans of correction. We proposed
to implement this provision at &sect;488.175(d)(3).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 1819(g)(5)(B) and 1919(g)(5)(B) of the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require State survey agencies to notify the State's long-term care ombudsman of any adverse actions imposed against
a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility. We proposed at 488.175(e) that the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey agency be required to provide the State's long-term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
care ombudsman with the report of noncompliance of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility, report of any adverse actions imposed, any written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
response by the SNF or NF, and the results of any appeals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of sections 4008(h)(2)(E) and 4801(e)(5)(D) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of OBRA '90, sections 1819(b)(4)(C)(ii)(IV) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1919(b)(4)(C)(ii)(IV) of the Act require the Secretary and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State, respectively, to provide notice to the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
long-term care ombudsman and the State protection and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advocacy system for the mentally ill and mentally retarded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of SNF and NF waivers. Sections 1819(b)(4)(C)(ii)(V) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1919(b)(4)(C)(ii)(V), as added by OBRA '90, require the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility receiving such nursing waivers to notify the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residents of the facility (or, when appropriate, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guardians or legal representatives of such residents) and a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resident's immediate family of the waiver. We proposed, at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 488.175 (f) and (g), that facilities give this notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within 10 days from the date the SNF or NF is granted the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waiver. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under sections 1819(g)(5)(C) and 1919(g)(5)(C) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act, the State is required to notify each attending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physician and the State board responsible for licensing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nursing home administrators when a facility has provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substandard quality of care. We proposed requiring each SNF 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or NF to provide either HCFA or the State, no later than 10 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
days after receiving a notice of substandard care, with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
list of each Medicare and Medicaid resident in the facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the name and address of his or her attending physician. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also proposed at &sect;488.175 requiring the State to notify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the attending physicians and the State licensing board 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within 30 days of the date the SNF or NF is notified of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finding of substandard care. We recognized that this and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the notification requirement related to nurse waivers were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the only provisions in our proposed regulation which set 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forth requirements for nursing homes. All other provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the proposed rule set forth requirements for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary and the State in the enforcement of nursing homes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. We included these facility requirements in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed rule because they directly or indirectly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pertain to the enforcement process. The same sections of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act also required the State survey agency to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
access to any information incidental to a facility's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation in Medicare or Medicaid upon request by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State Medicaid fraud control unit established under 42 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part 1002, subpart C. We proposed incorporating this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision under paragraph (j) of &sect;488.175.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Overview 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated earlier, before the passage of OBRA '87, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only adverse actions available to HCFA and the States for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposition against long term care facilities that were out 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of compliance with Federal requirements were termination of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation, nonrenewal and automatic cancellation, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
denial of participation for prospective providers. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, HCFA and the States had authority, in cases of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
long-term care facilities, to deny payment for new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
admissions to facilities rather than to terminate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provider agreements when deficiencies did not present an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediate and serious threat to the health and safety of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residents of the facilities. The denial of payment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision was considered both an alternative to the more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
severe measures, as well as an intermediate step that HCFA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or the State could take prior to and possibly in lieu of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
termination from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanction afforded HCFA and the States the opportunity to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defer the decision to terminate. Thus, the terms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``alternative sanction'' and ``intermediate sanction'' came into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use to designate denial of payment for new admissions to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities for a period of up to 11 months after the month 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in which the sanction was imposed. Former sections 1866(f) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 1902(i) of the Act were the authority for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative sanction under Medicare and Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respectively. The Family Support Act of 1988, Public Law 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
100&hyph;345, repealed the Medicare provision and MCCA made the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid provision applicable only to ICFs/MR.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OBRA '87 included revised and expanded authority for enforcement of the Federal participation requirements for
long-term care facilities. We proposed adding a new subpart, subpart F (Remedies for Long Term Care Facilities with
Deficiencies) to part 488 to implement these new provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Determination of Deficiencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Effective October 1, 1990, providers of nursing services participating in the Medicare or Medicaid programs were
subject to the requirements of participation that were published on February 2, 1989 (54 FR 5316). These requirements
focus more sharply on the resident care practices and outcomes, and facility practices with respect to resident rights.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the proposed rule we explained that the collective exercise of surveyor judgments, which has always been the vehicle
for the identification of deficiencies would remain unchanged. For this reason, we concluded that there was no more
reason to have specific regulations governing this process than there had been in the past. Thus, we proposed that,
surveyors would gather information based upon direct observations, record review, and interviews with residents,
staff, and family members. Based on their collection of information, they would collectively compile and analyze
it, and match the data to the legal standards facilities are obliged to meet to determine if deficiencies exist. As
is true now, these conclusions would be based upon single observations or groups of observations, either one of which
may sustain a finding that a requirement has not been met. We proposed that once the survey team made its judgments about
whether the facts supported a conclusion that deficiencies exist, it would be the team's responsibility to assess
the scope and severity of those deficiencies (in the manner described later in this preamble) in order to recommend
one or more remedies to either HCFA or the Medicaid State agency for the enforcement of the requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Remedies To Be Imposed as Alternative or Intermediate Sanctions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with sections 1819(h) and 1919(h) of the Act as added by OBRA '87, we proposed to add a new &sect;488.206,
listing the available remedies. It stated that, in addition to termination of the provider agreement, the following
remedies would be available: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Temporary management; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Denial of payment including_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;Denial of payment for all new admissions; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;Denial of payment for all new admissions in certain diagnostic categories or requiring specialized care;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;Denial of all payment (to be imposed only by HCFA) to facilities, for Medicare and to States, for Medicaid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Directed plan of corrections; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;State monitoring; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Civil money penalties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 488.206 also proposed other remedies for non-State-operated Medicaid-only and dually participating facilities.
They were: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Closure of the facility and transfer of residents; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Additional or alternative State remedies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, we proposed at &sect;488.153 that, if a State wishes to use additional or alternative remedies, it must specify
those remedies in the State plan, and demonstrate to HCFA's satisfaction that those remedies are as effective as those
set forth in the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At &sect;488.208, we set forth proposed rules governing the choice of remedies. We said that the survey agency or HCFA
would assess individual deficiencies or clusters of deficiencies first according to the presence or absence of immediate
and serious threat to resident health and safety, the severity of the deficiency, and the scope of the deficiency.
We proposed that, following the initial assessment, HCFA and the survey agency may consider the following secondary
factors: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The relationship of one deficiency or group (cluster) of deficiencies to other deficiencies; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The facility's prior compliance history in general and specifically with reference to the cited deficiencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We said that the selection of a remedy would be based on the nature of the deficiencies or cluster of deficiencies. Proposed
&sect;&sect;488.210 and 488.212 set forth the rules for imposition of particular remedies in specified circumstances.
We said that, regardless of which remedy or remedies are imposed, each facility that is out of compliance with a program
requirement would be required to submit a plan of correction for approval by HCFA or the survey agency, except in the
case of deficiencies that HCFA or the State determines to be at a scope and severity level of 1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The choice of remedy, by either HCFA or the State, including the manner in which HCFA or the State uses the scope and severity
scales specified in &sect;488.204 would not be subject to review as part of the appeals process set forth in part 431
or part 498.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Temporary Management as a Remedy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When alternative remedies are imposed instead of termination to bring a facility into compliance with program requirements
in an immediate and serious threat situation, temporary management would always be imposed immediately to remove
the threat to residents in accordance with sections 1819(h)(2)(A)(i), 1919(h)(1)(A), and 1919(h)(3)(B)(i) of
the Act. We proposed that temporary management also be available in addition to termination in an immediate and serious
threat situation while there is an orderly termination or closure of the facility. In situations where deficiencies
do not constitute an immediate and serious threat, HCFA or the State also may appoint a temporary manager to substitute
as a manager or administrator. (Other remedies in addition to temporary management may also be imposed in the case
of immediate and serious threat situations.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The temporary manager would have the authority to hire, terminate and reassign staff, obligate facility funds, alter
facility procedures as appropriate, or otherwise manage the facility as necessary to correct deficiencies identified
in the facility's operation. The temporary manager would be required to be a licensed nursing home administrator
within the State or have a reciprocal agreement with the State in which he or she is to serve, demonstrate prior competence
as a nursing home administrator, and have had no disciplinary action taken against him or her by any licensing board
of any State or by any professional society in the past 5 years. We proposed as well that neither the temporary manager
nor his or her immediate family could have a financial or ownership interest in the facility. The temporary manager's
salary would be paid by the facility. We proposed that the salary for the temporary manager may not exceed an amount
equivalent to the prevailing salary paid by providers in the geographic area for positions of this type, additional
costs that would have reasonably been incurred by the provider if such person had been in an employment relationship,
and any other costs incurred by such a person in furnishing services under such an arrangement (for example, travel
allowance) or as otherwise set by the State.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We proposed that termination would be imposed if the facility does not agree to this remedy or refuses to relinquish
authority to the temporary manager. In addition, if, despite the appointment of a temporary manager, the immediate
and serious threat is not removed within 23 days of the appointment of the temporary manager or if non-immediate and
serious threat deficiencies are not corrected within 6 months from the last day of survey, the facility's participation

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We proposed incorporating the above provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding temporary management in &sect;&sect;488.206, 488.210, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
488.215. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Denial of Payment for New Admissions As a Remedy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We proposed that a new &sect;488.217 be added to part 488 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to set forth denial for payment for all new admissions as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanction as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;For all new admissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_HCFA or the State may deny payment for new admissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, HCFA will and the State must deny payment for new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
admissions if_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;Any deficiency remains uncorrected within 90 calendar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
days after the last day of survey identifying the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;The survey agency has cited a facility with substandard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality of care on the last 3 consecutive standard surveys. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_If the facility achieves compliance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements, HCFA does or the State must resume payments to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the facility prospectively from the date that it determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that compliance has been achieved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Denial of payment for new admissions in certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diagnostic categories or requiring specialized care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_HCFA or the State may deny payment for new admissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who have certain specified diagnoses or special care needs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when HCFA or the State finds that_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;The facility is not currently able to provide care for these individuals; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;Caring for these individuals will adversely affect care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided to other residents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_If the facility achieves compliance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements, HCFA does or the State must resume payment to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the facility prospectively from the date that it determines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that compliance has been achieved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Directed Plan of Correction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 1819(h)(2)(B) and 1919(h)(2)(A) permit the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary and the State, respectively, to provide for other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified remedies. At &sect;488.224, we proposed adding a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directed plan of correction as a remedy in which a facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could be required to take action within specified timeframes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
according to the plan of correction developed by HCFA, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey agency, or the temporary manager (with HCFA or survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency approval). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The directed plans of correction would set forth the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected correction actions which the facility must take to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieve compliance and the dates by which the actions must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Use of State Monitoring As a Remedy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;&sect;488.206 and 488.222, we proposed that, if State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring is used as a remedy, State monitors would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to be onsite as frequently as necessary to oversee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the correction of specific deficiencies cited. This remedy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
differs from traditional revisits by the survey agency in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that State monitors are onsite, as necessary, while 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrections are being made, as opposed to a revisit which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurs after corrections are completed, and serve to confirm 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the deficiency has been removed. We said that State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring must be used as a remedy when a survey agency has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cited a facility with substandard quality of care on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
last three consecutive standard surveys. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We proposed that individuals serving as State monitors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be required to be employees or contractors of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State survey agency, and maintain professional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualifications needed to address the specific nature of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies. The State would be responsible for ensuring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the monitors are appropriate health care professionals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A State monitor could not function as a consultant to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility nor could the State monitor be an employee of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility. We concluded that a monitor serving as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consultant to a facility would potentially put the State in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a situation of defending the monitor's recommendations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rather than making the facility responsible for correcting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its deficiencies. Additionally, a monitor employed by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility and working for the State would constitute a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conflict of interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
8. Civil Money Penalties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At &sect;488.230, we proposed allowing civil money 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalties to be imposed for noncompliance regardless of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether or not the deficiencies constitute immediate and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
serious threat to resident health and safety. However, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed at &sect;488.230(b) that civil money penalties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not be imposed during the pendency of a hearing on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposition of that remedy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We proposed that, if HCFA wants to impose a civil money 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty, it must notify the provider in writing of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intent to impose a penalty. The notice would include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference to the statutory basis for the penalty, the amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the penalty per day of noncompliance, any circumstances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that were considered when determining the amount per day of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed penalty, and instructions for responding to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice, including a specific statement of the facility's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
right to a hearing and implications of waiving a hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the State proposes to impose a civil money penalty, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State would notify the facility in accordance with State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We proposed that a penalty amount would be permitted to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be imposed within the following ranges: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;For deficiencies constituting an immediate and serious 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threat (that is, a severity level of 4, regardless of scope)_$3,050 to $10,000 per day; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;For deficiencies constituting nonimmediate and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonserious threat above a scope or severity level of 1_$50 to $3,000 per day. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;For both levels, the amount of the civil money penalty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be set at $50 increments within these ranges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Removal of the immediate and serious threat, but not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the deficiencies, would justify the shift to the range of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalties that are imposed for nonimmediate and nonserious 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threat above a scope or severity level of 1. A penalty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be imposed at the immediate and serious level for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of days the immediate and serious threat is present. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We proposed that a provider may, in lieu of contesting the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiency which led to the imposition of the civil money 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty, waive the right to a hearing within the specified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
timeframes and procedures in the regulations under &sect;498.40 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Request for hearing) for Medicare and &sect;431.221 (Request 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for hearing) for Medicaid. If the facility were to waive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the right to a hearing within 60 days from the date of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice, HCFA or the State would be required to reduce the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
civil money penalty by 35 percent. If the facility were to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waive the right to a hearing after the 60th day, HCFA's or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State's settlement would be discretionary. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction in the civil money penalty would reflect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
savings to both the government and the provider of costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that would otherwise be incurred to formally adjudicate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dispute. The provider would be free to reject the option to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waive the right to a hearing. We proposed that the daily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fine amount of a facility could be increased if the facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alleges compliance, but on a revisit by HCFA or the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey agency, the facility is still found to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliant with the same requirements. The purpose of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
giving HCFA or the State discretion to increase the daily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fine, we believe, would be to deter unfounded allegations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance. The amount of increase, if any, would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective the day following the resurvey. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In determining the amount of the penalty, section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1128A(d) of the Act requires the Secretary to consider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific matters and also provides authority to take into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
account any other items relevant to the penalty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination. We proposed that the Secretary's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nondiscretionary and discretionary requirements be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to the State as well to make the Medicare and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid requirements equivalent for SNFs and NFs. We do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not believe that the Congress intended to have two separate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment methodologies in place between both enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorities when a civil money penalty from each could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potentially be imposed on a single facility. Our proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included two additional factors so that the noncompliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
itself is considered when determining the penalty amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining the amount of the penalty, we proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at &sect;488.230(g) that HCFA or the State must take into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
account the following factors: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The facility's degree of culpability; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The facility's history of prior offenses, including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repeat deficiencies; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The facility's financial condition; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The nature, scope, severity and duration of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The category of requirement with which the facility is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
out of compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The effective date for a civil money penalty would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 10th day after the last day of the survey in the case of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediate and serious threat deficiencies; or the 20th day 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after the last day of survey in the case of non-immediate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and non-serious threat deficiencies. These timeframes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit time to notify the facility of the intent to impose a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
civil money penalty 5 days after the last day of survey. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When HCFA's or the State's imposition of a civil money 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty is upheld on appeal or the facility waives its right 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to a hearing, we proposed that the civil money penalty would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be for the number of days between the effective date of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty and the date of correction of deficiencies, or, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable, the effective date of termination. Penalties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be computed after compliance is verified or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility has been sent notice of termination and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective date. In the case of the facility achieving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance, HCFA or the State would send a separate notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the facility containing the amount of penalty per day, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the number of days involved, the due date of the penalty, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the total amount due. In the case of a facility to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminated, HCFA or the State would send this penalty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information in the termination notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The daily accrual of civil money penalties would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposed for no longer than 6 months for non-immediate and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-serious threat deficiencies after which HCFA would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminate a SNF provider agreement, or stop Federal funding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the State for a NF, and the State may terminate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provider agreement of the NF if deficiencies remain. In the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
case of immediate and serious threat deficiencies, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
daily accrual of civil money penalties would continue until 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA or the State terminates the provider agreement or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies are corrected. If the facility can supply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documentation acceptable to HCFA or the State survey agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that compliance with participation requirements was attained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on a date preceding that of the revisit, fines would only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accrue until that date.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Payments for civil money penalties would be due 15 days 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Compliance is verified, if a hearing decision upholding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the imposition of the penalty had been rendered before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance had been verified, or the 60-day period for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requesting a hearing has expired and the facility has not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested a hearing or has waived its right to a hearing; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A hearing decision upholding the imposition of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty if compliance was achieved before the hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The effective date of termination if compliance has not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been achieved by that time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, &sect;431.153 (Evidentiary hearing) does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specify the number of days a facility has to request a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing. We proposed amending &sect;431.153 to add a new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (b) which specifies that a NF or ICF/MR must file 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a request for hearing within 60 days of receipt of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice of denial, termination, nonrenewal, or imposition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a civil money penalty or other remedies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with the way other civil money penalties are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovered, as provided in section 1128A(f) of the Act, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed that the amount of any penalty, when determined, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be deducted from any sum then or later owing by HCFA or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State to the facility against whom the penalty has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessed. Interest would be assessed on the unpaid balance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the penalty beginning on the due date. We proposed that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the rate of interest to be assessed on the unpaid balance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be negotiable and for that reason might vary on a case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by case basis. Funds collected by HCFA or the State as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result of a civil money penalty would be returned to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare Trust Fund or to the State, respectively. Civil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
money penalties collected from dually participating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities would be returned to the Medicare Trust Fund and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State in proportion commensurate with the relative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proportions of the number of Medicare and Medicaid beds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actually in use at the facility at the time the facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receives notice of the imposition of the civil money 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty. Under section 1919(h)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act, funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collected by a Medicaid State agency must be put into a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
common fund to be applied to the protection of the health or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
property of residents of any NF that the State or HCFA finds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficient, including payment for the cost of relocating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residents to other facilities, maintenance of operation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility pending correction of deficiencies or closure, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reimbursement of residents for personal funds lost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Oversight of the collection and use of funds will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addressed through HCFA's State agency evaluation program now 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in place.

Section 1919(h)(2)(A) allows the State to develop alternative or additional State remedies (other than denial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of payment for new admissions and State monitoring). At 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.228 (Alternative or additional State remedies), we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed that for Medicaid facilities, the State may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish and impose alternative remedies if the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrates to HCFA's satisfaction that the alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies are as effective in deterring noncompliance and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correcting deficiencies as the remedies of temporary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management, civil money penalties, and emergency closure of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the facility and transfer of residents. Regardless of which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative remedies the State establishes, we proposed that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they must include denial of payment for new admissions and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State monitoring as remedies. We reached this conclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because section 1919(h)(2)(D) of the Act requires that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
denial of payment for new admissions and State monitoring be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposed when a NF was found to have provided substandard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality of care on three consecutive standard surveys. We 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also required the State to include denial of payment for new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
admissions because section 1919(h)(2)(C) of the Act requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this remedy be imposed on a NF that has not complied with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the participation requirements within 3 months after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
last day of the survey which found the facility out of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with the requirements. We proposed requiring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that these alternative or additional remedies be approved by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA and specified in the State plan.

11. Selecting an Enforcement Remedy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Once a State or HCFA determines that violations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nursing home requirements have occurred, there is an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obligation to assess what the most effective remedy ought to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be to assure the protection of the well being of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resident population. At &sect;488.208 (Choice of remedies), we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed that the survey agency or HCFA assess individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies or clusters of deficiencies first according to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the following initial factors: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The presence or absence of immediate and serious threat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to resident health and safety; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The severity of the deficiency; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The scope of the deficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also proposed that, following the initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment, HCFA and survey agency could consider the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following secondary factors: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The relationship of one deficiency or group (cluster) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of deficiencies to other deficiencies; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The facility's prior compliance history in general and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically with reference to the cited deficiencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We said that the selection of a remedy would be based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the nature of the deficiencies or cluster of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies. In the proposed &sect;&sect;488.210 (Action when there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is immediate and serious threat) and 488.212 (Action when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there is no immediate and serious threat), we set forth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rules for the imposition of particular remedies in specified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances. Regardless of which remedy or remedies are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposed, each facility that is out of compliance with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program requirement must submit a plan of correction for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval by HCFA or the survey agency, except in the case of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies that HCFA or the State determines to be at a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scope and severity level of 1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We said that the choice of remedy, by either HCFA or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State, including the manner in which HCFA or the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uses the scope and severity scales specified in &sect;488.204 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Determination of remedies) would not be subject to review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as part of the appeals process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We set forth the proposed severity and scope scale in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.204 (Determination of remedies). We said that, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order to determine the seriousness of deficiencies, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey team would apply the following severity and scope 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scale guides: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Severity scale. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The four levels of the severity scale are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Level 1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any deficiency with respect to requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for long term care facilities that does not meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria for severity levels 2, 3, or 4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Level 2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Either a negative outcome or resident rights 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violation has occurred, or, in the survey team's judgment, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the ability of the individual to achieve the highest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practicable physical, mental, or psychosocial well-being has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been compromised, or both. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Level 3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Potential physical harm, which could cause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
serious harm, impairment or death. In the survey team's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
judgment, there is a recognizable health or safety hazard, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which if left unabated, is likely to cause serious harm, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impairment or death. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Level 4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Actual physical harm, which has caused 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
serious impairment or death. Life threatening harm, severe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impairment, or death has occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Scope scale. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The four levels of the scope scale are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Level 1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_Isolated. The survey team might conclude 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a deficiency is isolated if its perception is such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that, it believed the deficiency to exist only in a very 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited number of cases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Level 2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_Occasional. The survey team might conclude 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a deficiency is occasional if, in its combined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
judgment, the deficiency is identified in a number of cases, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but does not appear to reflect a pattern of facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
behavior. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Level 3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_Pattern. The survey team might conclude 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a pattern exists where, in its judgment, there are a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient number of repeated observations that it is likely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the deficiency might exist in cases not reviewed by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
team. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Level 4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_Widespread. The survey team might conclude 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a deficiency exists in sufficient number that, in its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
judgment, the deficiency represents a systemic or pervasive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practice of the facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
12. Application of Remedies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At &sect;488.210, we proposed that, if a determination has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been made that a deficiency would present an immediate and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
serious threat to resident health or safety, HCFA or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State would take immediate action to appoint a temporary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manager to remove the threat, impose other remedies as it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determines necessary to bring the facility into full 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance, and/or terminate the facility's participation in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the program within 23 calendar days of the last day of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey. If the facility does not accept temporary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management, HCFA or the State would immediately terminate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the provider agreement within 23 calendar days of the last 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
day of survey. If the facility accepts temporary management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but does not remove the immediate and serious threat within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
23 calendar days of the appointment of the temporary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manager, HCFA or the State would terminate the provider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement on the 23rd day from that appointment. The 5-calendar day period for providing notice to facilities of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
termination of a provider agreement as specified in &sect;489.53 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Termination by HCFA) of the regulations would be included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within this 23-day period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At &sect;488.212, we proposed that, if the facility is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found, at the time of the survey, to have deficiencies that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
do not pose an immediate and serious threat to resident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health and safety, HCFA or the State may allow the facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to continue to participate for up to 6 months from the date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the survey if_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The State finds that it is more appropriate to impose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative remedies than to terminate the facility; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The State survey agency has submitted a plan of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correction approved by HCFA; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The facility (in the case of a Medicare SNF or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State in the case of a Medicaid NF) agrees to repay to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal government payments received if corrective action is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not taken in accordance with the approved plan of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We said that, if a facility does not meet these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility criteria for continuation of payment, HCFA would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the State must terminate the facility's provider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement. If any deficiency at any severity or scope level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remained uncorrected within 90 calendar days after the last 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
day of survey, HCFA would and the State must deny payment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for new admissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We proposed that HCFA terminate provider agreements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SNFs and NFs, and stop FFP for NFs for which participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was continued, if cited deficiencies were not corrected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within 6 months of the last day of the survey. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the proposed rule, we also set forth specific rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on how to apply both low severity and scope levels and all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other severity and scope levels as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Low severity and scope levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_If both the severity level and the scope level are 1, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a deficiency still exists, but no alternative remedies are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposed or plan of correction required as long as correction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is achieved within 90 calendar days from the last day of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The survey agency would be required to give the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility a summary of the deficiencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_If the survey agency identifies a recurrence of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies at the next standard survey, HCFA or the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be required to impose one or more remedies specified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at &sect;488.206 (Available remedies) due to the persistence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the deficiencies over time.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_If the severity level is 1 and the scope is 2, 3, or

one or more of the remedies specified at &sect;488.206 paired 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with a plan of correction. The State would be required to

notify the attending physician of each resident to which

13. Procedures for the Imposition of Remedies Notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA or the State would give the facility notice of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intent to impose a remedy. At &sect;488.202(f), we proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that HCFA or the State give the facility notice of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedy at least 2 days but not more than 4 days before the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective date of the remedy in immediate jeopardy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situations, and at least 15 days before the effective date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the remedy when there is no immediate jeopardy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in practice, in immediate jeopardy situations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the remedy could be imposed anytime after the minimum 2 day 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notification period, but not later than the 10th day after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the last day of survey. This would allow up to 5 days for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA or the State to send the notice and an additional 2 to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4 days before the remedy is imposed.

14. Hearings: Medicare and Medicaid Consistency

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We proposed revising &sect;431.153 (Evidentiary hearing) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide that States must impose remedies, with the exception 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of civil money penalties, against providers of services at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the time that they identify the existence of violations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal requirements, notwithstanding any other provision of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State law. We intended that, under this provision, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanctions available under the program would become effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediately after the identification of program violations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and notification to the provider of the deficiencies and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impending sanction(s). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also proposed to delete &sect;442.40 (Availability of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FFP during appeals). This section has enabled States to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continue to receive FFP, under certain circumstances, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities whose provider agreement has been terminated, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
up to 120 days after the effective date of the termination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if a required administrative hearing decision has not been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reached. In light of our objective to be more aggressive in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the enforcement of nursing home requirements by requiring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that States provide only post-action hearings, just as is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
done under Medicare, we see &sect;442.40 as plainly inconsistent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with this objective.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At &sect;488.232, we proposed that HCFA may continue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments to a facility with deficiencies if the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria are met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The State finds that it is more appropriate to impose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative remedies than to terminate the facility; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The State has submitted a plan of correction approved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by HCFA; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The facility in the case of a Medicare SNF or the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the case of a Medicaid NF agrees to repay the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
government payments received if corrective action is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taken in accordance with the approved plan of correction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also proposed that HCFA or the State may terminate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the SNF or NF agreement before the end of the 6-month 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correction period if these criteria are not met. We said 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that, if any of these criteria are not met or agreed to by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either the State or the facility, the facility would receive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no Medicare or Federal Medicaid payments, as applicable, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the date of the determination of noncompliance by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either HCFA or the State.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the criteria are met, HCFA or the State may continue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments to a facility with deficiencies that do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constitute an immediate and serious threat for up to 6 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
months from the last day of the survey. If the facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not correct deficiencies by the end of the period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified, HCFA would_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Terminate the provider agreement for Medicare SNFs; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Discontinue FFP to the State for Medicaid NFs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State may terminate the provider agreement for NFs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We proposed that the required termination notice would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be sent 15 days before the end of the 6-month period, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the notice period would run concurrently with the last 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15 days of the 6-month period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare SNFs and dually participating facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adversely affected by the requirement to repay to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
government all payments received if corrective action is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taken could appeal the decision.

16. Resolution of Differences in Findings and Recommended Remedies Between State and HCFA for non-State operated

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid Facilities and Dually Participating Facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 1919(h) (6) and (7) of the Act set forth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
special rules for when the State and Secretary do not agree 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on findings of noncompliance, timing of termination or where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies overlap. To implement these provisions, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided in &sect;488.234 that, if HCFA finds that a non State-operated NF or a dually participating facility has
met all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements, but the State survey agency finds that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility has not met all requirements and the failure does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not immediately jeopardize the health and safety of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residents, the State survey agency's finding will control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(proposed &sect;488.234(a)(1)). In this instance the State's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification of noncompliance would control. The dually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participating facility would have its hearing rights met 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through the procedures set forth at 42 CFR part 498. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-State operated NF would have its hearing rights met 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through the procedures set forth at 42 CFR part 431. If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA finds that a NF or a dually participating facility has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not met all requirements and the failure does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediately jeopardize the health or safety of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residents, but the State survey agency has not made such a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finding, HFCA's finding could control. In this case, HCFA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would impose the remedies and would permit the State to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continue payments to the facility during the correction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period (proposed &sect;488.234(a) (2) and (3)). These provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specify the means to determine compliance or noncompliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the Medicaid NF which will then, by virtue of section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1919(h)(8) of the Act, become the compliance/noncompliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision for the Medicare SNF.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If both HCFA and the State find that a facility has not met all requirements and neither find that the failure immediately
jeopardizes the health or safety of its residents, the following procedures would apply: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If both HCFA and the State find that a facility's participation should be terminated, the State's timing of
any termination (as specified in proposed &sect;431.153(c)) would control so long as the termination date does not
occur later than 6 months after the date of the finding to terminate (&sect;488.234(b)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If HCFA, but not the State finds that a facility's participation should be terminated, HCFA's decision to terminate
would prevail and HCFA would permit continuation of payment during the period prior to the effective date of termination,
not to exceed 6 months from the last day of survey (&sect;488.234(b)(l)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If the State, but not HCFA finds that a facility's participation should be terminated, the State's decision
to terminate and the timing of the termination (as specified in proposed section 431.153(c)) would control (&sect;488.234(b)(2)).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If HCFA or the State, but not both, would impose one or more remedies that are additional or alternative to termination,
the additional or alternative remedies would also be applied (&sect;488.234(d)(l)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If both HFCA and the State would impose one or more remedies that are additional or alternative to termination,
only the additional or alternative remedies of HCFA would apply (&sect;488.234(d)(2)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
17. Termination of Provider Agreements and Discontinuation of FFP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At &sect;488.238, we said that termination of the provider agreement would end payment to the facility and any alternative
remedy. We proposed that HCFA and the State may terminate a facility's provider agreement if a facility_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Fails to correct deficiencies within the specified time; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Fails to submit a plan of correction within the time specified by HCFA; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Does not meet the eligibility criteria for continuation of payment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We said that HCFA and the State would terminate a facility's provider agreement if a facility with immediate and serious
threat deficiencies refuses temporary management, if that remedy is offered by HCFA or the Medicaid agency. In addition,
we proposed that, before terminating a provider agreement, HCFA does and the State must notify the facility and the
public_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;At least 2 and not more than 4 calendar days before termination for a facility with immediate and serious threat
deficiencies; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;At least 15 calendar days before termination for a facility with non-immediate and serious threat deficiencies.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current termination notification requirement at &sect;489.53(c)(1) requires HCFA to give notice to any provider
at least 15 days before the actual effective date of a termination of a provider agreement, irrespective of whether
the situation poses an immediate and serious threat, except in the case of Medicare SNFs. Section 489.53(c)(2) provides
that SNFs with deficiencies that pose an immediate and serious threat are entitled to notice of the termination at
least 2 days before the effective date of the termination of the provider agreement. Since the existing regulations
do not discriminate between immediate and serious and nonimmediate and serious threat situations except in the case
of Medicare SNFs, we proposed to amend &sect;489.53(c)(2) to require at least 2 and not more than 4 calendar days notice
to all providers of a termination action involving an immediate and serious threat.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If HCFA or the State terminates the provider agreement, we would require the survey agency to arrange for the orderly
transfer of all Medicare and Medicaid residents to another SNF or NF. If there is a closure of a Medicaid NF or dually
participating facility by the State, we proposed at &sect;488.240 that the State would be required to arrange for
an orderly transfer of all residents.

18. Conflict Resolution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the proposed rule, we sought public comment about the desirability and feasibility of establishing a conflict
resolution system whereby facilities dissatisfied with a certification of noncompliance would be afforded a formal
mechanism for disputing deficiencies prior to the administrative and judicial review processes. We also requested
comments on the best way for such a system to be implemented.

K. Incentives for High Quality Care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1919(h)(2)(F) of the Act, as added by section 4213 of OBRA '87, provides that, in addition to the remedies discussed,
a State may establish a program to reward, through public recognition, incentive payments, or both, nursing facilities
that provide the highest quality care to residents who are entitled to Medicaid. A State would incorporate such an
incentive program in its State plan. We proposed incorporating this provision in our proposed &sect;488.153(b).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
L. Educational Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 1819(g)(l)(B) and 1919(g)(1)(B) of the Act provide that each State must conduct periodic educational programs
for the staff and residents (and their representatives) of nursing homes in order to present current regulations,
procedures, and policies on the survey and certification and enforcement processes. We proposed incorporating
this provision in &sect;&sect;488.153(c) and 488.184. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
M. Conforming Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to changes already discussed in this preamble, we proposed making other conforming changes to regulations
under part 431, 442, and 489. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Summary of Major Provisions in Final Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to public comments, we made numerous technical changes and some major policy changes, which are explained
in detail in the following section. In summary, the major changes include the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We reconfigured the criteria used to determine enforcement remedies when facilities are out of compliance
with Federal requirements, so that there is a clearer correlation between levels of noncompliance and types of remedies
imposed. We have also grouped the remedies into three remedy categories ranging from least to most severe. In this
final rule, we present an enforcement scheme in which States may use their own methods for interpreting terms that
describe the relative frequency or seriousness of deficiencies, other than immediate jeopardy, as long as they are
consistent with the guidance presented in the regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We provide that remedies may cease when substantial compliance is achieved, and define substantial compliance
as ``a measure of compliance with the participation requirements such that no deficiencies exist which pose actual
harm or have the potential for more than minimal harm.'' The only exceptions to this rule are those involving temporary
management and State monitoring and denial of payment imposed for repeated noncompliance. In these cases, in addition
to achieving substantial compliance, the facility must prove to HCFA's or the State's satisfaction that it will remain
in substantial compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We also revise or add definitions for abuse, neglect, immediate jeopardy, substandard quality of care, standard
survey, validation survey, extended survey, partial extended survey, abbreviated standard survey, deficiency,
nursing facility, skilled nursing facility, substantial compliance, noncompliance and revisit.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;We clarify the term ``professionals'' as it relates to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the members of a survey team by setting forth examples and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by stating that the State, subject to HCFA approval, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determines what constitutes a ``professional.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We modify the qualifications for temporary managers and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
set a salary floor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We expand the financial, employment, and familial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances that disqualify a surveyor from surveying a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We limit the instances in which a reduction in FFP is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taken for inadequate survey performance to situations when a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State demonstrates a pattern of failure to identify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies in Medicaid facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We redefine what constitutes inadequate survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We amend the regulations text at &sect;488.312 (&sect;488.162 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the proposed rule), consistency of survey results, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require that State survey agencies study surveyor accuracy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as well as consistency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We clarify that the survey agency will review complaint 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allegations and conduct a standard or abbreviated standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
if
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the survey agency concludes that a deficiency in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one or more requirements may have occurred and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
only
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can confirm the existence of the deficiency or deficiencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We limit HCFA's and the State agency's discretion to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conduct an extended or partial extended survey to situations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in which substandard quality of care has been identified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA or the State will, however, continue to have complete 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discretion to examine any and all aspects of a facility's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance in order to determine compliance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We add directed in-service training as a new remedy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We expressly state that denial of all payment for all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare residents in a facility may be imposed by HCFA and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that HCFA may deny payment to the State for all Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residents in a facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We clarify that one or more remedies may be imposed for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one or more deficiencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We eliminate as a remedy denial of payment for certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diagnostic categories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We add the following to clarify the civil money penalty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;The amount of the civil money penalty can be adjusted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to reflect changes from non-immediate jeopardy to immediate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jeopardy and from immediate jeopardy to non-immediate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jeopardy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;A civil money penalty is increased for repeated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies within the same regulatory grouping of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements in those cases where a civil money penalty was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposed as a remedy for the first occurrence of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;The interest rate for civil money penalties is in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with the rate fixed by the Secretary of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Treasury and used by the Department for Medicare and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined by the State for Medicaid; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;The HCFA notice of the imposition of the civil money 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty does not have to be sent by mail; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;The HCFA notice of intent to impose the civil money 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty includes more information regarding the nature of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the noncompliance, dates of accrual and dates of collection; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;The State's notice to non-State operated NFs when the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State takes action must include at a minimum the information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified in the HCFA notice; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;If the facility waives its right to a hearing in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
writing within 60 days from the date of the notice of intent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to impose the civil money penalty, HCFA or the State reduces 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the civil money penalty by 35 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;The civil money penalty may start to accrue as early as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the date the facility was first found out of compliance, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined by HCFA or the State. This may be the last day 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the survey or, in certain situations, before that date.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;When the basis for imposing a civil money penalty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exists, the administrative law judge or State hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officer may not set a penalty of zero, reduce the penalty to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
zero, or review the exercise of discretion to impose the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
civil money penalty. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;In the case of civil money penalties, facilities may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
challenge the level of noncompliance found by HCFA or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State if a successful challenge on the issue would affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the range of civil money penalty amounts from which HCFA or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State could collect a civil money penalty. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We add a provision to direct the State during a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complaint investigation to follow the specific procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found at &sect;488.335 (&sect;488.185 of the proposed rule), action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on complaints of resident neglect and abuse, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misappropriation of resident property, when there is reason 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to believe that an identifiable individual neglected or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
abused a resident or misappropriated a resident's property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We add a requirement that the State must have written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures for the timely review and investigation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allegations of resident neglect and abuse and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misappropriation of resident property. In addition, we have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required that the State should take appropriate precautions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to protect a complainant's anonymity and privacy, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If arrangements have been made with other State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
components for investigation of complaints, we require that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State have a means of communicating information among 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate entities, and that the survey agency retain the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility for the investigation process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We require that findings of investigations be included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the nurse aide registry within 10 working days of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
findings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We require that the survey agency determine if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complaints violate any requirements of part 483, subpart B 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and take appropriate enforcement action as necessary if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allegation of neglect, abuse or misappropriation of property 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against an individual is a complaint against the facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We require the notification of physicians of those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residents identified as receiving substandard quality of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We clarify that survey findings are reported with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendations for corrective action to officials in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcing agency who determine what remedies to impose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;With respect to the disclosure of survey information, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we revise the provisions on fees, charges, and timeframes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for release of information to provide that, with certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceptions, HCFA or the State will disclose survey-related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information and may charge the public in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pre-existing Federal regulations and State procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We eliminate 120 days of FFP for a Medicaid NF and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retain, for now, 120 days of FFP for an ICF/MR while the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility waits for a post-termination hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We formalize the opportunity for informal dispute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resolution currently in the State Operations Manual for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providers to raise unresolved issues to the State agency or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the respective HCFA regional office after the provider's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

IV. Discussion of Public Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We received more than 27,900 timely letters in response to our August 28, 1992 proposed rule. Most were from the owners
and operators, administrators, staff, and attorneys of long term care facilities. Others were from professional
organizations, chains of long term care facilities, employee unions, and vendors that supply facilities. We also
heard from consumer advocates and ombudsmen, Federal, State, and local governments, consumer organizations, and
residents of long term care facilities. Families of residents and their guardians and other legal representatives
commented as well. A discussion of the comments follows. We do not discuss sections of the rule on which the public had
no comment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Normally, a final rule is not effective until 30 or 60 days after it is published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Because implementation of the complex and far-reaching provisions of this final rule will require a major, nationwide
training effort to train surveyors, their supervisors and related personnel, this rule is effective June 1, 1995.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter stated that HCFA must provide nursing homes with a reasonable education and retraining grace period
of no less than one year before implementing the new survey standards so that facilities can adjust to the enormous
changes. The States and HCFA should provide reasonable funding to ensure that training is completed before the new
requirements take effect. There is a precedent for this in HCFA's recent recognition that State certification requirements
for home health care aides should be accompanied by State funding to help facilitate retraining.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HCFA routinely provides a long lag time for the effective date of particularly complicated regulations and has done
so for this regulation as well. The new long term care requirements were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
on September 26, 1991 (56 FR 48826), and were effective April 1, 1992. This final enforcement rule should have no effect
on the requirements for long-term care as stated in the September 1991 regulation and the facilities should have had
ample time to become familiar with its requirements. Our primary concern is to provide oversight for the protection
of residents in nursing homes who are dependent upon others for the care they receive. It would serve no purpose to allow
facilities to have additional time to become familiar with requirements of which they are already aware. Our responsibility
is to continue to move forward in enacting the enforcement provisions for long term care facilities.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to our proposed revisions to part 431, most opposing comments concerned the effect on ICFs/MR of withdrawing
FFP during appeals. Some commenters noted that OBRA '87 specifically exempted ICFs/MR from its scope, and stated
that it is not appropriate to change the ICF/MR rules in implementing a law that applies to other facilities. Some commenters
stated that the discussion on ICFs/MR was lost within the SNF/NF regulations, and there was no discussion in the preamble
concerning applicability to ICFs/MR. Some stated that HCFA provided no rationale for this change in the ICF/MR rules,
and therefore a proposed rule should be published which allows for full notice and comment rulemaking. Some commented
that if the proposal had been written in a more direct manner, more groups would have written to object.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree that it would be preferable to include the provisions applicable to ICFs/MR at a later date in rulemaking focused
on ICFs/MR. Therefore, we are adopting the commenters' proposals that the 120 days of FFP continue for ICFs/MR until
this issue may be more fairly resolved in such a rulemaking. Therefore, at this time, we are leaving the existing appeals
system in place for ICFs/MR. There were other comments concerning ICFs/MR that are outside the purview of this regulation,
and are therefore not addressed in this discussion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons stated directly above, we are revising &sect;&sect;431.151, 431.153, and 431.154 to delete reference
to SNFs and ICFs as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;&sect;431.151 (``Scope and applicability.'') is revised so that subpart B of part 431 specifies the appeal
procedures the State must make available to an ICF/MR for which the State denies, terminates, or fails to renew certification
or a provider agreement for the Medicaid program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;&sect;431.153 (``Evidentiary hearing.'') is revised to state that
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_An ICF/MR whose certification or provider agreement is denied, terminated, or not renewed must be given an opportunity
for a full evidentiary hearing on the denial, termination or nonrenewal;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_If the facility requests a hearing, it must be completed either before the effective date of the denial, termination
or nonrenewal or within 120 days after that date; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The hearing must, at a minimum, include the provisions of &sect;431.153(e).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters responded to our specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request for comments on whether States, adversely affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the repayment statutory provisions of section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1919(h)(3)(D), should have the right to appeal resulting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disallowances to the Departmental Appeals Board (DAB) in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition to appealing a provider's certification of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance under part 498. The commenters said that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States should have this right to appeal but believed that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
few States would find it necessary to exercise this right. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree that States probably would not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
often find it worthwhile to challenge a decision that had 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withstood the test of an appeal in accordance with part 498. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, because section 1116(d) of the Act provides States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with a statutory right to reconsideration whenever HCFA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
takes a disallowance, and regulations at 45 CFR part 16 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide States with a hearing before the DAB when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disallowances are made, we agree that appeal to the DAB 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be an option for the States. At any such DAB 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing, the decision of the ALJ upholding HCFA's adverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action against the provider would, of course, be part of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few commenters noted that State hearings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will significantly increase, and stated that the regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact statement fails to consider the amount of time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveyors and other staff, including attorneys, will need to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepare for and participate in hearings. They commented 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that overall costs for which HCFA must reimburse the states 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be increased. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We recognize that the revised regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expand the initial determinations for which States are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to grant an appeal. However, we have no program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experience upon which to base a prediction of appeal volume 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or costs. There is not even a precedent to follow from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare program, inasmuch as the expanded initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determinations are also new in the Medicare regulations. We 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anticipate that, in many cases, providers will be able to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meet the necessary requirements before remedies are to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposed, thus obviating the need for a hearing. Moreover, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we are finding that the percentage of facilities with no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies continues to increase, thereby causing us to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
predict fewer facilities facing some form of appealable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcement action than has been the case previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of these factors which may affect the increased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of initial determinations that are appealable, we can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offer no valid prediction as to effect on volume or costs of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appeals. However, we expect that the informal dispute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resolution process will reduce the number (or scope) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse actions that lead to a hearing. Any increased net 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs to States that are found to occur will be reflected in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the budget process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because we are now providing for an informal dispute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resolution, we are revising &sect;431.154 (``Informal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reconsideration'') to delete references to SNFs and NFs and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
state that_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If the State decides to provide an ICF/MR with an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity for an evidentiary hearing required by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;431.153(a) only after the effective date of a denial of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation or termination, the State must offer the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ICF/MR an informal reconsideration, to be completed before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the effective date of the adverse action; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The informal reconsideration must, at a minimum, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_Written notice to the facility of the denial of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation or termination, and the findings upon which it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was based; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_A reasonable opportunity for the facility to refute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those findings in writing; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_A written affirmation or reversal of the denial, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
termination, or non-renewal.

Section 442.40&blank;Availability of FFP During Appeals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We proposed deleting &sect;442.40, which presently provides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for continuing FFP for up to 120 days after the effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date of termination of a Medicaid provider agreement if an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appeal is pending. (See the discussion of comments on part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
431 above.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters wanted to retain the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current provisions which allow for up to 120 days of FFP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during a State's appeal process. A few wanted Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funding to continue until a final decision is issued after a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing. A few stated that elimination of the current rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would provide no benefit to the overall process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As we stated in the proposed rule, it is our 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
belief that the needs of individual residents are best 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
served by the availability of prompt and effective remedial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action that will motivate the fastest efforts by providers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to comply with Federal program requirements. The Congress 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has already set the maximum time for a termination at 6 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
months. Because a State could be paid for perhaps as long 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as 4 months after the effective date of provider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
termination, the State would have no incentive to challenge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NFs to promptly comply with all program requirements. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is because, in all likelihood, the State would continue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funding the Medicaid facility while receiving Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments. If we eliminate Federal funding to the State on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more accelerated schedule, States are likely to stop funding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the NF once we stop Federal payments to the State. Thus, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater incentive will exist for NFs to promptly comply with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program requirements. Moreover, because the 120-day 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision would significantly delay the imposition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain remedies, it would not be consistent with section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1919(h)(2) of the Act, which calls for States to minimize 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the period of time between the identification of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies and the imposition of remedies. In our 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opinion, the residents will benefit because the facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in which they reside will come into substantial compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
faster. However, for the reasons previously explained, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have decided to continue FFP to ICFs/MR whose agreements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been terminated for up to 120 days after termination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
while we work on the publication of a separate rulemaking on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ICF/MR policy.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few commenters stated that if pre-hearings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were provided, the 120 day regulation would not be necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for SNFs and NFs, but that if pre-hearings were not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided, the 120 regulation should be retained in order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
give a facility time to present its side of the story before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suffering irreparable harm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed elsewhere in this preamble, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are providing for dispute resolution beginning with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provider's receipt of the official Statement of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deficiencies, in order to give facilities an opportunity to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rebut survey findings early in the process. By adding this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
feature to the enforcement process, we are balancing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needs of facilities to avoid unnecessary disputes and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protracted litigation, on one hand, with the interests of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility residents, which we believe to be paramount, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assuring the most rapid correction of deficiencies. In so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
doing, we believe that the continued application of the 120- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
day rule would upset this balance of interests that we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe the Congress intended us to have.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few commenters predicted that the courts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be clogged with pretermination or presanction hearings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if FFP were denied during the State appeal procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Post-termination hearings have been upheld 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by all the circuit courts that have analyzed the issue of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether post-termination hearings satisfy the due process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clause of the Constitution (see discussion titled, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Hearings: Medicare and Medicaid Consistency''). Moreover, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we do not believe that the courts will be eager to entertain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legal challenges from providers that have failed to exhaust 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their administrative remedies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We note that the Federal courts are not clogged with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pre-termination challenges when Medicare agreements are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminated and Federal funding ceases on the effective date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of termination. Under both Medicare and Medicaid, 30 days 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of funding will be available, as it is now, to provide a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period of time for orderly transfer of residents.

A few commenters believed that HCFA would be

punishing those States that aggressively implement the Act,

and some noted that States would have a financial incentive

Because the Medicaid program is a joint

Some wondered why HCFA's finding of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance takes precedence over a State survey agency's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finding of compliance, yet HCFA has no obligation to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FFP during the appeal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HCFA's finding of noncompliance takes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
precedence over a State's finding of compliance because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act mandates this result in sections 1919(h)(6) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1919(g)(3)(A). The Congress provided detailed procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for resolving differences between a State and HCFA, but did 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not provide that FFP should continue merely because HCFA and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a State disagree about a facility's compliance status. If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA's termination determination is overturned as a result 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the appeal process, the State would receive FFP based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the reinstated provider agreement should the State have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continued to make Medicaid payments to the facility.

Some commenters apparently equated the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
availability of 120 days FFP during the hearing process with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing a pre-termination hearing. These commenters noted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that Medicare's post-termination hearing does not cause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concern to most providers because Medicare pays for only a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small portion of days, whereas, to require post-termination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearings for Medicaid will cause greater concern because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more money is at stake.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As we explain more fully elsewhere in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preamble, we believe it is important that, in light of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
great similarity between facility requirements in Medicare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Medicaid and the fact that such a large percentage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities participate in both programs, appeal procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ought to be the same for both programs. Additionally, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because of the informal opportunities to resolve differences 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the form of an informal dispute resolution mechanism, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe that a facility's concerns for due process are more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than adequately protected when balanced with the interests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of nursing home residents in the swift correction of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies.

A new Subpart D of part 488, consisting of &sect;&sect;488.201&hyph;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
488.211, became effective on August 31, 1992, shortly after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed rule was published on August 28. This requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that we designate Subpart E, which was to consist of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;&sect;488.150&hyph;488.185, with subsequent numbers. To assist

Subpart E, with designations of the proposed rule shown in

Many commenters were concerned that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed definition of ``abuse'' is too broad and ambiguous. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unless the definition is amended, they believe it will

generate inconsistency in the survey process and overburden 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the system with complaints of abuse. Other suggestions and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendations are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Willfulness and/or deliberate intent should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporated into the definition; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Change ``and/or otherwise disregard of an individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which could cause or result in mild to severe harm'' and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replace with ``has caused or creates a high probability of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
causing serious harm'';

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We have considered the above comments and are revising the definition of abuse in &sect;488.301 to address some of
the aforementioned concerns. However, we do not believe it appropriate to adopt any one State's definition as there
is no evidence to suggest that one definition is superior to another. We are adopting the major concepts of the definition
in the Older Americans Act. Therefore, the modified definition of abuse now reads: Abuse means the willful infliction
of injury, unreasonable confinement, intimidation, or punishment with resulting physical harm, pain or mental
anguish.

 We do not accept this comment. Our obligation is to protect the health and safety of every resident, including those
that are incapable of perception or are unable to express themselves. This presumes that instances of abuse of any
resident, whether cognizant or not, cause physical harm, pain, or mental anguish.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 483.13(b) does not provide a definition of abuse. What it does provide is a list of the types of abuse from which
residents have a right to be free. The definition, a statement as to the meaning of the term ``abuse,'' is offered at
&sect;488.301.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters thought the proposed definition of ``neglect'' was too broad and ambiguous. They contend it is
necessary to narrow the definition in order not to inundate the system with complaints. Some commenters requested
that the terms ``willful'' and ``intent'' be inserted into the definition to limit the scope of actions that could
be considered neglect.

Response

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: In order to promote consistency in the survey process, there needs to be a common definition of neglect for a variety
of applications. We have, therefore, adopted the concept of the definition used in the Older Americans Act, as we explain
below. That definition does not incorporate the terms ``willful'' or ``intent.'' While an act of neglect can be intentional,
neglect can also occur unintentionally. However, we are specifying at &sect;488.335(e) that a State must not make
a finding that an individual has neglected a resident if the individual demonstrates that such neglect was caused
by factors beyond his or her control. If the inattentiveness is due to factors within that person's control, intentional
or unintentional, he or she can be considered to have neglected the resident(s). Therefore, while willfulness and
intent may be considered when a State finds that an individual has neglected a resident, we believe the terms ``willful''
or ``intent'' should not be included in the definition because neglect can occur unintentionally.

Comment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: Some commenters perceived that, in order for a finding of neglect to be made against an individual, the alleged neglect
must be within the individual's control or job responsibility. It was suggested that a provision be added to the proposed
definition that includes the individual's ``breach of duty to provide *&blank;*&blank;* needed *&blank;*&blank;*
services.'' The commenters contend that the proposed definition places the blame upon the individual and excludes
the extent of the culpability of the facility to provide the necessary services or goods.

: We agree that an employee should not be found to have neglected a resident if the neglect was caused by factors beyond
the control of the employee. As this provision is already addressed in &sect;488.335(e), we do not believe it needs
to be restated in &sect;488.301.

Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: As noted earlier, there has been no evidence to suggest that any State definition is preferable to ours. In fact, we

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: We agree that each resident should be free from neglect as well as other forms of mistreatment. This prohibition of
neglect is inherent in &sect;483.13(c). We do not believe the phrase suggested by the commenters defines the term.
Therefore, we did not include it in &sect;488.301.

Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: We do not accept this comment because neglect may be determined even if no apparent negative outcome has occurred.
The potential for negative outcome must also be considered. For example, instances of neglect may include, but are
not limited to, being left to sit or lie in urine or feces, isolating dependent residents by leaving them in their rooms
or other isolated locations, or failing to answer call bells to provide needed assistance.

it is overly broad. Other commenters wish to add the language incorporated within section 102(37) of the Older Americans
Act.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: Although the term ``timely'' does not appear in the final definition, we believe timeliness is an integral component
in determining neglect. A delay in providing needed services for a resident has the potential to cause physical harm
and/or mental anguish. Such a delay (or lack of timeliness) can be considered neglect under the definition we are incorporating
in the final regulation. We are adopting the concept from the Older Americans Act which provides that neglect means
failure to provide goods and services necessary to avoid physical harm, mental anguish, or mental illness.

Other commenters believed that licensed practical

nurses (LPNs) should not be included on the list because,

although licensed, LPNs are not professional nurses by

education or by legal accountability and must work under the

Several commenters recommended changing the

proposed definition of ``misappropriation of resident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
property'' to apply to the resident's ``real or personal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
property,'' as opposed to ``belongings or money,'' because they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe the current language is not broad enough to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
encompass every type of resident property. Other commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended that the definition include ``attempted'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misappropriation or the ``intent to deprive.''

We do not discern any substantial difference

between the terms ``belongings or money'' and ``real or

personal property.'' We believe the terms ``belongings or

money'' are sufficient to implement the statutory requirement

in sections 1819(g)(1) and 1919(g)(1) of the Act.

Additionally, the concept of ``intent to deprive'' is inherent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the phrase ``deliberate misplacement'' in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition. Therefore, we are not accepting these comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as we believe the suggested changes do not substantially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enhance the proposed definition.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Some commenters proposed to limit the

definition of misappropriation to that incurred by a nurse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We disagree. Limiting the definition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misappropriation to a specific individual would exempt all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
others from the provisions of the Act which explicitly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
states in sections 1819(g)(1)(C) and 1919(g)(1)(C):

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Some commenters wanted our definition to set 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a minimum of $50 on the amount of money or property which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be deliberately misplaced or wrongfully used without the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resident's consent in order to be considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misappropriation of resident property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We disagree because we believe that it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impossible to quantify the value of some personal items. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, possessions, regardless of their apparent value to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
others, must be treated with respect, for what they are and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for what they may represent to the resident. As no such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limitations are dictated by the Act, we interpret 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misappropriation to apply to any belongings or money, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regardless of their actual value.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Some commenters questioned whether the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed definition of ``nurse aide'' includes dietary aide or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
private duty paid individuals. They recommended that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of nurse aide be amended to read ``provides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personal care and nursing related services under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supervision of licensed nurses.'' Additionally, commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wanted a list of distinct duties required of nurse aides to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be added to the final definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We do not adopt these comments because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of a nurse aide is specified by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sections 1819(b)(5)(F) and 1919(b)(6)(F) of the Act and by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementing regulations at &sect;483.75(e).

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Some commenters stated that the phrase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``substandard quality of care'' was specifically used in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act and that HCFA should recognize and adopt the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
language. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We agree with the above comment. To be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the Act, we are using that terminology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
throughout this final rule, where appropriate.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Some commenters wanted HCFA to include ``any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violation of the requirements that leads to, or is likely to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lead to a failure of the resident to achieve the highest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practicable physical and mental well-being'' in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of substandard quality of care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are not accepting this suggestion. We 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe that any infringement of any requirement could be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
construed to compromise some ability of a resident to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieve his or her highest practicable well-being. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition proposed by the commenter could encompass every 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiency under every regulatory requirement. Given the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ramifications a determination of substandard quality of care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has for a provider (loss of NATCEP, notification of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensing boards and physicians), we are limiting the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of substandard quality of care to reflect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most egregious situations related to participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements under &sect;&sect;483.13 (``Resident behavior and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility practices''), 483.15 (``Quality of life''), and 483.25 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(``Quality of care''). However, we are not minimizing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies in other participation requirements. As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussed later under the response to public comments for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.401, it is possible that a deficiency under any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement can encompass any degree of seriousness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deficiencies under the remaining requirements can be more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriately addressed through specified remedies rather 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than through the loss of NATCEP which would be precipitated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by a substandard quality of care determination.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters thought that the scope and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
severity grid should not be a determining factor in defining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substandard quality of care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As we discuss later at &sect;488.404, we are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removing references to the scope and severity grid from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of substandard quality of care. We are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retaining, however, concepts of seriousness and frequency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which we believe are important to determining this type of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficient facility practices.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Other commenters wished to include compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
history in the final definition of substandard quality of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We do not agree with this comment. Our 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first priority is to protect the health and safety of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residents. If violations are identified, the problem must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be rectified, regardless of the facility's compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
history. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Some commenters wanted us to explicitly state 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the definition of substandard quality of care that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies of immediate jeopardy are regarded as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substandard quality of care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are not adopting this comment. Given the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ramifications a finding of substandard quality of care has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a provider, we are limiting the definition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substandard quality of care to those requirements mentioned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously. The only immediate jeopardy deficiencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered substandard quality of care are those determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the participation requirements of &sect;&sect;483.13 (``Resident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
behavior and facility practices''), 483.15 (``Quality of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
life''), and 483.25 (``Quality of care''). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because we are removing references to the scope and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
severity scales from the definition of substandard quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of care we believe that it is necessary to amend the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition. We are now defining substandard quality of care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as care furnished in a facility that has one or more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies related to participation requirements under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;&sect;483.13 (``Resident behavior and facility practices''), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
483.15 (``Quality of life''), or 483.25 (``Quality of care'') 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that constitutes immediate jeopardy, a pattern of widespread 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actual harm that is not immediate jeopardy, or widespread 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential for more than minimal harm, but less than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediate jeopardy with no actual harm.

Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While we do not agree with the suggested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition, we do agree with the intent of the commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that there should be some range of compliance within which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prospective and current providers may participate. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concept is discussed further in &sect;488.330 ``Certification of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance''. Accordingly, in &sect;488.301, we define 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``substantial compliance'' to mean a level of compliance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of participation such that any identified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies pose no greater risk to patient health and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety than the potential for causing minimal harm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As we discuss later in this preamble, a facility may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
avoid a remedy even if it has failed to comply perfectly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with all statutory requirements. However, the facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
still has the duty to provide the care to each resident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which enhances the chances for positive outcomes and avoids 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negative ones. If a single resident experiences 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
any 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
harm, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no matter how minimal, the facility will not have satisfied 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its statutory obligations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We acknowledge that there might be many definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that we could have chosen, but in our view, the definition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we have settled on best implements the Act and accommodates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both facility and resident concerns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, since we are incorporating the concept of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial compliance, we believe it is necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide a definition of noncompliance at &sect;488.301. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Noncompliance with the requirements of participation is any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiency that causes a facility to not be in substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There were several comments concerning the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement for and content of incentive programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Some commenters suggested that the incentives to reward 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality care be required and implemented on a national scale 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by HCFA as well as the States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A few commenters suggested that the States develop 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incentive programs with consultation from residents, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
families and the ombudsman. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;One commenter presented an elaborate process including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications, group evaluations and resident participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for any award. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;One commenter said that the regulation should define 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the rewards for quality to support quality improvement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1919(h)(2)(F) of the Act does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit HCFA to require the States to establish a public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognition or incentive payment system for nursing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities that provide high quality care. If the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters mean that the same public recognition or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incentive payment system be permitted for Medicare SNFs, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act does not authorize such recognition. In addition, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA program for nursing facilities would be duplicative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1919(h)(2)(F) of the Act gives States the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flexibility to decide if an incentive program would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate and how they will implement the program. If a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State decides to implement an incentive program, the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should have the option to consult those individuals and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organizations it thinks necessary. In the same vein, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be inadvisable to restrict the States' programs to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elaborate regulatory procedures because, in so doing, we may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inadvertently discourage States from establishing such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. Although we encourage States to develop effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incentive programs, we are not making any changes to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.303 because we want to preserve the States' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flexibility in establishing such incentive programs.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act provides that State expenses for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation and maintenance of an incentive program is an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorized Medicaid administrative expense: the Act does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit the use of funds collected from civil money penalties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for this purpose. Indeed, section 1919(h)(2)(A)(ii) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act provides that when the State uses the specified civil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
money penalty remedy, the State must apply funds collected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through civil money penalties to the protection of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health or property of nursing home residents. Therefore, we

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters suggested that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation should go beyond the Act and specify certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
topics and methods of training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Some wanted mandated educational programs for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment and care planning, resident rights and quality of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
care issues as well as those in subparts E and F of part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
488. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Other commenters believe that the scope of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
educational program should include a section on complaint 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigation and resolution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A few commenters asked that States work with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ombudsman program to develop and present training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Another commenter believes that literature and/or video 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 1819(g)(1)(B) and 1919(g)(1)(B) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act require that States conduct educational programs for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
staff and residents of facilities regarding current

regulations, procedures and policies of the long term care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

commenters that the proposed regulation unnecessarily

restricts the scope of the mandated educational programs.

We are revising it to permit the education programs to cover

all aspects of the long term care survey process so that the

States have the flexibility to structure the educational

programs to the needs of the facilities. The methods to

develop the programs (for example, consultation with the

left to the States.

A few commenters suggested that these

requirements be met, in part, by giving facility staff and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

We believe that this suggestion, if done at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the participant's expense, may have merit. Traditionally, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we have not had the ability within available resources to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accommodate all providers or other interested parties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wanting to attend training; our available resources are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
devoted, for the most part, to providing timely training for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveyors. However, being able to offer surveyor training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
universally to providers and interested others at their own 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost, and if space allows, may help improve understanding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and cooperation between surveyors and the other parties. We 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are, therefore, seriously considering what changes in policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and legislation will be necessary to allow this.

One commenter suggested that a review of the

The HCFA State Agency Evaluation Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(SAEP) currently is undergoing substantial review and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revision. We are unable, at this time, to assert that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review of State educational activities will become a part of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the revised SAEP. Nonetheless, the HCFA regional offices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will continue to have the responsibility to monitor and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assess the States' educational activities.

Several commenters suggested that the States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be directed to include bans on all new admissions as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required remedy because a ban on only Medicaid admissions is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discriminatory. A majority of those commenting suggested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a directed plan of correction also be included as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required remedy.

We do not have statutory authority to allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the States the option of banning all new admissions. States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are free, however, to enact their own laws regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility licensure that may extend enforcement options 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beyond the reach of the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1919(h)(2)(A)(i) of the Act expressly gives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States the authority to impose payment denials with respect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to new Medicaid admissions. While the Act also provides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States with the opportunity to design other remedies, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to Federal approval, that are as effective as those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enumerated in the Medicaid law, we believe that it would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inappropriate for us to evaluate a remedy that would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aimed at the admissions of persons over whom the Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
law provides no jurisdiction. We believe it would be more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate to leave to State law remedies that extend as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
far as the commenters suggest. In any event, while a denial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of payment for new Medicaid admissions does not reach all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential admissions, it will provide an incentive to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility to correct deficiencies rapidly, which would serve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to benefit not only Medicaid residents but all those persons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who are receiving care at the facility regardless of payment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source. Also, States may provide public notice of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposition of the denial of payment for new admissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedy which would alert potential residents to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situation in the facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are not accepting the suggestion that directed plans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of correction be a required remedy. As discussed under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Factors to be considered in selecting remedies'' later in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this preamble, we have provided a revised enforcement scheme 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in this final rule that correlates the seriousness of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance with the selection of remedies from within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified enforcement remedy categories. While we do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intend to mandate the specific selection of the directed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan of correction remedy from among the available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcement actions for any specific level of actionable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance, in other words, when the facility is not in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial compliance, we note that it is always an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcement option and it may be the only remedy used for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lower level deficiencies.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowed to implement additional or alternative remedies

The States must follow any internal State

procedures which govern the development and submittal of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid State plan amendment. The Act does not require nor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
do we believe our regulations should require specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures that would limit State prerogatives for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promulgating enforcement policies. Similarly, section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1919(h)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act states that the State must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate that any alternative remedies are as effective

as the remedies specified in the Act.

Commenters suggested that the effective

remedies established by the States be made applicable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dually participating facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are accepting this comment with some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clarification. Since States may establish their own 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanctions through their respective State plan amendment, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
since HCFA will be the entity imposing sanctions for dually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participating facilities, it is highly likely that a State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may choose to impose one of its own remedies on a Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NF which HCFA would have no authority to impose against the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare provider agreement. It would not be rational for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
us to proceed with an enforcement scheme whereby a single 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility, by virtue of participating in both Medicare and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid, would be subject to a dual enforcement track. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, and more importantly, since HCFA will be taking the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lead on enforcement actions against dually participating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities under part 498, we have concluded that HCFA needs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to have the authority to impose these alternative or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional remedies against Medicare facilities in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States that have established these remedies. While we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acknowledge that this would not permit consistency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nationally relative to remedies available for dually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participating facilities, we conclude that it is a realistic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and necessary response to statutory intent that enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decisions made regarding the Medicaid agreement, which could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include imposition of these ``other'' State remedies, will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applied by the Secretary to the Medicare agreement as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, under the Secretary's general rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority, this final rule provides that, if the State's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedy is unique to the State plan and has been approved by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA, then that remedy, as imposed by the State under its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid authority, can be imposed by HCFA against the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare provider agreement of a dually participating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility.

The Act provides no specific penalty for

State failure to implement the enforcement provisions of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act, nor do we wish to add one. However, there are existing

Medicaid rules regarding the submission of and adherence to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State plan amendments. If a State does not comply with the

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A large number of commenters opposed the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision at proposed 488.155(b) and suggested we delete it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This section states that the State survey agency's failure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to follow HCFA survey procedures will not invalidate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
otherwise legitimate determinations that a facility's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies exist. Because the provision does not appear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the Act, a few commenters questioned whether the Congress 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanctioned this policy, and certain commenters asked that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities be allowed to appeal surveyor noncompliance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the survey protocol. Many commenters felt that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision would encourage disregard of established survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidelines, and for this reason one commenter believed this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision would cause the standard survey to violate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fourth Amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We believe the provision accurately reflects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the intent of the Act and are retaining it in &sect;488.305(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To invalidate legitimate determinations of noncompliance and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leave them unaddressed would be in opposition to the mandate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of OBRA '87 that all requirements be met and enforced, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would lead to inconsistent application of the law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 1819(g)(2)(C) and 1919(g)(2)(C) of the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reveal the intent of the Act very clearly. These sections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
state that standard surveys must be conducted based upon a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protocol, but add that the failure of the Secretary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
develop, test or validate such a protocol will not relieve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any State or the Secretary of the responsibility to conduct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveys. Because the Congress intended for survey results 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be binding even when surveys were conducted in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
absence of a formal protocol, it is clear that the Congress 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
views the substance of survey findings to be of greater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importance than the process used to identify them. An 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appeal of a deficiency based on surveyor noncompliance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the established protocol would be inconsistent with this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
position, and as a result, we will not offer facilities an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appeal on these grounds. In particular, we wish to avoid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situations where otherwise well documented deficiencies are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to challenge, and potentially invalidated, simply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because a surveyor did not follow every last detail of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey protocol. We believe this would be surrendering all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substance to form and would clearly thwart Congressional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will. Moreover, since the source of binding requirements on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities is not in the survey protocol, but in the Act and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, the ultimate, and proper, test of facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance will not rest on whether the survey protocol 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was rigorously followed, but on whether a requirement of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act or the regulations has been violated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The foregoing does not imply that HCFA encourages or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condones disregard of its established survey policy; on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contrary, HCFA trains surveyors in survey policies and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures and is responsible for assessing State survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency performance and applying sanctions when there has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been a failure to use Federal standards and protocols. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance we provide to surveyors, and the expectation we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have that they adhere to our directives, contradict the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claim that surveyors are given unbridled discretion which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would render the standard survey an unreasonable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative search in violation of the Fourth Amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once a facility seeks participation in the Medicare or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid programs, it must accept the responsibility of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrating its compliance with Federal certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements which the Congress has directed must be done 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through the survey process. A facility cannot seek such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation, and accept program funds, and then argue that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal or State efforts to monitor compliance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
essential health or safety requirements constitute a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violation of the Fourth Amendment as an unreasonable search 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and seizure. In any event, surveys that nursing homes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experience in the Medicare and Medicaid programs are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable. They advance the government's interest in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protecting the health and safety of individual residents, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and because of the various requirements for surveys in both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act the Federal regulations, no facility can be said to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be unaware of its obligations to permit onsite visits by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State or Federal surveyors as a condition of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation in these programs. Commercial enterprises, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such as nursing homes, do not have the same expectation to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be free of warrantless searches as individuals in their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
homes do. Indeed, the United States Supreme Court has ruled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that warrantless searches of closely regulated businesses do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not pose a violation of constitutional Fourth Amendment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protections that commercial enterprises have.

We recognize that protocols and guidelines are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to promote consistent survey practice. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether or not a surveyor follows protocols must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subordinate in importance to whether or not a facility meets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal participation requirements. Violations must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognized and remedied appropriately if resident interests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are to be protected and integrity is to remain in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter questioned whether proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.155(a)(3) conflicts with subpart III of Appendix P of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State Operations Manual, Transmittal No. 250. Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
488.155(a)(3) would require the State survey agency to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include in the standard survey an audit of written plans of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
care and residents' assessments. Subpart III states that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review of the accuracy of resident assessments is to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed as part of the extended survey which is triggered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the identification of a deficiency in quality of care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the standard survey. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There is no conflict because a review of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comprehensive assessments and care plans is not limited to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the extended survey. It is also a major part of the Quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Care Assessment performed during the standard survey (see 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Task 5 in Appendix P of State Operations Manual Transmittal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No. 250). The review that occurs during the extended survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is slightly different, though, in that surveyors are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directed to review more recent care plan and assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information, and are given more flexibility in choosing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sample size than in the standard survey.

 One commenter suggested that we require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveyors to determine whether a facility attempted to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accommodate both the exercise of a resident's rights and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resident's health when there appears to be a conflict. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter believed that accommodation should include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exploration of care alternatives through a thorough care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
planning process in which the resident may participate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Surveyors are presently instructed to make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such determinations. At tag number F295 in the Interpretive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Guidance to Surveyors, the surveyor is directed to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether the care plan reflects the facility's efforts to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
find alternative means to address a problem if a resident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has refused treatment. Additional guidance concerning this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
matter is found at tags F174 and F158. We believe such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific instructions are more appropriately located in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State Operations Manual than in the regulation itself, so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we are not incorporating them into the regulation.

A few commenters suggested that we explicitly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mention a review of the quantity and quality of nursing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services staff in &sect;488.305(a)(2) where we outline a survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the quality of care.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Inherent in an evaluation of the indicators 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of care and services listed at &sect;488.305(a)(2) is an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examination of the quality of the staff providing them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of the observational portion of the Quality of Care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessment, surveyors are directed to make observations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
staff/resident interactions which necessarily involve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluating the quality of care and services provided by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
staff, which is an indication of the quality of the staff 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
itself. For this reason we do not explicitly mention this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment in the regulation. We do specifically address a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review of staffing in Appendix P of the State Operations

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We recognize the value of family input in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the survey process, and direct surveyors when interviewing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to provide the opportunity for all interested parties to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
give what they believe is pertinent information. We expect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this to include accommodating family members who wish to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
speak with the survey team but are unable to be at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility at the time of the survey. It is possible for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
family members to call surveyors at the facility and be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either interviewed over the telephone or scheduled for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personal meeting as the survey schedule allows. The survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
team is in a better position than HCFA to know how to best 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accommodate these groups within the time and personnel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constraints of the standard survey, and for this reason it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be unduly restrictive of us to require evening and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
week-end meetings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Neither will we require that there be an exit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conference specifically for family groups. If survey teams 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conduct an exit conference for facility residents, family 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
members are not prohibited from attending. If such a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conference does not take place, family members still have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
many other opportunities to learn about the outcome of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey. Survey results are available to family members 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whenever they visit a facility, because facilities are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to accessibly post the results of the most recent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey. These survey reports are thorough and detailed, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if a family member has any difficulty understanding the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results, he or she may resolve it by contacting either the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
long-term care ombudsman or the State survey agency.

One commenter proposed that we allow the

survey team to expand the standard survey when it identifies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substandard quality of care instead of requiring it to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conduct an extended or partial extended survey to

investigate the extent of the facility's problems.

We must reject this proposal. We are bound

by sections 1819(g)(2)(B) and 1919(g)(2)(B) of the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which require a facility to be subject to an extended survey

when it is found to have provided substandard quality of

In Appendix P of State Operations Manual

an audit of written plans of care, to determine whether care

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as necessary. We believe such detailed instruction is more

Comment:

Many commenters agreed that all surveys 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be unannounced. Some commenters stated that survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
schedules should be more unpredictable and one suggested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that there should be even more unannounced inspections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters emphasized that many nursing homes are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aware that they are about to be surveyed. One commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated that randomness of surveys has not yet been achieved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and that HCFA should require States to demonstrate through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey scheduling that chronically substandard facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been targeted. Another commenter stated that annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensure cycles, such as billings and certificates, may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compromise unannounced surveys. Several commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested that we require that the States provide a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
randomization plan or scheduling methods which would ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the timing of inspections is not predictable.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We realize that commenters, in many cases, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
feel it is preferable to have unannounced surveys for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
welfare of residents in nursing homes. However, after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
careful consideration, we have concluded that requiring all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveys to be unannounced is not mandated by the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, doing so would, in some cases, undermine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency of the survey process in which, for example, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only thing necessary to verify compliance is a request for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documentation or an interview with a particular part time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employee who may, otherwise, not be at the facility if a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey is not announced. We are, therefore, revising 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.307(a) to require that only standard surveys be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unannounced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We agree that survey schedules should be more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unpredictable and have made this more possible at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.308(a) by allowing the flexibility of conducting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard surveys no later than 15 months after the previous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey. We disagree with the recommendation that there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be more unannounced inspections than presently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by HCFA. The States are responsible for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining which facilities need to be surveyed and when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the surveys should be scheduled, subject to the requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of &sect;488.307. The States already have the obligation to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conduct extended surveys and complaint surveys as the need 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arises. Moreover, because of time and money constraints and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the difficulty of scheduling the surveys already required, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it would be unfair to place an additional burden on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States for conducting more surveys than required by law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We agree that complete randomness of surveys has not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been achieved but we believe that complete randomness should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be our goal. Sections 1819(g)(2)(A)(iii) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1919(g)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act provide for a flexible survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cycle. While the law does not specify the criteria to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to determine intervals between consecutive surveys, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States will undoubtedly use past performance as a primary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criterion. If past performance is considered in determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
how frequently to survey specific facilities, the survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cycle can not be completely random. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Our intention is to strive to have surveys conducted on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as random a basis as possible consistent with effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcement. We are aware that annual licensure cycles may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compromise unannounced surveys. However, we believe that, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over time, State licensure cycles will not be a factor in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey predictability since licensure and certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveys are generally conducted concurrently. In the event 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that States do not move to a more flexible licensing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
schedule, this will not create a problem because licensing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
schedules will not substitute for certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. We believe that it is unnecessary to require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States to provide a randomization plan for the timing of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveys because we are already stating at &sect;488.307(b) that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we will review States' procedures on at least an annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis. In addition, the law does not require States to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate that substandard facilities have been targeted, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but in examining the States' scheduling practices annually, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we will look for logical scheduling criteria and past 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance will undoubtedly be one of the reasonable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria States can use.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters stated that it is unfair 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for surveyors to come into a facility without any advance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice. Another commenter stated that unannounced surveys 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are not more beneficial than announced ones. This commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated that the Joint Commission on Accreditation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) announces its surveys and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that this practice is less stressful and avoids placing an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unnecessary mystique on the process since it is known that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey must occur 90 days before the license expires. (We 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assume the commenter is referring to the expiration of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accreditation.) This commenter feels that the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
objective is achieved. Another commenter stated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities should always be given a warning that a survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will occur and ample time to correct whatever is wrong.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We cannot accept the comments advocating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
announced standard surveys. To do so would be inconsistent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with sections 1819(g)(2)(A) and 1919(g)(2)(A) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, warning facilities in all cases of an upcoming 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey can undermine the accuracy of survey findings which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sometimes is predicated on the element of surprise.

``(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basic rule. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All surveys must be unannounced and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their timing should be unpredictable. State survey agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must adopt survey schedules that maximize the element of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surprise. Scheduling procedures and practices must not have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the effect of giving facilities notice of inspections. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, inspections should not occur around the same time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each year nor be conducted in a predictable sequential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cycle.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree that the timing of surveys should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be made as unpredictable to long term care facilities as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible. However, at this point, it does not seem 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practical or even possible to mandate, or enforce the total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unpredictability of surveys by States or to require that all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveys be unannounced, as explained in the response to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior comments in this section. We will be looking into the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possibility of incorporating some guidance on ways in which

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters suggested that &sect;488.307(b) be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changed to provide that HCFA shall identify successful 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scheduling methods, distribute them, then monitor State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency performance, taking corrective action when necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter thought that the way the provision was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
written, an agency gets constructive suggestions about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scheduling surveys only after the surveys have been done and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the time of a review of its procedures. Two other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters suggested it would be helpful if HCFA could put 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the Regional Office Manual the successful methods it has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified that assure that surveys are unannounced.

We disagree with these comments suggesting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that HCFA specify in regulations that it will provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
successful scheduling methods because we believe the States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are better able than we are to identify successful 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scheduling methods which may differ from one locality or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
region to another. Each State uses the methods that work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
best for it to schedule surveys within the required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
timeframes. We believe that the controls in place at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.307, which provide that all standard surveys must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unannounced, and that we will review each State's scheduling

One commenter asked what the term ``any

notifies a facility that a survey is scheduled. Another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter suggested that individuals other than an employee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Federal and State government should be held harmless 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from fine if he or she notifies a facility that it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scheduled to be surveyed. This commenter further suggests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that any individual who is fined for notifying a facility,

should have the right to contest the fine in a formal

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1919(g)(2)(A)(i), is clear that ``any individual'' who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notifies a nursing home of the time and date of a standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey is subject to a civil money penalty. We, therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disagree that only employees of the Federal and State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governments should be held responsible for notifying a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility that it is scheduled to be surveyed; any individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who knowingly advises a facility that a standard survey is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scheduled will be held accountable, according to the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any individual who is fined for notifying a facility is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entitled to the appeals mechanisms specified at section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1128A of the Act. The administrative appeals policy for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
civil money penalties imposed against an individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
announcing a standard survey is not established by HCFA but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rather by the Office of Inspector General (OIG) and is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
already in place.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters suggested that ombudsmen should be informed in advance of a survey in order to be able to participate
fully, provided ombudsmen are subject to the penalties mandated by law and to loss of employment if they cause the time
of the survey to be known. One of these commenters suggested that advance notice of the survey should be given to the
local ombudsman by means of a letter from the survey agency stamped ``CONFIDENTIAL.'' This commenter feels ombudsmen
should be informed in advance because they are currently notified on the first or second day of three or four day surveys
and may have already scheduled appointments which cannot be changed in order to accommodate the survey schedule.
This commenter feels that advance notice would guarantee better surveys by strengthening ombudsman/consumer input.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We disagree. Each additional individual or organization that has knowledge of a scheduled survey decreases the likelihood
that the survey will remain unannounced. The ombudsman is contacted soon after the survey team has entered the facility
and can participate meaningfully even if not present for the initial tour of the facility or other early phases of the
survey.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters stated that a $2,000 fine is not a severe enough penalty for willfully disclosing in advance the timing
of a nursing home inspection or taking advantage of foreknowledge of an inspection. Another suggested that this type
of violation should also be referred to the Department of Justice for prosecution for obstruction of justice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The $2,000 fine is the maximum allowable under sections 1819(g)(2)(A)(i) and 1919(g)(2)(A)(i) of the Act. The exact
amount of the civil money penalty is determined by the OIG. In response to the suggestion that this violation be referred
to the Department of Justice, OIG decides which cases are appropriate for such referral.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This commenter stated that &sect;488.307(c) is weakened by the use of the word ``standard'' and that civil money penalties
should be applied as a penalty for the announcement of any type of survey including validation, complaint, or other
surveys. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 1819(g)(2)(A) and 1919(g)(2)(A) of the Act are applicable to standard surveys only, so that the civil money
penalties specified at sections 1819(g)(2)(A)(i) and 1919(g)(2)(A)(i) are imposed for announcing standard surveys.
We do not have the statutory authority to require that civil money penalties be imposed for announcing anything other
than standard surveys.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The nursing home reform provisions of OBRA '87 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reconfigured the way in which HCFA and the States would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
track nursing home compliance with Federal requirements and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach enforcement remedies. The survey and certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions, set forth at sections 1819(g) and 1919(g) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act, require implementation of a flexible survey cycle for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare skilled nursing facilities and Medicaid nursing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities so that standard surveys are conducted at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intervals not later than 15 months after the date of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previous standard survey with a statewide average interval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that does not exceed 12 months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The legislative history of OBRA '87 and the National 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Academy of Science's Institute of Medicine (IoM) study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1986) are plain in their stated reasons for this change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the rigid, time limited system of having surveys for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all facilities follow a 12 month cycle. First, a flexible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey cycle provides less predictability to the scheduling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of surveys, thus reducing the opportunities for certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providers, by anticipating the survey, to achieve only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temporary compliance for the short term period around the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time of survey. Second, flexible survey cycles allow survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies to better allocate their limited resources by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increasing the frequency of surveys for problem facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
while allowing other facilities with a better record of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance to be less rigorously monitored. Additionally, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because time limited agreements have automatic cancellation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clauses, a significant paperwork and recordkeeping burden 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results from the frequent need to conduct resurveys as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
means of avoiding provider agreement expirations. Third, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the enforcement provisions of nursing home reform, set forth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at sections 1819(h) and 1919(h) of the Act, are designed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
work in the context of provider agreements that do not have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a fixed ending date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, sections 1819(h)(2)(C) and 1919(h)(3)(D) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Act speak to the ability of the Secretary to continue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments for up to 6 months after the identification of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies if certain criteria, described in those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sections, are met. Sections 1819(h)(2)(D) and 1919(h)(2)(C) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Act require the Secretary and States to impose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
denials of payment for new admissions should deficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities fail to achieve compliance within 3 months after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they have been determined not to comply with Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. In both cases, these remedies make sense only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where a facility's provider agreement has no set expiration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We reach this conclusion because under a time limited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement survey system in which surveys are typically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted shortly before the expiration of provider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreements, facilities would have only the shortest period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of time to correct deficiencies if they are to be entitled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to renewed agreements. The statutory remedies described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above, however, contemplate periods of time that far exceed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
what would be available under a time limited agreement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system for providers to achieve compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For HCFA and the States to attempt to fit this survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system into the procedures described in sections 1819(h) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1919(h) of the Act would require the wholesale revamping of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveys so that they occur no later than mid-way through the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
term of the 12 month provider agreement. Such a radical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
departure from more than 20 years of practice would require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the kind of massive reallocation of survey resources that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not possible under a time limited agreement survey system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and would likely cause many facilities to go unsurveyed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the time their time limited agreements are scheduled to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expire. Of equal significance, we do not believe that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress would approve of a survey system in which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decisions about renewal of a provider agreement are made as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
far as 6 months prior to the expiration of that agreement, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
since determinations of compliance made so far in advance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may not be reflective of the degree of facility compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the time the agreement is set to expire.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Continued implementation of time limited agreement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for skilled nursing facilities and nursing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities frustrated many aspects of nursing home reform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and, in a practical way, rendered them inoperable. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these reasons, a HCFA Ruling was signed on August 26, 1992 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eliminating time limited agreements for skilled nursing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities and nursing facilities participating in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare and Medicaid programs and these regulations further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopt this position. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 488.308 implements sections 1819(g)(2)(A)(iii) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 1919(g)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act, which require that each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
skilled nursing facility and nursing facility be subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a standard survey not later than 15 months after the last 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
day of the previous standard survey and that the statewide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average interval between standard surveys not exceed 12 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
months. The regulation specifies when and how the average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interval is computed, specific conditions that may prompt a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard or an abbreviated standard survey and HCFA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrective action to ensure that State survey agencies meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 12 month average interval requirement. These final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rules also codify the substance of the HCFA ruling described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above by eliminating from the regulations the requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for time limited agreements for SNFs and NFs.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter requested clarification of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15 month interval by asking if determination would be ``to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the day'' or ``during the 15th month.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We intend to calculate the 15-month interval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by counting days. The survey agency calculates the number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of days between the last day of the current standard survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the last day of the facility's previous standard survey. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters recommended that survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequency be related to the compliance/noncompliance history 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the facility. A few commenters suggested that States be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to conduct more frequent inspections of nursing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
homes with poor care histories. One commenter recommended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that States take facility compliance history into account 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when establishing survey cycles and conduct more frequent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveys of nursing homes with a history of substandard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality of care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are retaining this provision of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation as written because we believe that the Act, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously cited, provides a framework within which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State survey agency can establish a flexible survey cycle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that effectively ensures that quality health care is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
furnished in a safe environment. Without restricting this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flexibility, we expect that State survey agencies will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider a facility's compliance history when scheduling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard surveys and revisits. The survey agency may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conduct surveys as frequently as necessary to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with participation requirements, to confirm that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously cited deficiencies have been corrected, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigate complaints and to ensure that certain changes do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not cause a decline in the quality of care furnished to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resident.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters recommended that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional provision be incorporated which would allow State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey agencies to conduct tailored or abbreviated surveys 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in those facilities which were deficiency-free in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previous standard survey. Some additional commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended that facilities with a record of deficiency-free 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveys be inspected less frequently than every 12 months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter specifically suggested that surveys not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted yearly if there is in place good surveillance and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring from the State, and that, perhaps, over time a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey would be conducted every third year as hospitals are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveyed by the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Healthcare Organizations. One commenter recommended a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstration project that would test the possibility of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extended survey cycle for excellent facilities.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We cannot accept the comment to conduct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
abbreviated or tailored surveys of facilities that were free 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of deficiencies in the previous standard survey, because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act does not include abbreviated standard surveys in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
computation of the 15 month interval between standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveys of a facility or in the computation of the 12 month 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statewide average for all facilities in a particular State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Abbreviated standard surveys are premised on complaints 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received, or a change of ownership, management or director 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of nursing, or other indicators of specific concern and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore, could be focused on certain specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements, whereas, a standard survey is a periodic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection to gather information about the quality of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service furnished in a facility to determine compliance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the certification requirements for participation. To use an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
abbreviated standard survey instead of a standard survey in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the computation of the 15 month survey interval or the 12 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
month statewide average would not meet the intent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act, nor would it be an accurate assessment of the State's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ability to ensure that each facility furnishes quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health care in a safe environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 1819(g)(2) and 1919(g)(2) of the Act require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that each facility must have a standard survey no less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequently than every 15 months. With this constraint, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can accept the comment to conduct a standard survey of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities with good compliance histories less frequently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than every 12 months but not less frequently than every 15 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
months. Once we have had the benefit of experience under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the new survey process, we will consider whether it might be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate to approve a demonstration project that would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
explore whether other survey frequencies would be more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective.

office review of State survey agency workload planning.

This review will continue and can identify and respond to

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter was confused about how HCFA can

determine which facility survey did not meet the 12 month 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average interval requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

 The regulation specifies that it is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statewide average interval between standard surveys that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must not exceed 12 months, rather than the interval between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters suggested alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
language for proposed &sect;488.158(b)(2). These writers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended that the sentence which reads, ``If the provider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is a Medicaid facility, HCFA reduces FFP in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.170'' be replaced with ``HCFA will reduce FFP in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with &sect;488.170 and may apply corrective action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which includes the following:&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*'' or ``HCFA reduces FFP to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State in accordance with &sect;488.170.'' Another commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended that HCFA's corrective action be limited to

Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 While we appreciate the merits of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggestions, the FFP reduction formula now specified at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.320 has certain limitations as it cannot logically be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to sanction a State for failure to achieve a 12 month 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statewide average interval requirement for standard surveys. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is because a survey agency's performance in calculating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 12 month statewide average interval is unrelated to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terms of the FFP reduction formula. The formula is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comprised of two terms: the total number of residents in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nursing facilities surveyed by HCFA during a quarter and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
total number of residents in nursing facilities found, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with HCFA surveys, to be noncompliant. Thus, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statutory formula does not lend itself to remedying problems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States might be experiencing in conducting timely surveys. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, section 1919(g)(3) of the Act states that we may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respond to inadequate State survey performance in Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities by providing for the training of the State's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey teams. We are revising &sect;&sect;488.308 and 488.320 in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this final rule accordingly.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A commenter asked that we explain which date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is used for computation of the 12 month statewide average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interval when an extended survey follows a standard survey. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The last day of the standard survey, not the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
last day of the extended survey, is the date used in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
computation of the statewide average interval. Sections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1819(g)(2)(A)(iii)(I) and 1919(g)(2)(A)(iii)(I) of the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specify the statewide average interval between standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveys shall not exceed 12 months.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In examining the criteria which trigger 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
special surveys, one commenter agreed that survey agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may need to conduct a survey when changes occur as specified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the regulation. A few other commenters disagreed and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicated that an abbreviated or standard survey within 60 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
days of a change in ownership, management, nursing home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrator and/or director of nursing was stressful, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wasteful of taxpayer dollars or unnecessary. One commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically stated that the change of a director of nursing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a survey trigger was inappropriate and should be removed.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A few other commenters recommended that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation specify that other surveys (&sect;488.308(c)) must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted as frequently as necessary to determine compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with participation requirements and to confirm the

correction of previously cited deficiencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are retaining this provision in which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision to conduct other surveys under the circumstances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified at &sect;488.308(c) be at the State survey agency's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discretion. We expect the survey agency to base its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision on the individuals and facilities involved and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State's concern that the quality of care may have declined, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and to conduct a survey in those cases where one is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to confirm compliance with participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. The correction of noncompliance will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitored and verified by some type of follow up activity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which may or may not be a survey. Section 488.332 states 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the State survey agency conducts on-site monitoring as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needed when: a facility is not in substantial compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the requirements and is in the process of correcting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies; verification of continued substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance is needed after deficiencies have been corrected; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or, the survey agency has reason to question the substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance of the facility with the requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation. (Please refer to the discussion at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

monitoring of compliance.)

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed regulation indicates that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey agency may conduct a standard or an abbreviated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard survey to determine whether certain changes have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
caused a decline in the quality of care furnished by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility. The commenter recommended that the phrase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``decline in the quality of care furnished by'' be modified to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allow special surveys for the purpose of determining whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the facility is out of compliance with any conditions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Since the language of concern to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter simply reiterates the Act, at sections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1819(g)(2)(A)(iii)(II) and 1919(g)(2)(A)(iii)(II), we are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not free to modify the language as suggested. However, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe the Act gives States ample authority to conduct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveys any time they suspect that conditions at a facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be declining. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A commenter proposed amending the regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to expressly permit the survey agency to screen complaints 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to decide if they merit an on-site investigation. Another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter wrote that this rule goes beyond the Act and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires a standard or abbreviated survey in every instance, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including those which may be an isolated complaint or abuse. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter proposed revising &sect;488.308(e)(2) to read, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``The survey agency must conduct a standard or an abbreviated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard survey to investigate complaints of violations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the requirements by SNFs and NFs that the agency has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reviewed and determined to provide a reasonable basis for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigation.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are clarifying the wording of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision to say the survey agency must review all complaint 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allegations and conduct a standard or an abbreviated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard survey to investigate complaints of deficiencies in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements by SNFs and NFs if after reviewing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allegation, the survey agency concludes that a violation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one or more of the requirements may have occurred and only a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey can confirm that a deficiency or deficiencies exist. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A survey will not be conducted if the complaint raises 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issues that are outside the purview of Federal participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters advocated that HCFA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandate extended surveys and/or more frequent surveys (every 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6 months) whenever a facility has a nurse staffing waiver. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters reasoned that requiring extended surveys would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protect residents through the process of reviewing a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility's staffing, as required in sections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1819(g)(2)(B)(iii) and 1919(g)(2)(B)(iii) of the Act. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter raised the presumption that in the case of nurse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
staffing waivers, quality of care problems exist and need to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be closely examined. Further, the commenters fundamentally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
questioned the legality of granting nurse staffing waivers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because they believe it contradicts the statutory definition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a SNF and NF. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 While we agree that facilities with nurse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
staffing waivers should be carefully examined to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient staffing, we do not believe that conducting an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extended survey is the only means available to do so. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard survey, as described in the Appendix P of the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operations Manual Transmittal No. 250, permits surveyors to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expand the standard survey ``as needed'' for any reason 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without requiring an extended survey. Subpart I of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State Operations Manual, Appendix P, Section A states, ``If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in conducting the information gathering tasks of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard survey you identify a possible noncompliant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situation related to any requirement, investigate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situation to determine whether the facility is in full 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with the requirements.'' Therefore, surveyors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could review facility staffing records during the standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey to assure sufficient staffing. We wish to reserve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the use of extended surveys to those circumstances in which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we have found substandard quality of care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 We are not accepting the commenters' suggestion that we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require more frequent surveys for facilities with nurse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
staffing waivers. To do so would undermine the State survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency's ability to choose survey intervals. We believe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the Congress intended State survey agencies to have the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flexibility to choose the survey intervals. The law 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifies that the interval between 2 successive standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveys must not exceed 15 months and that the State survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency must maintain no greater than a 12 month Statewide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average for standard surveys. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 We do not address the comments regarding the legality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of nurse staffing waivers. The requirements for nurse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
staffing waivers are outside of the purview of this rule and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were included in a final rule published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Register

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters questioned the use of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey agency and HCFA discretion to conduct an extended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey at any time for any reason. Some commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disagreed that the Act gives HCFA or the survey agency the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discretion to conduct an extended survey at any time. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters urged HCFA to clarify that the purpose of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extended survey is to identify policies and procedures that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
caused the facility to furnish substandard quality of care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We disagree with commenters who believe that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act does not give HCFA or the survey agency the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discretion to conduct an extended survey at any time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 1819(g)(2)(B)(i) and 1919(g)(2)(B)(i) of the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically state, ``Any other facility may, at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary's or State's discretion, be subject to such an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extended survey (or a partial extended survey).'' However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we recognize that when facilities are subject to an extended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey or partial extended survey, they are disadvantaged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because they automatically lose approval of their nurse aide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training and competency evaluation programs (NATCEP) for two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years. There may be other instances when a facility would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lose their NATCEP, for example, when a facility has a nurse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
staffing waiver or has had a denial of payment for new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
admissions remedy, or temporary manager remedy imposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, as a matter of policy, we do not expect to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exercise our discretionary authority to conduct an extended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or partial extended survey unless we have found substandard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality of care on a standard survey or abbreviated standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey and we will advise the State survey agencies in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manual instructions to adopt the same policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 We have built into our survey process the ability of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the survey team to expand a standard survey at any time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The expanded standard survey can be tailored to the unique 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situation in a particular facility and need not include all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the tasks listed at &sect;488.310(b). It allows more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thorough investigation of specific areas in order to confirm 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance when the initial scope of the standard survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not adequate to substantiate a particular deficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
But it does not penalize a facility with loss of approval of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a NATCEP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 We are not including proposed &sect;488.160(c)(2) which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would spell out the State survey agency's and Secretary's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discretion to conduct extended surveys, as it is unnecessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
given the explicit language of sections 1819(g)(2)(B)(i) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1919(g)(2)(B)(i) of the Act.

The purpose of an extended survey is to determine the
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 extent of the problems and their effect on residents,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 when surveyors determine or suspect that jeopardy
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 exists, in order to document the problems fully and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 determine the appropriate combination of remedies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Extended surveys must be conducted whenever a facility
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 has been granted a waiver of nurse staffing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are not accepting this proposed change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because it is inconsistent with the Act. Sections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1819(g)(2)(B)(i) and 1919(g)(2)(B)(i) of the Act specify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that an extended survey must be conducted when the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or State survey agency finds substandard quality of care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Substandard quality of care does not necessarily pose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediate jeopardy to residents. Therefore, the commenter's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal is more restrictive than the Act. As we discussed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously, we are not requiring that the Secretary or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State survey agency conduct an extended survey when a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility has a nurse staffing waiver. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe that adding ``to determine the extent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problems and their effect on residents'' to the stated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose of an extended survey is not necessary because it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inherent in identifying policies and procedures that caused
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 substandard quality of care. For example, if there are poor
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 policies and procedures (rather than isolated practices that
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 don't conform to appropriate policies and procedures), the
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 extent of the problem in the facility could be potentially
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 pervasive.

Other commenters suggested that random
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 discretionary extended surveys are a good idea. However,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 they do not believe that penalties should be applied to
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 facilities as a result of such random surveys when the
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 facility was not cited for substandard quality of care.

 believe that we can achieve the indepth random survey

 favored by commenters through the standard survey. As we
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 discussed above, the State survey agency or HCFA may expand
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters disagreed with or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 suggested alternatives for the items included in an extended
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 survey, as specified in proposed &sect;488.160(b). Some
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 commenters asked that we add ``and review sampled residents
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 in more depth'' after paragraph (b)(1). The majority of
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 commenters asked that we delete paragraph (b)(5) which
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 requires that an extended survey include ``an investigation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 of any participation requirement at the discretion of the
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 survey agency.'' These commenters believe that the proposed
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 language exceeds the concept of the statutory language. In
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 part the commenters stated:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
It returns to the old methodology of checking
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 everything in contrast to the intent of the IoM study
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 and resident-centered outcomes. It would also waste
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 fiscal resources that could be better utilized
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 elsewhere in the survey system.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are not accepting the proposed amendment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 to &sect;488.310(b)(1) which would add the requirement that the
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 survey agency review sampled residents in more depth. The
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 purpose of an extended survey is to look at the policies and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 procedures that produced substandard quality of care. The
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Act only requires an expansion of the size of the sample of
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 resident assessments and not the depth of the reviews of the
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 residents themselves. A more indepth look at residents will
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 not facilitate an investigation of policies and procedures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 and should, therefore, be accomplished through a standard
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 survey if the survey agency so desires. We also disagree
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 with commenters that &sect;488.310(b) should not include ``an
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 investigation of any participation requirement at the
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 discretion of the survey agency.'' Section 488.310(b) says ``all'' and paragraph (b)(5) says ``any participation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 requirement at the discretion of the survey agency.'' This
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 does not mean, as the commenter suggests, that every
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 requirement would be surveyed, rather, only those that the
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 survey agency chooses.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter asked that we indicate whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 2 weeks specified in &sect;488.310(c) is 2 work or calendar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weeks (that is, 10 work days or 14 calendar days). Another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter asked that we define ``partial extended survey.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter wondered whether the survey agency would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notify facilities that they were going to receive an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extended survey.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are revising &sect;488.310(c) to state that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 2 weeks are computed in calendar days. We are defining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the term ``partial extended survey'' in &sect;488.301 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(``Definitions''). The survey agency will not notify a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility when an extended survey will be conducted. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey team will let the facility know at the exit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conference when it finds substandard quality of care. Based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the finding of substandard quality of care, the facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will then know that an extended survey will be conducted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any time within the next 14 calendar days. In most cases, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we expect that the survey team will conduct the extended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey immediately following the standard survey especially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when it would be more cost effective for the State to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete both the standard and extended survey while on site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rather than scheduling another visit.

Section 488.312&blank;Consistency of Survey Results 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We specifically asked in the preamble of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation for comments or suggestions for enhancing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveyor consistency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters support efforts by HCFA to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assure consistency of survey results and the application of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies. However, it was stressed that consistency should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not receive greater emphasis than accuracy and efficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Increased accuracy of the citation of deficiencies will lead 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to greater consistency within the survey process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the preamble of the proposed rule, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stressed that surveyors should be trained to ``exercise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistency and accuracy.'' We agree that accuracy is as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
important as consistency and we are including the term in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the text of the final regulation. Additionally, we believe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the recommendations of the studies and analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by the regulation should be implemented to enhance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistency and be monitored by each HCFA regional office. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These changes are reflected in the final text at &sect;488.312.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters suggested the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumers, ombudsmen, other resident advocates, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providers to evaluate the quality of the survey process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule requires each State survey agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to implement programs to enhance consistency. Each State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey agency is encouraged to gather pertinent data and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider varied sources in its data collection. While we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agree with this suggestion, we do not want to limit, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, what data each State may consider. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters also suggested that deference be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
given to the data compiled on survey consistency by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``entities and their associations.'' These commenters believe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that these data are valuable and often compiled in a manner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which permits ``valid and reliable statistical conclusions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about the degree of inconsistency among surveyor results.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, these commenters wanted the final regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to require survey agencies to consult with the regulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities as part of the effort to reduce inconsistency among 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey teams.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We assume that the commenters mean ``long-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
term care facilities'' when they refer to ``entities and their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associations.'' Sections 1819(g)(2)(D) and 1919(g)(2)(D) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act require that the State (and the Secretary under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1819) implement programs to improve consistency in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the interpretation and application of survey results among 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveyors. The intent of the Act is to assign the authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to administer these programs to the States, not to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities. In fact, the compilation of data to allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statistical conclusions about surveyor consistency may be a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part of the programs that the law requires the States and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary to establish. As far as mandating that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State survey agency must consult with facilities in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effort to ensure consistency, we believe it is unnecessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to require this in regulation as it is already inherent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the survey process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Other commenters wanted the required studies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and programs outlined within the final regulation or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State Operations Manual. A few commenters wanted a written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality assurance program approved by HCFA which would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outline specific data to be included in the required studies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The only requirements that we are specifying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in regulations are that the State survey agencies must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider surveyor accuracy as well as consistency. We 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe that it is preferable for individual State survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies to develop their own programs.

Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As previously stated in the preamble to the
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 proposed rule, HCFA has implemented an exhaustive surveyor
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 training and testing program that will ensure that surveyors
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 are adequately trained and competent at performing surveys. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This requirement is in &sect;488.314.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Some commenters advocate the review of every
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 statement of deficiencies by survey agency supervisory
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 personnel for compliance with the requirements before the
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 statement is sent to the provider.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As stated in the preamble of the proposed
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 rule, surveyors will, based upon their collective
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 information, match the data to the legal standards the
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 facilities are obligated to meet in order to determine if
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 deficiencies exist. Most State survey agencies already
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 employ some type of supervisory review for all statements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 deficiencies prior to provider notification. However, we
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 will not require a 100 percent supervisory review in all
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 State survey agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A few commenters suggested that a procedure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for maintaining and monitoring records of individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveyor's proficiency should be initiated and these records 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be considered in the preparation of deficiency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports for facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are not making changes suggested by this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter because there is no statutory basis for using the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records of individual surveyor's proficiency in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation of deficiency reports. Compliance is something 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieved or not achieved by the facility; therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual surveyor proficiency records do not obviate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obligation of each facility to abide by Federal regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All decisions regarding the preparation of deficiency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports are made as a team, rather than by individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
members. In fact, we require team decision making and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide comprehensive training on the regulations and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documentation techniques in order to enhance consistency.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter claimed the section of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulation regarding consistency violates the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congressional mandate to establish new programs to improve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistency by stating ``*&blank;*&blank;* the collective exercise of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveyor judgements, which has always been the vehicle for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the identification of deficiencies, will remain unchanged.''

(57 FR 39290)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We do not agree with this comment. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above passage refers to the method by which the survey team 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collects the data for the identification of deficiencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following the above passage, as stated in the preamble of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed rule, this ``collective exercise'' is described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as how ``*&blank;*&blank;* surveyors will 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
gather 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
information based upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
direct observations, record review, and interviews with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residents, staff, and family members'' (emphasis added). (57 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FR 39290) Through training, surveyors are instructed on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this method of information gathering which assists them in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identifying situations that are indicative of a facility's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with the regulations. Additionally, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congressional mandate refers to the ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
establishment 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
of new

programs, studies and analyses'' (emphasis added), not to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method in which the information is gathered.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

consistency being sought in the application of enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies as well as the survey procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We agree with the commenters. The final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation requires that State survey agencies conduct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs designed to enhance consistency in the application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of enforcement remedies as well as in survey results.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A few commenters questioned the inclusion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the application of remedies as part of the evaluation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey consistency. They assume it is not the surveyors who

remedies.

Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We recognize that the surveyors are not ultimately responsible for the selection and implementation of remedies.
As stated in the preamble of the proposed rule, it is the surveyor's responsibility to ``*&blank;*&blank;* 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
recommend
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 one or more remedies to either HCFA or the SMA [State Medicaid agency] for the enforcement of the requirements.'' (emphasis
added) However, we disagree with the comment questioning the inclusion of the application of remedies as part of the
evaluation of survey consistency. As it was the intention of the Congress to ``*&blank;*&blank;* measure and reduce
inconsistencies in the application of survey 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
results
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 *&blank;*&blank;*,'' (emphasis added) we interpret sections 1819(g)(2)(D) and 1919(g)(2)(D) of the Act to include
both inconsistencies in survey findings as well as inconsistencies in the application of enforcement remedies.
In order for each State survey agency to measure accuracy and consistency in the application of survey results among
surveyors, it must first ensure that these results are consistent across surveyors, and then determine that the enforcement
actions precipitated by the survey results are consistently applied.

 One commenter suggested that facilities be requested to fill out a questionnaire after their survey to give feedback
on the quality, competence and attitude of their survey teams.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We believe that it is unnecessary to require a questionnaire because feedback is inherent in the survey process. There
are numerous times throughout the survey process for the provider to comment upon the performance of the survey team.
Providers have the opportunity to question survey findings during the survey, at the exit conference, while awaiting
receipt of the official deficiency statement, upon receipt of the same, and through dialogue with the State survey
agency and HCFA regional officials.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Virtually everyone who commented on this proposed section emphasized the importance of ensuring that surveyors
have the appropriate professional credentials for the job and that they receive adequate training. For the most part,
the only differences were over exactly what constitutes ``appropriate'' professional credentials and ``adequate''
training. Opinion ran the gamut from maintenance/safety experts to physicians with experience in geriatric medicine
or long term care. Some suggested that trainees work under the supervision of an experienced surveyor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Numerous commenters offered suggestions regarding team composition. Two examples included_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A nurse, licensed administrator, pharmacist, nutritionist, and social services/activities therapist;
and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A nurse, a maintenance/safety expert, and a social worker.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that one team member must be ``a physician trained in geriatric and psycho-pharmacology,''
and said that, ``To the extent the new survey process incorporates new guidelines for chemical and physical restraints,
a physician (MD/DO) team member must be included.'' Some said that nurse surveyors should have, as a minimum qualification,
a B.S.N. One commenter said that the nurse on the team should have spent 2 or 3 years as a director of nursing at a long term
care facility. Other disciplines that commenters said should be represented in the ranks of surveyors include speech-language
pathologists, sanitarians, gerontologists, and dietitians. A number of commenters suggested a specific requirement
that all surveyors must have at least 1 year of experience with geriatric populations in a health care or related setting
or experience in long term care. Some said that this experience should be ``hands on'' experience, and a few commenters
suggested that we set forth the size of the team in regulations, with the size being proportional to the number of beds
in the facility or increasing in certain instances such as a historical pattern of serious deficiencies or complaints.

Many commenters asked for clarification of the meaning of ``multidisciplinary'' and ``professionals,'' and one
suggested we use the word ``interdisciplinary'' instead of ``multidisciplinary.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, one commenter said that surveyors should be sent to the same facilities year after year so that they become
more familiar with the facility and its staff. This would, the commenter suggested, enable the team to do a better job.
Another commenter said that surveyors should be rotated among facilities to maintain their objectivity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are deleting the modifier, ``health,'' and clarifying the term, ``professionals,'' in &sect;488.314(a)(1)
by setting forth examples. Examples of professionals include physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners,
physical, speech, or occupational therapists, physical or occupational therapy assistants, registered professional
nurses, dieticians, licensed practical nurses, sanitarians, engineers, and social workers, but are not completely
inclusive; the State, subject to HCFA's approval, determines what constitutes a ``professional.'' We are deleting
the word ``health'' because it may be appropriate in some cases to include other types of professionals on a survey
team. For example, if the facility has or may have structural problems or other physical plant facilities, an engineer
may be needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have chosen to continue to use the term ``multidisciplinary,'' rather than change it to ``interdisciplinary.''
Dictionary definitions of the prefixes ``multi-'' and ``inter-'' are very broad, with the former generally meaning
``more than one,'' and the latter generally meaning ``between or among.'' Therefore, we believe that ``multidisciplinary''
is the more appropriate choice. Furthermore, ``multidisciplinary'' is the term used in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Different States have different licensure requirements and different staffing patterns. Also, it is difficult
to recruit qualified professionals in certain areas of the country. Therefore, other than requiring that there at
least be a registered nurse on the team, we do not believe dictating to the States in Federal regulations the precise
composition of survey teams is necessary at this time. (The registered nurse member of the team is necessary because
SNFs and NFs are primarily engaged in providing skilled nursing care and/or related services.) The most important
considerations are that the surveys be conducted by professionals and that the survey guidelines be followed. All
surveyors must pass HCFA's ``Surveyor Minimum Qualifications Test'' (SMQT), which is in itself, a test of several
disciplines directly related to the survey of health care facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cogent cases can be made both for and against surveyor rotation, as is evidenced by the comments themselves. For this
reason, we are considering this an administrative matter and leaving it to the discretion of the States.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter thought that &sect;488.314(a)(2)(i) should be expanded to include surveyors who serve, or within
the previous 2 years, have served as a member of the staff or as a consultant to the chain of which the facility is a part
(if applicable). Another commenter said that we should also disqualify surveyors who work or who have worked in the
previous 2 years as agency staff. The commenter said that, in many States, nurses who work for agencies and are sent
to nursing homes for discrete periods of time are not always considered to be ``staff.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other suggestions were to revise &sect;488.314(a)(2)(ii) to disqualify surveyors who_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Own a part of any nursing home in the State;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Own a part of any nursing home in the United States;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Have a financial interest or any direct or indirect ownership interest in the facility to be surveyed, or in
any related facility, company, or chain; or

&bull;Have an immediate family member who is a resident or an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employee of the facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Finally, one commenter wants to prohibit any surveyor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from accepting a job with a facility for 1 year after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual has last surveyed it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to comments, to preclude 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conflicts of interest and to ensure survey objectivity, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are expanding &sect;488.314(a)(2) to disqualify anyone from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveying a facility if he or she works, or, within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previous 2 years, has worked as an employee, as employment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency staff at the facility, or as an officer, consultant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or agent for the facility to be surveyed. The surveyor is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also disqualified if a member of his or her immediate family 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has, or, within the previous 2 years has had, such a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relationship with the facility or if a member of his or her 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediate family is, or within the previous 2 years has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been, a resident of the facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;488.314(a)(2), we continue to disqualify surveyors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who have a financial interest or any ownership interest in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the facility but have deleted the modifying phrase ``direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or indirect'' to preclude misunderstandings. One commenter, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for example, interpreted the restriction against ``indirect'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial interest to mean that a surveyor would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disqualified if he or she held shares in a broad-based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mutual fund which included ownership in health care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities. (This was not our intent.) The issue of what 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constitutes disqualifying financial interest must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussed in considerable detail, and our manuals provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the most appropriate vehicle for this discussion. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we have broken out the parallel restriction on surveyors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whose family members have direct or indirect ownership 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest and placed it in a new &sect;488.314(a)(2)(iii). We 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are also extending the &sect;488.314(a)(2)(i) disqualifying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement to family members in paragraph (a)(2)(iii). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, in a new paragraph (a)(2)(iv), we disqualify any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveyor who has an immediate family member who is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resident of the facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe that these safeguards are sufficient to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure objectivity and that nothing beyond these is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warranted. Finally, in our view, prohibiting any surveyor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from accepting a job with a facility for 1 year after he or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
she has last surveyed it is unnecessary and would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difficult to enforce. Whether or not the ex-surveyor has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveyed that particular facility before would be of less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefit to the facility than the in-depth knowledge of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal requirements that the individual could share with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the facility. We believe that such knowledge can help the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility achieve and maintain compliance which ultimately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
serves the residents. The protection of the residents' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health, safety, dignity, and general interests is our 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primary goal.

&bull;No one should be a member of a survey team unless he or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
she has successfully completed a training and testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program, not only on how to conduct a standard survey, but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on how to conduct an extended survey as well. Proof of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
successful completion of this training must be made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available to the facility prior to the initiation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Before a citation is given, the surveyor must be able 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to demonstrate a negative outcome. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter said that the HCFA policy that surveyors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are not to be consultants is a great disservice; surveyors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should adopt a role like the JCAHO surveyors. Another said 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that HCFA should convene a national group of experts, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including State and Federal surveyors with extensive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experience, nursing facility providers, and consumers, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identify the knowledge and skills needed by survey teams. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some said that surveyors should pass not only the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial examination, but be tested annually. The passing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scores for the tests should be 85 percent or more, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters said, and the results of the testing and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remediation must be made available to the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter said that, when surveyors are cross-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trained, their expertise in the new area is not good enough 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to survey facilities' performances in that area. For this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reason, the commenter suggested that &sect;488.314 be revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``*&blank;*&blank;* to preclude the use of surveyors without demonstrated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professional training and experience in the substantive area

being surveyed. By professional training and experience,'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the commenter said, ``we do not mean on-the-job or inter-

agency in-service training. Rather, we mean graduates of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accredited or approved educational institutions.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter said that there should be no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``grandfathering'' of surveyors. Another asked the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three questions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;What validity and reliability studies were conducted to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure the test measures the ability of surveyors to perform

their functions in a consistent manner? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Has the test been validated to allow States to meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their affirmative action plans? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Are the results of the tests in line with the State's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The listing of suggested topics for surveyor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training was extensive. Some of the items (for example, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correct application of the applicable statutes and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, quality of care standards, and proper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documentation) are already covered in surveyor training. We 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe others are inappropriate to require as part of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey training; they should be provided as part of each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
team member's initial and continuing training within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
context of training for his or her area of professional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expertise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We would encourage, but do not require, States to allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveyors in training to act as observers on actual surveys 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the field, and are taking all possible measures to meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the demand for surveyor training. For example, we are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
planning to use satellite transmissions for training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
courses. We have already begun to move ahead with one of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The qualifications for surveyors, other survey agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personnel, and HCFA trainers, we believe, are already high. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In our operating experience, we have seen no reason to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe otherwise. Even if we required that each team 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include a physician, as some commenters recommended, we are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not certain that some providers would be any more pleased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the survey results than they are now. We remain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unconvinced that one must be a physician or an acknowledged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expert in a clinical specialty in order to perform a valid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey. We believe that the heart of the survey process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consists of clear guidelines and a detailed review of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The suggestions that survey training materials be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published for public comment are addressed under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Determination of a Deficiency'' section of this preamble. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The suggestion that providers be permitted to attend 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey training courses at their own expense has merit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Traditionally, we have had no provisions for accommodating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all providers interested in attending: our resources are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxed enough by simply trying to provide timely training for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveyors. However, being able to offer surveyor training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
universally to providers at their own cost may help improve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
understanding and cooperation between surveyors and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providers. We are therefore seriously considering the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes in law necessary to allow this. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We do not accept the suggestion that surveyors present 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providers with proof of the successful completion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveyor training. The fact that a surveyor is sent by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State or HCFA is, in itself, evidence that the bearer meets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the requirements to be a surveyor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of the commenters did not make any suggestions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with respect to the proposed rule. Instead, their comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were in the context of denigrating surveyors with whom they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
had had unpleasant experiences, declaring that running a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility is costly, frustrating, and unappreciated, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protesting the whole survey process in general. Because no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific suggestions were made concerning the proposed rule, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we are unable to respond to these kinds of broad complaints. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters suggested revising the end of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the sentence at proposed &sect;488.164(c) as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
*&blank;*&blank;* completed the required training and competency testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program.'' Another said that, at the onset of each survey, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities should be told which surveyors are serving as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
observers, and regulations should stipulate that these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals should be excluded from active participation in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the survey process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some other commenters said that surveyors-in-training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be allowed to participate in the survey process as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
long as they are appropriately supervised. They said that, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
historically, these individuals have been used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``*&blank;*&blank;* collect information to be used by qualified surveyors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the deficiency decision making process.'' Further, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two commenters said, not allowing surveyors-in-training to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
observe would mean that new surveyors would face significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
periods of nonproductive time while waiting for courses to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be offered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree that surveyors must not only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete the required training, but the competency testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program as well. However, paragraph (c) already requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a surveyor successfully complete ``*&blank;*&blank;* a training and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing program.'' We do not agree that the survey team 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should, at the outset of a survey, identify which of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
members (if any) have not yet completed the required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training and competency testing program. We also disagree 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that surveyors who have not yet completed the training and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing program should ``be excluded from active 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation.'' We do not want to prohibit the ``historic'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
role of observers mentioned by two of the commenters, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is, to ``*&blank;*&blank;* collect information to be used by qualified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveyors during the deficiency decision making process,'' or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forbid individuals from making valuable contributions to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey process if they are in a position to do so. We are, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore, amending this section (&sect;488.164(d) in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule) redesignated as &sect;488.314(c)(3) in the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule, to provide that the survey agency may permit an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual who has not completed a training program to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate in a survey as a trainee if accompanied onsite 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by a surveyor who has successfully completed the required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training and testing program.

Proposed &sect;488.166&blank;Validation Surveys
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We have reconsidered the necessity of including this section in the text of the regulation, and have concluded that
it would be pointless and redundant to retain it. We believe that the statutory provisions upon which this section
is based are self-implementing, and that regulatory interpretation is not needed to clarify them. In addition, the
few elaborations on the requirements in sections 1819(g)(3) and 1919(g)(3) of the Act, which are found at &sect;488.316
are duplicated elsewhere in the regulations, and we believe there is little reason to repeat them. Appeals applicable
to certifications of noncompliance based on validation surveys will be conducted according to &sect;488.330, Certification
of compliance or noncompliance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the absence of a regulatory section devoted to validation surveys, we are adding a definition of a validation survey
to &sect;488.301, Definitions, to serve as a reference because the term is used elsewhere in the regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Our decision to not finalize proposed &sect;488.166 does not make the public comments we received on this section
any less valuable for they are still pertinent commentary on validation survey policy and we are responding to them,
accordingly.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters insisted that HCFA validation surveys should be conducted concurrently with the State survey.
Other commenters encouraged HCFA to use the Onsite Performance Assessment and Training Survey (OSPATS) as the validation
survey method. Still other commenters said the HCFA validation survey should be as soon as possible after the State
survey, but no more than 2 weeks, 3 weeks or 30 days after the State survey. Most commenters noted that survey findings
may vary slightly from day to day and that it was essential that both survey teams were viewing the same set of facts.
In addition, concurrent surveys cause less disruption to facilities and residents and enable HCFA to provide immediate
feedback to State surveyors. One commenter recommended that HCFA validation surveys not be concurrent; another
said the unexpected nature of the validation survey was important in that the facility will return to its ``normal
daily routine'' after the State survey; and one commenter said the HCFA validation surveys were a waste of time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree with the commenters as to the advantages of a validation survey concurrent with the State standard recertification
survey. To that end, HCFA has developed the OSPATS. The OSPATS long term care survey process has Federal surveyors
assessing the facility while evaluating State survey agency performance. This process, which is fairly new for long
term care surveys, is believed by some providers to be less disruptive to facilities and residents. It does ensure
that both Federal and State surveyors observe the same conditions in the facility. It is our intent to expand the use
of the OSPATS process for validation surveys. We also agree that when the validation survey is not concurrent with
the State survey, it should occur as soon as possible after the State survey. Sections 1819(g)(3)(A) and 1919(g)(3)(A)
of the Act permit a 2 month period; in practice HCFA attempts to schedule the surveys closer to the State survey. However,
often there are scheduling and/or travel difficulties, which make minimum intervals between the two surveys difficult
to achieve. We want to retain the flexibility to use whatever survey process best achieves the goals of the Act. The
commenters who said that the validation surveys should not be concurrent or were a waste of time presented no reasons
or alternative proposals. We can say only that validation surveys, concurrent or not, are mandated by sections 1819(g)(3)
and 1919(g)(3) of the Act.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters proposed that HCFA establish procedures that would enable resident advocates, families and
the interested public to request validation (complaint) surveys for specific facilities. These procedures should
include public notice including a regulatory requirement that a poster notice be displayed in facilities. HCFA would
be required to respond to such requests and investigate complaints against facilities and allegations of poor performance
of State agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Disclosure of survey-related information is in accordance with &sect;488.325, and it is also discussed in detail
under the section of this preamble entitled, ``Disclosure of Survey Information.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We understand the concerns expressed by the commenters who would like HCFA to perform complaint investigations and
validation surveys at the request of advocates and other individuals. The Act and current regulations ensure that
the State survey agencies will respond to allegations of poor care or abuse and will investigate these allegations
according to State law and HCFA requirements. Most complaints directed to HCFA are referred to the State agencies
for investigation. HCFA is not staffed sufficiently to respond directly to complaints and/or requests for validation
surveys. The small HCFA survey staff is occupied fully in the assessment of State agency performance of its survey
and certification responsibilities under section 1864 of the Act. Because of these constraints, we are unable to
accept the commenters' suggestions.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Certain commenters asked that we give a facility that is dissatisfied with the State survey the ability to request
a validation survey and receive it within a reasonable time period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As mentioned above, we do not have the resources to conduct validation surveys upon every request. If a provider believes
that the State survey was done in an inappropriate manner, it may file a complaint with the HCFA regional office at whose
discretion a validation survey may be, but need not be, performed.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter was concerned that when selecting facilities for validation surveys, HCFA will not draw a random sample
but will select inferior facilities in order to cut its Medicaid obligations to the States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This fear is groundless. It is not the quality of the facility that determines whether the State will be sanctioned
for inadequate State survey agency performance, but rather the quality of the State's assessment of the facility
which is relevant. Facility noncompliance does not reflect poorly upon the State unless the State has failed to identify
it.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter believed that the identities of facilities on which validation surveys are to be performed should not
be disclosed to the State survey agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There is no justification for such a policy. Currently, HCFA notifies States of an impending validation survey either
3 days before a nonconcurrent Federal validation survey or 3 weeks before a Federal/State OSPATS survey. In the case
of the nonconcurrent Federal validation survey, this allows the State to arrange to have a surveyor present to observe
the Federal survey and take advantage of the instructional opportunities that it presents.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters with recent experience with validation surveys noted that the State and Federal surveys were
very different; the Federal surveys stressed concepts (for example, use of restraints) not emphasized by the State.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The primary emphasis of the Federal validation survey is on assessing State survey performance. Therefore, the Federal
review may stress certain areas of compliance in which an evaluation of State performance is particularly important.
In addition, the long term care survey protocol has only been in effect since October 1990, with appropriate instruction
enhancements for the final long term care regulations which were effective April 1, 1992. It is not unusual that some
variation in emphasis will occur in a new survey process. HCFA is committed to a survey process that produces accurate
and consistent findings. To that end, we have organized numerous educational sessions for Federal and State surveyors,
held regional training conferences in the HCFA regions and produced the ``Principles of Documentation'' which is
an attempt to standardize the writing of deficiency citations. Despite all of these continuing efforts, some variation
will remain as long as human beings perform surveys and statutory requirements involve the making of professional
judgments. As far as the use of restraints is involved, the decrease of restraints has been a HCFA priority since the
inception of the new survey protocol.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter suggested that HCFA perform validation surveys of all facilities that have a waiver of the RN director
of nursing or other licensed nursing requirements for a year or more. Others suggested that HCFA list the criteria
it uses to select facilities for validation surveys and that the validation sample should reflect the State's diversity
in location, size and ownership of facilities.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The selection of facilities for validation surveys depends upon which facilities the State has surveyed recently
or intends to survey imminently. Within those constraints, the typical sampling process for selecting facilities
for a validation survey ensures that a wide variety of facilities are selected. Because of this and the heavy demands
placed upon HCFA survey staff, we do not accept these suggestions that add survey responsibilities not mandated by
the Act. Moreover, we do not see the necessity of targeting facilities with waivers for validation surveys because
an annual review of the appropriateness of each waiver will be conducted whether the facility to which it was granted
is subject to a validation survey or not.

 Several commenters suggested that HCFA validation surveys be required to use the ``methods, procedures, and forms
prescribed for use by the survey agency.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The language used in the proposed rule (that HCFA conduct validation surveys ``using the HCFA protocol prescribed
for use by the survey agency'') was derived from sections 1819(g)(3)(A) and 1919(g)(3)(A) of the Act, which require
that the Secretary conduct validation surveys using ``the same survey protocols as the State is required to use *&blank;*&blank;*.''
We do not believe that there is any meaningful difference between the phraseology suggested by the commenter and that
used in the proposed rule.

the State survey findings until after the Federal survey.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 It is HCFA practice to meet with the State survey agency whenever possible if there is a significant difference of findings
between a State survey and the Federal validation survey. Often this is not possible because of time and travel constraints.
In these cases, we notify the State survey agency of the findings and begin discussions regarding the appropriate
enforcement remedy to apply. We agree with the commenter that a face to face meeting is the best practice. Current instructions
to Federal and State surveyors are to review all pertinent documents regarding the performance of the facility before
starting the survey. In practice, this review seldom covers the most recent State survey, because it is not available,
as these survey reports are not sent routinely to the HCFA regional offices. We appreciate the apparent concerns of
the commenter; however, it will be difficult to prevent Federal surveyors from seeing the most recent State report
at some time during the Federal survey because, in accordance with &sect;483.10(g)(1), survey results must be made
available in the facility. Despite the concerns of the commenter, we believe that the accuracy of the Federal survey
is not compromised by the knowledge of what the State findings were. In any case, the increased use of the OSPATS process
should reduce the concerns of both commenters.

 A few commenters said that validation surveys should be focused on State survey performance, not facility compliance.
Unless the HCFA survey discovers a serious threat to residents, the findings should be directed toward the State.
For egregious failures of State survey performance, HCFA should consider contracting with another professional
survey entity.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The primary purpose of the validation survey is to assess State survey performance. In the process, we do determine
facility compliance and must take action consistent with this information. Therefore, the validation survey can
result in actions against non-compliant facilities and against the State. Section 488.320 provides the sanctions
authorized by the Act to be imposed against the States.

failure to cite deficiencies. If the focus is on only the State's failure to cite deficiencies, it may lead State surveyors
to cite more deficiencies as a means of preventing Federal sanctions.

 We agree with this comment. The HCFA focus is now and will continue to be on the accuracy of the State survey. Part of that
focus is to alert the State survey agency to situations where State surveyors are failing to cite valid deficiencies.
We are aware of the possibility that some State surveyors might cite more deficiencies in order to avoid sanctions
against the State. We have no concrete evidence that any actually have done so. In any case, our education efforts,
including training on the ``Principles of Documentation,'' are directed to the writing of accurate, well documented
deficiencies. Well documented deficiencies are more likely to prompt corrective action and avoid unnecessary contentiousness
between providers and survey agencies than poorly documented deficiencies.

 One commenter said that HCFA should provide for two separate hearings because the deficiency determinations and
the remedies selected are based on two sets of facts. Other commenters said it would be better to have one hearing; either
State or Federal. One commenter suggested that the closer the validation survey was to the State survey, the easier
it would be to hold one hearing.

The Act is constructed so that a facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to a validation survey is entitled to only one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing, either State or Federal. The provisions at section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1919(h)(7) of the Act furnish the means for resolving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disagreements between HCFA and the State over whose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcement action will control, which in turn, determines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether the facility is entitled to a hearing under part 431 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or part 498. Moreover, HCFA excludes from the validation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sample any facility against which adverse action has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initiated by the State survey agency. Therefore, if HCFA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposes remedies against a provider on the basis of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance identified during a validation survey, HCFA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies are the only ones imposed, and the provider can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contest the determination of noncompliance leading to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcement remedy in one Federal hearing.

We monitor State agency survey performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primarily by reviewing State survey team findings and by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducting validation surveys. Sections 1819(g)(3) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1919(g)(3) of the Act, as added by sections 4202 and 4212 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OBRA '87, require the Secretary to conduct validation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveys of at least 5 percent of the SNFs and NFs in each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State that have been surveyed by the State survey agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(but in no case less than 5 facilities). Prior to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective date of OBRA '87, HCFA, acting for the Secretary, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitored State performance by conducting Federal monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveys. OBRA '87 formalizes this process. The validation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveys must be conducted within 2 months of the date of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State's surveys and must be of sufficient number to allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inferences about the adequacy of the State's surveys.

Several commenters said HCFA should sanction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual surveyors when they make erroneous findings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against facilities, whether the errors are intentional or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unintentional.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1864(a) of the Act authorizes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary to enter into agreements with State survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies to determine whether SNFs meet the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation requirements for Medicare. Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1902(a)(33)(B) of the Act provides for State survey agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to perform the same survey tasks for facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participating or seeking to participate in the Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program. HCFA assesses the performance of each State's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey and certification program annually, and &sect;488.320 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sets forth the sanctions that HCFA may impose upon the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States for inadequate survey performance. With respect to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanctions against individuals, we note that, with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exception of the relatively small number of HCFA staff who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perform validation surveys, surveyors are State agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personnel, appointed and paid by the State agency, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supervised by State managers. For these reasons, HCFA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considers that any corrective or disciplinary action is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State matter. Whenever HCFA validation surveys uncover 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
errors on the part of any individual State agency surveyor, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State is informed so it can take whatever action is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a final measure, formal mechanisms are in place 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which provide an opportunity for facilities to appeal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certifications of noncompliance that lead to enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies, except State monitoring.

Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HCFA monitors the accuracy of a State survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency's findings by performing validation surveys and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reviews. Accuracy means not only that the State team has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriately cited all the deficiencies that existed, but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also that it has not cited a deficiency when no violation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a requirement has occurred. HCFA conducts random surveys 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concurrently with the State surveys as well as independent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveys within 2 months of the States' surveys, and also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducts indepth reviews of selected State survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documentation. If HCFA discovers that a State is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systematically citing unfounded deficiencies, HCFA will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider there to be inadequate survey performance and may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply any of the sanctions provided for at &sect;488.320(b)(2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the proposed rule, Sanctions for Inadequate Survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Performance, in the case of Medicare facilities. In the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
case of Medicaid facilities, HCFA cannot reduce FFP as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified at &sect;488.170(b)(1)(i) of the proposed rule because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we have concluded that section 1919(g)(3)(C) of the Act does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not accommodate such action under this scenario. The two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terms of the FFP reduction formula at section 1919(g)(3)(C) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Act are: the total number of residents in nursing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities surveyed by HCFA during a quarter; and, the total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of residents in nursing facilities found pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA surveys to be noncompliant. The number of residents in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nursing facilities which HCFA found to be compliant but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the State determined were noncompliant does not figure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into the calculation; therefore, no FFP reduction can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taken when the form of the State survey inadequacy is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
citation of unfounded deficiencies, or indeed when the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inadequacy is anything other than the State's failure to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identify deficiencies. However, the Act does allow the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary to impose another sanction for the citation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unfounded deficiencies in Medicaid facilities. Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1919(g)(3) of the Act states that the Secretary may also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respond to inadequate State survey performance in Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities by providing for the training of the State's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey teams. We are amending &sect;488.320 of the regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to indicate this and to clarify that the citation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unfounded deficiencies will be considered inadequate survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance. An additional safeguard against the citation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of unfounded deficiencies will be afforded to facilities by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their opportunity to engage in informal dispute resolution, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as described in &sect;488.331.

Some commenters said that &sect;488.318 precluded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities from informally challenging or expressing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disagreement with survey findings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All States currently offer some opportunity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for providers to refute survey findings. In one State, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process is required by State law. It is State policy in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rest. Although these policies vary among States, they all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply to State surveys of Medicare and Medicaid providers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, HCFA's State Operations Manual requires that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States allow facilities to interact with the survey team 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the survey, to discuss findings at an exit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conference, to raise unresolved issues to the State survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency or the HCFA regional office, or both, and to record 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their disagreement on the HCFA&hyph;2567. If none of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
courses of action satisfy the provider, there are appeal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mechanisms available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, whenever possible, we want to provide every 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity to settle disagreements at the earliest stage, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before much time and money are spent by the provider, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State agency, and HCFA. Therefore, we are requiring, at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.331, that States offer an opportunity for informal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dispute resolution beginning with the provider's receipt of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the official statement of deficiencies. Although inadequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey performance will not invalidate adequately documented 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies, neither the State's inadequate performance nor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a resulting HCFA sanction imposed on the State will prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the facility from formally or informally challenging or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expressing disagreement with survey findings.

 We will not automatically consider any disparity between validation and State survey findings as inadequate survey
performance. For example, when Federal surveyors find a facility in compliance with a requirement that the State
cited as a deficiency, Federal surveyors are directed to go through a decision making process to determine if the disparity
is due to facility correction or a flaw of the State survey. When Federal surveyors find deficiencies that were not
previously cited by the State, we will consider whether the discrepancies can be explained by changed facility conditions
or by other case specific factors before concluding that State survey performance has been inadequate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One suggestion was that determinations of inadequate survey performance be based on a State agency's overall performance
rather than on isolated instances. Commenters believed that a pattern of noncompliance and noncorrection should
be established before HCFA concludes that there is inadequate survey performance, and that HCFA should only consider
State survey performance to be inadequate when the State ``substantially'' fails to perform as required. Others
requested that we consider there to be inadequate survey performance only when the State fails to identify serious
deficiencies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Sections 1819(g)(3)(C) and 1919(g)(3)(C) of the Act specify actions the Secretary may and must take if the State has
failed to perform surveys as required by the Act or if a State's survey and certification performance is otherwise
inadequate. Although the Act requires us to apply sanctions for inadequate survey performance, it gives us leeway
when it comes to determining what inadequate survey performance actually is. The Act does not specify the criteria
by which the Secretary is to make determinations of inadequate State performance, and does not obligate us to sanction
the State for every survey shortcoming. It would be inappropriate and unduly harsh to automatically consider any
failure by a State to cite a deficiency or to follow proper procedure to be inadequate survey performance. Rather,
we believe it would be preferable to reserve sanctions for States that demonstrate a pattern of failure to identify
deficiencies, or to follow proper procedure, or whose isolated oversights are particularly egregious. Changing
facility conditions may account for many of the discrepancies between Federal and State survey findings, and because
not every discrepancy or omission indicates systemic inadequate survey performance, not every one should cause
a State to automatically lose FFP or be subject to other sanctions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We reflect this policy in &sect;488.320. Guidelines for making determinations of inadequate survey performance
will be forthcoming in future manual instructions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As we stated in &sect;488.168(c) of the proposed rule (which has been redesignated as &sect;488.318(b) in this final
rule), ``Inadequate survey performance does not relieve a SNF or NF of its obligations to meet all requirements for
program participation, nor does it invalidate 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
adequately documented
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 deficiencies.'' (emphasis added) In other words, a flawed survey can still validly document one or many deficiencies;
the facility is still liable for sanctions where deficiencies, in fact, exist.

Some commenters asked if the State Agency Evaluation Program (SAEP) was going to be used to evaluate State survey agency
performance under this section. Certain commenters believe that it should be. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The SAEP is currently undergoing comprehensive evaluation. We do not know if the program, in its future form, will
be designed to identify performance problems of individual States for enforcement purposes, or whether the purpose
of the program will be more geared toward global evaluation of the State agency survey and certification process as
a whole. HCFA will, however, obtain information on the adequacy of State agency survey activity through validation
surveys and otherwise through its general oversight authority.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Certain commenters recommended that we limit determinations of inadequate survey performance to the OSPATS. It
was their view that it is unfair to reduce FFP based on a comparison of survey findings, as conditions in nursing homes
change daily. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As stated previously, we acknowledge that there are great advantages to conducting a validation survey concurrently
with the State's standard recertification survey, and it is our intent to expand the use of the OSPATS process for validation
surveys. However, we reiterate that it is necessary to continue to use nonconcurrent validation surveys, despite
the preference of the States and HCFA for OSPATS, because Federal surveyors must have at least one year of experience
surveying before they are eligible to conduct an OSPATS.

Some comments suggested the rules should state whether or not appeals under this section should stay the reduction
of FFP action.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1919(g)(3)(C) of the Act requires that appeals of sanctions under this rule are to be made according to section
1116 of the Act. According to section 1903(d)(5) of the Act, if an appeal of a disallowance is made, the State has the
option of retaining the funds disallowed pending a final administrative decision. If the final decision upholds
the disallowance and the State elected to retain the funds during the appeal process, the proper amount of the disallowance,
plus interest computed in accordance with &sect;488.442 will be offset in a subsequent grant award.

Some commenters complained that FFP reduction is an excessive measure, and suggested that FFP not be reduced as a sanction,
or be reduced only after other methods of addressing inadequate State agency performance have been tried and failed.
Other commenters asked that the same sanctions be imposed against the State for inadequate survey performance regardless
of whether the inadequately surveyed facilities participate in Medicare or Medicaid. An additional commenter recommended
that we levy financial penalties against the survey agency instead of reducing FFP to the State.

While we appreciate the merits of these suggestions, section 1919(g)(3)(C) of the Act does not give us such flexibility.
Rather, it requires that, when HCFA finds, on the basis of validation surveys that the State has inadequately surveyed
Medicaid nursing facilities, HCFA may provide for training of State survey teams, but shall provide for a reduction
of FFP according to a prescribed formula.

However, the FFP reduction formula specified at section 1919(g)(3)(C) of the Act and at &sect;488.170(c) of the proposed
rule has certain limitations: it cannot be used to sanction a State when it has cited unfounded deficiencies or when
its survey findings are appropriate but its survey scheduling, team composition or other practices are unacceptable.
However, these survey defects are no less serious than a failure to identify deficiencies, and it is unlikely that
the Congress intended for us to disregard them. HCFA does have the authority to provide for the training of survey teams
in these instances. We are revising &sect;488.320(b)(2) to provide that when the State's survey performance in Medicaid
facilities is inadequate but the inadequacy is not accommodated by the FFP reduction formula, HCFA will provide for
the training of State survey teams. In addition, HCFA has the authority to consider the Medicaid provider agreement
to be invalid for failure to follow proper survey procedures, and may invoke the FFP disallowance provision at &sect;442.30,
Agreement as evidence of certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are unable to make the sanctions for inadequate survey performance parallel across facility type as commenters
suggested. As discussed above, the Act does not permit us to eliminate FFP reduction as a sanction for inadequate survey
performance in Medicaid facilities, and neither does it allow us to expand the application of this sanction to inadequate
survey performance in Medicare facilities. The conspicuous absence of Federal payment reduction in section 1819(g)(3)(C)
of the Act, which lists sanctions for inadequate survey performance in Medicare facilities, as opposed to the inclusion
of FFP reduction in section 1919(g)(3)(C), which specifies sanctions for inadequate performance in Medicaid facilities,
is a clear indication that the Congress intended to restrict Federal payment reduction for inadequate survey performance
in Medicaid facilities alone. Likewise, section 1819(g)(3)(C) gives us the flexibility to devise our own sanctions
for inadequate survey performance in Medicare facilities, but no comparable authority exists in section 1919(g)(3)(C).
Therefore, we must assume that the Congress did not intend for us to impose sanctions other than the two specified in
the statute for inadequate survey performance in Medicaid facilities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A few commenters suggested that &sect;488.325(a)(1) be expanded to require that the scope and severity levels of
all deficiencies, including those deficiencies with a scope and severity level of 1, be recorded on and, therefore
disclosable as part of, the official deficiency statement, in an effort to promote facility competition and quality.
Some of these commenters argue that we must disclose notice of all deficiencies, regardless of scope and severity
level, if we are to provide the public with a complete and accurate report of a facility's current compliance status.
Some propose that another requirement be added under &sect;488.325(a) to read: ``(9) The summary of 1&hyph;1 deficiencies.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As discussed later in this preamble, we are revising the scheme that appeared in the proposed rule by eliminating scope
and severity scales, as such, and by substituting instead a scheme in which HCFA and the State will assess deficiencies
by application of several factors that will gear enforcement remedies to the seriousness of noncompliance at facilities.
However, we are accepting the second comment with some modification. With the exception of isolated deficiencies
that HCFA or the State determines constitute no actual harm with a potential for only minimal harm, all deficiencies
will be recorded on the HCFA&hyph;2567. Those isolated deficiencies will not be recorded on the official deficiency
statement, but will be recorded on a separate document as discussed in the preamble of the proposed rule. However,
all of a facility's deficiencies, including those deficiencies that HCFA or the State determines constitute no actual
harm with potential for minimal harm, will be disclosable. We are revising &sect;488.325(a)(2) to require the release
of the summary of isolated deficiencies that HCFA or the State determines constitute no actual harm with potential
for minimal harm deficiencies.

 One commenter asked how this information will be disclosed to the public and also wanted to know if facilities have
any responsibility relative to disclosure. The same commenter wasn't sure what we meant by ``direct or indirect interest
in a SNF or NF'' as used at &sect;488.325(a) (7) and (8).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Existing procedural requirements at &sect;&sect;401.133&hyph;136 and 431.115 as well as sections 3300&hyph;3320
in the State Operations Manual remain in effect relative to public disclosure of Medicare and Medicaid survey documents,
respectively. While &sect;431.115 provides only minimum disclosure requirements for States, it directs that States
have a procedure for disclosing the specified survey information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 1819(g)(5) and 1919(g)(5) of the Act provide the statutory bases for &sect;488.325 regarding disclosure
of inspection and other information on SNFs and NFs by the States and HCFA. The only requirement we are imposing on nursing
home providers in this regard is that, not later than 10 working days after receiving a notice of substandard quality
of care, a SNF or a NF must provide the State with a list of each resident in the facility and the name and address of his
or her attending physician. Failure of the facility to disclose the information timely will result in termination
or alternative remedies being imposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to an administrative oversight, the word ``ownership'' was omitted from the proposed regulation text at proposed
&sect;488.175(a) (7) and (8), clarifying ``direct or indirect interest.'' We are revising both cites, which have
been redesignated as &sect;488.325(a) (8) and (9), respectively, to specify ``ownership'' interest. We are also
cross-referring these cites to &sect;420.201, which defines ``direct'' and ``indirect'' ownership interest.

 Several commenters suggested that results of complaint surveys be disclosable under this subpart.

Response:

 The regulation implementing sections 1819(g)(5) and 1919(g)(5) of the Act provides that information must be made
available by the State or HCFA for all surveys and certifications. Therefore, information from any survey, including
a complaint survey, is disclosable under this subpart.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We received four distinct comments on &sect;488.325(b), which concerns charges associated with making information
available. First, some commenters believe that, while charges should be permitted, they should not be required,
nor should they, when imposed, exceed the amount facilities charge residents for copies of records. They proposed
that the requirement to follow 42 CFR 401.140 regarding fees and charges be reduced to a suggestion by changing the
word ``will'' to ``may.'' Second, other commenters contended that &sect;401.140 is outdated, too restrictive,
and in conflict with some States' Freedom of Information laws. Since many States have adopted their own fee schedule,
they suggested that this provision be revised to permit States to use their own fee schedule. Third, one commenter
questioned HCFA's authority to require States to impose any charges. Lastly, some commenters proposed that the regulation
allow for waiver of fees or reduced fees so that survey information is truly accessible to all. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are not accepting the suggestion that fees imposed by HCFA or the States relative to disclosure parallel those charged
by facilities to residents because we have no basis to develop a provider-specific disclosure policy relative to
fees. However, since &sect;431.115(d) requires only that the Medicaid agency ``have a procedure for disclosing
pertinent findings obtained from surveys made by the State survey agency,'' and since we understand that most, if
not all, States have their own fee schedules, we are amending this subsection to allow, but not require, States to use
their respective fee schedules for documents which they maintain and which they have been asked to disclose. In response
to the comments that fees be permissible but not required, as well as the request for a fee exception clause, we refer
the commenters to &sect;401.140(c), which provides for waiver or reduction of fees for Medicare. That section discusses
when a waiver of fees and charges would be appropriate and permissible; States are free to use any such waiver provisions
within their respective disclosure procedures in the same way that they are free to use or not use a fee schedule at all.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Numerous commenters were strongly opposed to allowing oral requests for information. Some say that this is clearly
inconsistent with past practice which has generally been that requests be in writing. This claim is further substantiated
by the Freedom of Information Act which provides that all agencies generally stipulate that requests for information
be in writing. Some commenters say that only written requests can substantiate specific charges and fees, while others,
specifically States, use the written requests as a record of the distribution of information which is used for workload
and expenditure reporting, as well as for other administrative purposes.

Since publishing the proposed rule, we have concluded that it is not necessary to create a facility-specific requirement
relative to the method by which requests for survey information should be made, and we are revising &sect;488.325(c)
to provide that such requests are to be made in accordance with the Department of Health and Human Services' regulations
relative to disclosure at 45 CFR Part 5, in other words, generally in writing.

Many commenters suggested that paragraph (d)(3) be expanded to include providers' responses in order to be consistent

With the exception of those isolated deficiencies that HCFA or the State determines constitute no actual harm with
potential for minimal harm, which are recorded on a separate form and which can be refuted by providers during the dispute
resolution process, any provider response to the deficiency statement itself would be noted on the plan of correction
(both of which are explicitly releasable under the Freedom of Information Act), we are making explicit in &sect;488.325(d)
that provider responses to the deficiency statements are disclosable.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters believed that States and facilities should be required to provide information immediately, especially
when State law or policy provides immediate access. Commenters also wanted to know whose disclosure provisions apply
(HCFA's or the State's) when there is a difference about what is releasable and when. A few commenters asked us to specify
whether the 10 days referred to in paragraphs (d) (1) and (2) are calendar or working days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As we have stated above, we have no basis to require facilities to disclose any information other than that which is
statutorily mandated. OBRA '90 provided that each State and the Secretary (HCFA), must make available to the public
information concerning all surveys and certifications of NFs and SNFs, including statements of deficiencies, and
approved plans of correction, within 14 calendar days after such information is made available to those facilities.
For procedures relative to release of information not included in the OBRA '90 provision, HCFA or the State should
defer to &sect;401.136 or State procedures, respectively. Also, we note that &sect;488.325(d) implements sections
4008(h)(2)(M) and 4801(e)(14) of OBRA '90, which require release of information by HCFA and the States, respectively,
not by providers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since paragraphs (d) (1) and (2) of the proposed rule offered no additional guidance to HCFA or the States beyond what
is currently at &sect;401.136 or in State procedures, respectively, we are deleting them. However, we are clarifying
the 10-day timeframe at &sect;401.136 as ``working'' days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The question of whose regulations prevail when disclosure requirements differ between HCFA and the State should
not arise since the State and Federal disclosure systems operate separately from one another. It is possible that
the same document could be releasable under a State's disclosure laws yet not be releasable under Federal law, or vice
versa. It is also possible that a disclosable document may be released by HCFA and the State subject to different disclosure
timeframes. In other words, documents maintained by Federal agencies are subject to Federal regulations; those
maintained by the State are subject to the State's regulations.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few commenters requested clarification regarding the 14 calendar days referenced in paragraphs (d)(3). They weren't
sure whether there was a single release of information that would occur 14 calendar days after some event, or whether
more than one release of information, each after 14 calendar days, was contemplated. Another commenter wanted to
know if the statement of deficiencies and plan of correction are a single document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While the statement of deficiencies and the plan of correction are recorded on the same form (Statement of Deficiencies
and Plan of Correction, Form HCFA&hyph;2567), the completion and disclosure of each is separate, not concurrent.
The deficiency statement, as well as the separate sheet transmitting survey findings of isolated deficiencies which
constitute no actual harm with potential for minimal harm, are notices that the certifying agency gives to a provider
transmitting its official survey findings. We have concluded that, since the separate listing of a facility's isolated
deficiencies which constitute no actual harm with a potential for minimal harm supplements the official deficiency
statement, the listing must be disclosed along with the official statement of deficiencies if we are to provide the
public with an accurate and complete report of that facility's compliance status. This information is disclosable
within 14 calendar days after it is made available to the provider. Upon receipt of the statement of deficiencies,
the provider responds, on the same form, with its plan and timetable for correction of cited deficiencies, as well
as any disagreement with the survey findings. Sections 1819(h)(2)(C) and 1919(h)(3)(D) of the Act require that a
plan and timetable for corrective action be approved by HCFA if alternative remedies are the only remedies being sought,
and if the facility is to continue to participate with deficiencies that do not constitute immediate jeopardy in either
or both the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Information about the plan of correction must be released to the public,
upon request, within 14 calendar days after the provider is notified of the approval status of its plan. Therefore,
each part, that is, the deficiency statement and the plan of correction, is releasable within 14 calendar days after
the provider's notification of that part.

 We are accepting the first suggestion and are revising redesignated paragraph (f)(4), to provide that the State must
provide the State's long term care ombudsman with requests for appeals and results of appeals. We are not accepting
the second suggestion. The fact that the Congress explicitly provided that a facility's Medicare and Medicaid cost
reports are disclosable to the public in accordance with applicable disclosure laws, and not routinely disseminated
to any specific party, demonstrates its intention that release of these reports should be based on the requestor's
right to know the information. The State's long-term care ombudsman, as well as any other member of the public, may
request these cost reports, surveyors' notes, and any other survey-related documents not included in this subsection
through the appropriate disclosure mechanism, for example, the Freedom of Information Act, where they will be evaluated
accordingly.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Many commenters, mostly State agencies, were opposed to routinely providing ombudsmen with the information required
by this subsection. They contend that this results in a costly and overwhelming task especially in the larger States;
for example, California has 1300 nursing homes and 42 ombudsman field offices. They propose that a more reasonable
approach to notification would be that in cases where a specified degree of noncompliance exists, for example, substandard
care, notification would be automatic; in all other cases, notification would be upon request. Another comment was
that HCFA should develop a report using data from current reporting systems to provide the needed information.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We cannot accept these suggestions. Sections 1819(g)(5)(B) and 1919(g)(5)(B) of the Act, as amended by sections
4008(h)(2)(N) and 4801(e)(15) of OBRA '90, specifically provide, without exception, that ``States'' will notify
``the State long-term care ombudsman'' of a State finding of noncompliance with ``any'' participation requirement
as well as of ``any'' adverse action imposed against a facility in that State. Regarding the number of ombudsmen offices
within a State to which notifications must be made, we note that, since the statutory requirement to notify ``the State
long-term care ombudsman'' is singular, the State's central long-term care ombudsman office within each State's
organizational structure is the intended contact point for satisfying such notification requirements. While we
see the function of disseminating the information further among the district and other ombudsmen offices to be the
responsibility of the State's central long-term care ombudsman office, each State has the flexibility to design
its own system.

 A few commenters wanted HCFA or the State to notify the ombudsman of a nurse staffing waiver within 7 days of its approval.
Several commenters proposed that notice of nurse staffing waivers be provided to prospective residents, their physicians,
families or legal representatives, the State licensure board for nursing and the State and local medical societies.
They based their proposal on the public's need to know, not only from a consumer's perspective, but as taxpayers who
directly subsidize the affected facilities.

Since publishing the proposed rule, we found that disclosure of nurse staffing waivers is addressed in regulations
at 42 CFR 483.30. Also, since sections 1819(g)(5)(C) and 1919(g)(5)(C) of the Act are clear as to the individuals and
organizations that would have the greatest need for specified survey-related information, we believe that all interests
have been adequately represented and that such information is easily accessible to any other interested parties
either through their respective professional affiliations, or through the public disclosure mechanism. Therefore,
we are eliminating notifications specific to nurse staffing waivers from this final rule.

We are not accepting this comment. We believe we must retain this provision since this final rule provides HCFA's and
the State's enforcement strategy when facilities do not substantially meet the nursing home participation requirements
which are codified at 42 CFR Part 483, Subpart B. The requirement that facilities provide information to the State
relative to specified residents so that the State can meet its statutory obligation to notify attending physicians
and licensing boards is in addition to the other participation requirements at Part 483, Subpart B, and we believe
that consequences for facility noncompliance with this requirement are noteworthy.

Many commenters were opposed to our proposal implementing sections 1819(g)(5)(C)(i) and 1919(g)(5)(C)(i) of the
Act regarding notice to physicians when the State finds that a nursing home has provided substandard quality of care.
All of these commenters objected to the requirement that the attending physician of each Medicare and Medicaid resident
receive notification of the substandard quality of care. Some believed that physicians of all residents in the facility
should be notified when such care is found because they contend that all residents are vulnerable to such care and a
program relationship should not need to exist before notifications occur. An equal number of commenters argued that
this subsection exceeds the statutory requirement that provides for notification of ``*&blank;*&blank;* the attending
physician of each resident with respect to which such finding is made *&blank;*&blank;*''. These commenters suggested
that the purpose of the statutory requirement was to ensure that the physician of a resident who has allegedly received
substandard quality of care is apprised of the situation in order to ensure appropriate medical interventions, if
needed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are adopting a modified version of the above suggestions and are requiring that the physician of each resident in
the facility who was found to have suffered substandard quality of care, regardless of payment source, be notified
of findings of substandard quality of care. Findings of substandard quality of care are indicative of the facility's
inability or unwillingness to meet specific participation requirements relative to the entire resident population.
While we have the statutory responsibility to ensure the safety and well-being of program beneficiaries and recipients
in nursing homes that participate in one or both programs, noncompliance frequently affects residents in a facility,
other than just Medicare and Medicaid residents. Moreover, the Act plainly applies to all residents receiving substandard
quality of care regardless of payment source. Therefore, findings of substandard quality of care must be communicated
to the physician of each resident who was the subject of such care.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A few commenters suggested that notification to the State board responsible for the licensing of the facility administrator
be limited to those situations where the administrator is found culpable for the violations identified. They describe
situations in which a reputable administrator is recruited to a problem facility in an effort to turn the facility
around. Shortly thereafter, a survey is performed which identifies substandard quality of care, and as a result,
the newly hired administrator is reported to the licensing board. They point out that this situation provides a disincentive
for quality administrators to assume control of problem facilities due to the risk to their reputation. A few commenters
wondered why licensing boards need to be notified, while others believed that notification should be expanded to
include State licensure boards for nursing and medicine as well as the State and local medical societies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are not accepting these suggestions. First, the requirements to notify the licensing board, as well as physicians
of Medicare and Medicaid residents, when substandard quality of care is identified, are statutory and do not provide
for exceptions. Second, a facility administrator, regardless of recency of appointment, is ultimately accountable
for the care and services provided in his or her facility at the time of the survey. We would expect that this consideration
as well as others would be evaluated by a prospective facility administrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the comment that notification should be expanded, sections 1819(g)(5)(C) and 1919(g)(5)(C) of the Act
are clear as to the individuals and organizations that would have the greatest need for the specified survey-related
information. We believe that all interests have been adequately represented and that such information is easily
accessible to any other interested parties either through their respective professional affiliations, or through
the public disclosure mechanism. Therefore, we see no need to expand the list of parties the State must notify about
substandard quality of care.

 States will provide the notification regardless of who performed the survey that identified the substandard quality
of care. For all State-operated facilities, as well as non-State-operated facilities which are subject to a Federal
survey, HCFA will notify the State of the finding of substandard quality of care so that the State can fulfill the notification
requirements. This requirement is based on the rationale that the State ``finds'' noncompliance when it is notified
of it by HCFA. This approach permits use of existing State systems and centralizes notification efforts.

 Some commenters complained that in cases where the facility fails to provide the list of residents and their physicians
required in proposed &sect;488.175(h) (redesignated in this rule as paragraph &sect;488.325(g)), the State will
be unable to comply with the State notification requirements in proposed paragraph (i) (redesignated in this rule
as paragraph (h)). If the facility provides the list late, the State will miss its 30-day deadline. These commenters
believe that this paragraph should be rewritten to require the State to issue notice within 30 calendar days of receipt
of the resident/physician information from the facility.

 The Act does not require revisits, appeals or any other pre-notification activity prior to notification to physicians
and licensing boards. If the facility does manage to correct the deficiencies designated as substandard quality
of care and have the correction substantiated by State or Federal surveyors before the notification, that notification
should indicate that corrections have been made. However, the Act is clear that physicians and licensing boards are
to be notified when the facility has provided substandard quality of care. Therefore, substandard quality of care
provided before corrective action was taken, still must be reported.

and licensing board. These commenters also asked what becomes of this information.

 There is no statutory basis for notifying physicians more than once about a facility's compliance status. However,
there is nothing to preclude facilities, physicians, or licensing boards from following up on this matter absent
a statutory or regulatory requirement. Physicians are free to initiate inquiries into this matter, just as facilities
are free to contact physicians and licensing boards about corrective action having occurred after the initial notification
by the State.

While the notification in and of itself is not appealable, providers may appeal, in accordance with parts 431 or 498,
as applicable, a finding of noncompliance that caused a remedy or remedies to be imposed. However, there is no statutory
basis to require that results of provider appeals be communicated to the physicians and licensing board previously
notified of the substandard quality of care. Again, the providers are free to notify physicians and licensing boards
about the outcomes of these appeals and physicians and licensing boards are free to inquire about such matters.

We cannot accept this suggestion. Section 1819(h)(2) of the Act requires the Secretary to take certain enforcement
actions when the Secretary finds either through his or her own survey, or through the State's survey, that a SNF no longer
meets the requirements set forth in section 1819(b), (c) or (d) of the Act. Thus, we do not have the authority to delegate
the enforcement authority for SNFs to the State.

Response:

To the extent possible, we have attempted to use the survey and certification process in effect before October 1, 1990,
whereby the survey agency would conduct the survey and certify compliance or noncompliance with Federal requirements,
subject to HCFA approval as necessary for SNFs. The OBRA '87 legislation made a distinction between State operated
and non-State operated facilities. Specifically, OBRA '87 provided that the Secretary would be responsible for
certifying State-operated facilities. To be as consistent as possible with our present survey process, we proposed
that the State survey agency would conduct all surveys (with the exception of validation surveys). We believe that
requiring survey agencies to survey all facilities will make surveys for all nursing homes in a State more consistent
since the same entity will conduct all surveys. However, HCFA would maintain the certification responsibility,
thus assuring oversight as envisioned by the Act.

The Secretary's finding of noncompliance during a validation survey would not be counted toward three consecutive
findings of substandard quality of care. Sections 1819(h)(2)(E) and 1919(h)(2)(D) of the Act refer to facilities
being found to have provided substandard care under three consecutive standard surveys conducted under sections
1819(g)(2) and 1919(g)(2) of the Act, respectively. Sections 1819(g)(2) and 1919(g)(2) of the Act describe the State's

 Many commenters believe that HCFA's proposal ignores the concept of substantial compliance because the proposed
regulations define any failure to comply with the regulations as a deficiency. The commenters suggest that the regulation
be rewritten to state that facilities will be judged on substantial compliance. A few commenters asked if a deficiency
with a scope of 1 and a severity of 1 would constitute noncompliance that is sufficient to exclude a prospective provider
from program participation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After carefully considering the matter, we are accepting the commenters' suggestion to incorporate the concept
of substantial compliance in the regulation as the standard that prospective providers and existing providers must
meet in order to begin or continue to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. We arrived at this conclusion
for several reasons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on public comments and further consideration on our part, we believe that the notion of perfect compliance,
as discussed in the proposed rule, is an impractical and, perhaps, unrealistic standard for providers or prospective
providers to meet. This is because in lieu of approximately 15 statutory requirements with which facilities had to
comply before OBRA '87, the Act now sets forth more than 100 requirements that facilities have to meet in order to participate
in the Medicare or Medicaid programs. In fact, in 1992 only 7.3 percent of all nursing homes surveyed were deficiency-free.
Under a regulatory system defined by condition and standard level requirements, such as the system in place for many
years, we found that almost all facilities that were experiencing only minor problems did retain program eligibility
since the system allowed for some noncompliance at the standard level. That is no longer the case. By vastly increasing
the number of statutory requirements that facilities have to meet in order to meet the statutory definition of a SNF
or NF, and by directing the Department to do away with its former hierarchy of requirements, the Congress made it far
more difficult for facilities to meet prerequisites for program participation. As discussed above, however, we
do not believe that the Congress intended to write into law a set of requirements that would eliminate almost all providers
from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Accordingly, we have drawn upon the principles enunciated by the Institute
of Medicine in its study of nursing home regulation that helped spawn nursing home reform. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A benchmark of the IoM study was its conclusion that the focus of nursing home regulation should be on resident outcomes
and not procedural requirements that do not always accurately measure whether quality care is being rendered. Sections
1819 and 1919 of the Act, and the implementing regulations at 42 CFR Part 483, as well as our survey process, reflect
this focus. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe that the Act sets forth many examples of requirements which, if violated by a facility, would not necessarily
expose a resident to the potential for anything more than minimal harm, much less actual harm. For example, &sect;1919(b)(3)(C)
requires that a facility conduct a resident assessment for each individual no later than 14 days after admission.
If a facility were to conduct almost all of its assessments in compliance with this requirement, but failed in the case
of only one resident who was assessed on the 15th day after admission, a very narrow reading of the statute would compel
a conclusion that the facility was out of compliance and thereby failed to meet the statutory definition of a nursing
facility under &sect;1919(a) of the Act. This kind of approach to nursing home regulation, as we alluded to above,
would be unduly harsh and impractical where the facility's failure did not expose the resident to any harm. Indeed,
it may be the case that the facility prepared an exemplary assessment for the one resident for whom it acted untimely.
The same type of analysis could be made for violations of the requirement at &sect;1919(c)(2)(B) regarding the requirement
to be given at least 30 days in advance notice of a resident's transfer. Where in a given case, a facility gives 29 days
advance notice, the question might better be, was there a potential for minimal harm as a result of this infraction
rather than conclude that the Act was violated and expose the facility to one or more remedies, even where the resident
experienced no more than the potential for minimal harm.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly, we are defining ``substantial compliance'' at &sect;488.301 as a level of compliance with requirements
of participation such that any identified deficiencies pose no greater risk to patient health and safety than the
potential for causing minimal harm. Thus, while a facility may avoid a remedy even if it fails to comply perfectly with
all statutory requirements, it still has a duty to each resident to provide care that enhances the chances of positive
outcomes and avoids negative outcomes. If a single resident experiences any harm, a facility will not have satisfied
its statutory obligations. Given the statute's focus on each resident's right to receive quality care, and the facility's
mirrored obligation to provide it, we believe that we could not adopt a less rigorous standard of compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We acknowledge that there might be many definitions that we could have chosen from, but in our view the definition we
have settled upon strikes the appropriate balance that best implements the statute, the IoM study, and accommodates
both facility and resident concerns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, as commenters suggested, we considered the fact that section 1866(b)(2) of the Act allows the Secretary to
enter into provider agreements with facilities that ``substantially'' meet applicable requirements. Although
there is no analogous provision in the Medicaid law for nursing facilities, we are exercising our general rulemaking
authority in section 1102 of the Act, to extend the ``substantiality'' concept to Medicaid providers. We believe
that since Congress stressed that it intended to adopt the IoM recommendation that the same requirements apply to
both Medicare and Medicaid facilities, it is logical to recognize substantial compliance as an acceptable standard
to meet for participation in both programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As we discuss in more detail later in this preamble, the scope and severity gradations that appeared in the proposed
rule will only serve as one example of how States can determine remedies. Furthermore, we are removing the numerical
designations from the scope and severity measure. In response to the commenter who asked if a deficiency at a scope
of 1 and a severity of 1 would constitute noncompliance sufficient enough to exclude a prospective provider from program
participation, the answer is no. While we are not mandating the use of numerical ranges, if States use such ranges,
and if a 1/1 designation denotes a deficiency which is of limited scope and which has caused no harm and is unlikely to
cause more than minimal harm, a facility with such a deficiency would not be precluded from participating in the Medicare
or Medicaid program.

Several commenters raised concerns with the provision that facilities must meet all requirements because they wonder
how many follow-up surveys will be necessary to ascertain that a facility is in full compliance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As we discussed earlier, we reconsidered our position spelled out in the proposed rule that prospective providers
had to comply perfectly with all requirements to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Instead, we are
requiring that providers and prospective providers be in substantial compliance with all requirements in order
to participate in both programs. If a State survey agency is requested to conduct more than one initial survey of a prospective
provider because it was not in substantial compliance, the State survey agency will have the flexibility to conduct
follow-up surveys up to three weeks after the facility alleges correction of the noncompliance that disqualified
it from Medicare and/or Medicaid participation. This is consistent with section 2008 of the State Operations Manual
which established 3 weeks as the timeframe in which the State should conduct an initial survey of a prospective provider
after its notification of full operation. The 3-week interval is necessary to allow the State survey agency adequate
time to schedule a revisit, and gives the prospective provider who has corrected noncompliance the opportunity to
demonstrate that it is capable of continued substantial compliance.

We accept this suggestion, but only with regard to the denial of payment and State monitor sanctions imposed for repeated
substandard quality of care, as specified at sections 1819(h)(2)(E) and 1919(h)(2)(D) of the Act, and for the imposition
of temporary management as specified at sections 1819(h)(2)(B)(iii), 1919(h)(2)(A)(iii), and 1919(h)(3)(C)(iii)
of the Act. Sections 1819(h)(2)(E) and 1919(h)(2)(D) of the Act provide that, if the State or Secretary finds substandard
quality of care on three consecutive standard surveys, the State or the Secretary must impose a denial of payment remedy
and monitor the facility until the facility has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Secretary or State that it
is in compliance with the requirements of sections 1819 (b), (c), and (d) and 1919 (b), (c), and (d), and that it will
remain in compliance with such requirements. Likewise sections 1819(h)(2)(B)(iii), 1919(h)(2)(B)(iii) and 1919(h)(3)(C)(iii)
of the Act specify that temporary management must not be lifted until the Secretary or State has determined that the
facility has the management capacity to ensure continued compliance with all the requirements of sections 1819 (b),
(c), and (d) and 1919 (b), (c), and (d) of the Act. We are, as explained earlier in this preamble, imposing a substantial
compliance standard for the purpose of imposing and lifting sanctions. Therefore, for the above mentioned remedies,
we are requiring that the remedies be lifted when the facility achieves substantial compliance and the facility has
demonstrated to the Secretary or the State that substantial compliance can be maintained. There is no statutory authority
for the continuation of any other remedies past the date that a facility achieves substantial compliance. We are making
changes to &sect;488.330(b)(2)(ii) accordingly and corresponding changes to proposed &sect;488.236 (redesignated
as &sect;488.454).

 A few commenters recommended amending the proposed text to provide that a facility that is certified meets all Federal
requirements, except that a facility may be considered to meet the requirements if it has requested and been granted
a waiver by either HCFA or the State survey agency. Commenters further requested that we clarify in the regulation
that once a waiver is granted, the existing situation which required the waiver is not considered a deficiency for
the purpose of remedies or repeat deficiencies.

 We do not believe the regulation needs to be changed. Waiving requirements renders those requirements not applicable
to a particular facility for the duration of the waiver. If requirements are not applicable to a particular facility,
that facility cannot be out of compliance with those requirements. Therefore, when a facility has been granted a waiver
of certain requirements, there would be no remedies imposed nor would those waived requirements be considered when
looking at a pattern of repeated noncompliance.

 Some State commenters believed that the proposed rule was unclear about when the certification of compliance or noncompliance
would be issued. For example, in the case of a plan of correction, would HCFA or the State certify compliance after an
acceptable plan of correction was received or would noncompliance be certified, and after successful completion
of the plan of correction, a subsequent certification of compliance be issued.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The certification of compliance or noncompliance is issued by the State survey agency approximately 20 to 25 days
after the last day of the survey. A finding of substantial compliance is considered within the range of compliance
and would receive a certification of compliance. A certification of compliance would be issued after a certification
of noncompliance if, as in the example the commenter offers, a facility submits a plan of correction and achieves substantial
compliance. The exact mechanism by which the facility will be notified of the subsequent certification of compliance
will be specified in manual instructions.

 One commenter suggested that HCFA not terminate a Medicaid provider agreement based on a validation survey unless
there is immediate jeopardy to resident health and safety.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We continue to believe that there is ample authority in the Act for the Secretary to terminate Medicaid provider agreements
in situations that do not pose immediate jeopardy. First, section 1919(h)(3)(B) of the Act provides that ``[n]othing
in this subparagraph shall be construed as restricting the remedies available to the Secretary to remedy a facility's
deficiencies.'' Second, section 1919(h)(3)(C) of the Act provides that the Secretary may provide for other specified
remedies. We view these provisions as statutory authority and Congressional intent that the Secretary design enforcement
remedies that will assist in effectively assuring prompt and lasting compliance by nursing facilities that serve
the Medicaid population. Third, the Act already expressly provides for terminations by the Secretary in non-immediate
jeopardy cases. Specifically, sections 1919(h)(6) and 1919(h)(7) of the Act, by their own terms, apply to findings
of noncompliance by the Secretary when there is no immediate jeopardy to resident health and safety. Each of these
provisions speaks to actions of the Secretary to terminate the provider agreement of such facilities. Accordingly,
we are not accepting the commenter's suggestion.

 A few commenters recommended that we revise &sect;488.330(d)(1) to remove ``nature of noncompliance'' and replace
it with ``basis for the determination.'' The commenters suggested that the word ``nature'' was not specific enough
and does not furnish the provider with the necessary information to formulate an appropriate plan of correction or
response to deny the allegation. Some commenters further suggested that the facility should be provided with full
information that supports each citation and the survey agency's decisions including the underlying reason, basis
or rationale for the findings of noncompliance with a regulatory requirement.

 We are not accepting this suggestion because we believe that the Statement of Deficiencies and Plan of Correction
Form (HCFA&hyph;2567) provide facilities with the specific information necessary to formulate an acceptable plan
of correction. To include such detailed information regarding deficiencies in the notice of noncompliance would
be duplicative and administratively burdensome. We also are not accepting the suggestion to replace ``nature of
noncompliance'' with ``basis for the determination'' because we believe there is virtually no substantive difference.

 Many commenters supported our proposal to impose remedies prior to the hearing, and noted that from the perspective
of the residents and their families this proposal is a strength of the proposed rules. These commenters approved of
applying remedies once the violations are found. Consumer groups emphasized that imposing remedies prior to appeals
is essential to carrying out the statutory requirement to ``minimize the time between identification of violations
and the final imposition of remedies''. They also commented that the IoM report expressed a similar view, stating
that HCFA ``should develop regulations that would allow states to implement sanctions prior to hearings and appeals.''
Many commenters stressed that delays in enforcement could harm the residents, and that remedies should not be delayed
pending a hearing. One consumer group noted that immediately imposing a restriction on admissions while a hearing
is pending is particularly effective.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters were concerned that providing hearings only after imposition of remedies denied providers their
rights to due process. Many commenters recognized that in cases of immediate jeopardy to resident health or safety,
pre-hearings were not necessary, but in cases in which there is no immediate jeopardy, they favored a hearing prior
to imposition of any sanctions. Some commenters wanted HCFA to require the States to give an informal hearing prior
to imposition of alternative remedies if the deficiencies do not pose immediate jeopardy to resident health or safety.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters recognized that the majority of courts that have addressed the issue have found that providers are
not constitutionally entitled to pre-hearing relief, but that a minority of courts have found that hardships are
imposed on providers and residents when no pre-termination process is afforded. These minority-view courts have
found facilities entitled to a pre-termination hearing on due process grounds when no pre-termination procedures
are available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters challenged HCFA's reliance on the court cases which have upheld post-termination hearings on the
grounds that these cases involved deficiencies analogous to immediate jeopardy situations. These commenters concede
that in immediate jeopardy situations, the residents' interests are compelling enough to permit post-termination
relief to providers, but not otherwise.

Several providers noted that residents could suffer transfer trauma, the facility's business could be destroyed,
and facility employees could lose their jobs, none of which could be restored if the facility were ultimately successful
on appeal. A few commenters noted that a prior hearing is often the only safeguard against a mistake or incorrect judgment
of a less experienced surveyor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few people commented that when penalties become incrementally more severe for repeated non-compliance, and imposition
of penalties takes into account a facility's compliance history, the need for hearings becomes more critical.

We believe that post-sanction hearings are entirely compatible with due process. Courts that have addressed this
issue have concluded that, because the facility has numerous opportunities to prevent mistakes from occurring and
to present its side of the story both during the survey process, at the exit interview, and by submitting written statements
and a plan of correction, due process is satisfied by the availability of post-sanction hearings. See, for example

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
434 U.S. 319 (1976), we have concluded, first and foremost, that the private interest that facilities have in their
continued participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs must give way to the Government's interest in protecting
the health and safety of the resident population. Additionally, in light of the opportunities available to providers
to question the accuracy of survey findings at various points during the survey process including during the survey,
exit conference, and through informal meetings with State or Federal officials, we believe that the chances for an
erroneous deprivation are quite small when compared to the enormous delay in the correction of noncompliance that
could occur were hearings to be routinely held prior to the institution of remedies. The use of an informal dispute
resolution process, to be discussed later in this preamble, should serve to reduce even further the chances of an erroneous
deprivation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Apart from the support of case law, the nursing home reform statutory provisions clearly reflect the desire expressed
in the enactment's legislative history that remedies be applied swiftly once deficiencies are identified. Specifically,
sections 1919(h)(2)(A) and (h)(3)(C) of the Act require that when States and the Secretary develop criteria detailing
the manner in which remedies are to be imposed that they be designed so as to minimize the time between the identification
of violations and final imposition of the remedies. Additionally, section 1919(h)(8) of the Act specifies that States
may impose a denial of payments for new admissions, temporary management, and facility closures during the pendency
of any hearing. We believe it would be incompatible with these pronouncements were we to devise an appeal scheme that
would provide for hearings before the imposition of remedies. Moreover, we conclude that this is the case regardless
of whether the facility's deficiencies pose immediate jeopardy to resident health or safety since the Act makes no
distinction on this basis and because the delay in imposing remedies once noncompliance has been identified could
be considerable.

Pre-sanction hearings are available when monetary penalties are assessed because the provisions of section 1128A

A few commenters stated that there was no statutory basis for HCFA's proposal to eliminate pre-sanction hearings

noted that there is a material difference between the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the impact of not having a pre-hearing
available because nursing homes usually have many more Medicaid residents than Medicare residents. They stated
that loss of Medicaid reimbursement has a greater financial impact than the loss of Medicare reimbursement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 are adequate to protect the health, safety, welfare, and rights of residents and to promote the effective and efficient
use of public moneys.'' (Sections 1819(f) and 1919(f) of the Act, emphasis added). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As we stated in the proposed rule, we believe that there are compelling reasons to provide for an appeals mechanism
under Medicaid that is triggered only after an adverse action has gone into effect. As discussed above, we believe
this scheme most accurately reflects legislative intent. Additionally, we believe the Act gives us general rulemaking
authority to achieve this objective and that, in particular, we have authority to regulate the timing of State Medicaid
hearings that may be provided in accordance with section 1919(h)(7) of the Act. We also see no reason why the rules governing
the Medicaid program in this area should be any different than those governing the Medicare program when the substantive
requirements affecting providers are exactly the same and the enforcement options are virtually identical. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For Medicaid, the only hearing a provider will receive is that which is provided for in this final rule, as determined
by &sect;488.330(e)(4). When States hear certification and licensure appeals under the same process, that process
can be used for Medicaid purposes as long as it does not go beyond the scope of the hearing procedures in part 431. Part
431 only provides for appeals of deficiencies that lead to an enforcement remedy; therefore, appeals of deficiencies
that did not lead to an enforcement remedy will not be recognized for Medicaid purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated above, we believe that residents are the primary beneficiaries of the Medicare and Medicaid program, and
their interests are paramount. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals stated as follows in

This anticipated damage to Mrs. Case, which is certainly serious, does not compare favorably with the government's
interest in the safety of her patients. A nursing facility's ``need'' for patients has nothing to do with the statutory
benefits structure. The facility's need is incidental. That a particular nursing facility cannot survive without
Medicaid participation was certainly not Congress' foremost consideration in its creation of the Medicaid program.
This is not to derogate Mrs. Case's property interest in her expectation of continued participation. We must, however,
place that right in proper perspective with regard to the health and safety expectations of the patients, which expectations
the Secretary has a valid interest in protecting. The benefits to a nursing home from its participation in Medicaid
reimbursement result from nothing more than a statutory business relationship.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters offered alternatives to the proposed post-sanction hearings. Some accepted HCFA's goal of applying
remedies immediately, but proposed that States should be allowed the flexibility to use pre-sanction hearings in
limited circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some wanted the option to use pre-sanction hearings in cases where deficiencies are minor and States have a high caseload
of appeals (presumably making it difficult to obtain a speedy post-remedy hearing); some wanted pre-sanction hearings
in all cases unless the facility was substantially out of compliance or the deficiency was deemed life threatening.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some stated that although the residents' interests prevail when the deficiencies impair their safety, the facility's
interests should prevail when the deficiencies are less serious, thereby justifying pre-sanction hearings. For
example, some commenters agreed that substandard care needed to be addressed expeditiously, prior to any hearing,
but other deficiencies could be addressed after an expedited appeals process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some proposed a balancing test under which the procedures would vary according to the interests at stake. The residents'
interests would specifically be balanced against the nursing home's interests on a case by case basis. A post-sanction
hearing would be held in cases of immediate jeopardy, and pre-sanction hearings would be held when the threat to residents
was less extreme. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some wanted States to have the option of providing pre-sanction hearings in all cases. Some wanted to retain the present
State option in the Medicaid program to provide either pre-termination hearings or post-termination hearings which
must be completed within 120 days of the effective date of the termination. A few commented that requiring completion
of the hearing within 120 days would alleviate HCFA's concern that pre-sanction hearings would delay imposition
of remedies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter proposed that an existing State procedure be adopted, whereby the State schedules an appeal within
30 days of receiving a request for a hearing; an impartial decision maker makes a recommendation within 30 days of the
hearing, and the Secretary makes a final decision within 10 days. Another proposed a 10 day filing period for requesting
an appeal; a hearing held within 30 days of request; and a decision within 30 days of the hearing.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few commenters proposed minimizing the time between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identification of remedies and imposition of remedies by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instituting deadlines in an expedited hearing process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These commenters proposed imposing time periods for filing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of documents by all parties, and mandatory deadlines for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decisions by hearing officers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters proposed allowing States to follow their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
own Administrative Procedure Act provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some submitted State license laws for our consideration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, under one State's license law, deficiencies are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classified based on whether there is a substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
probability of death or serious mental or physical harm 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Class A), a direct threat to health, safety or welfare of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resident (Class B), or no direct threat to health, safety or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
welfare of a resident (Class C). Class A violations require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediate abatement, subject to a Court injunction for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failure to abate; Class B or C violations require a plan of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correction within 10 days (extendable to 30). Timeframes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are included, providing generally for requesting hearings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within 10 days after notice, and providing hearings within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30 days of request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are not accepting suggestions that would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require pre-sanction hearings because we continue to believe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that residents are best served if remedies are imposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promptly. The residents are the beneficiaries of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare and Medicaid programs, and their best interests are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the motivating force behind OBRA '87 and these regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are not mandating post-remedy hearings. We are merely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not requiring a hearing to be completed before imposing any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanction but civil money penalties. Depending on the size 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the case load and processing times, a State could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete a hearing prior to the imposition of a remedy, but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be consistent with these regulations any hearing would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need to be conducted and concluded very shortly after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance was identified. However, we acknowledge that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the ability to provide a pre-sanction hearing would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difficult for most States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are not accepting the various proposals on timing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
events within the hearing process itself. With respect to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare, some of these time periods are established by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act, as is true, for example, for the 60 day period in which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to appeal. With respect to both Medicare and Medicaid, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearings are held by independent hearing officers who are in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a far better position than HCFA to determine how quickly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various hearings can be held. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We do not believe that State license law is analogous to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare and Medicaid provider agreements. As we stated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above, providers have entered into agreements with Medicare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Medicaid in which they have agreed to comply with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal requirements, including the requirements applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to remedies for noncompliance.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters proposed an explicit review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period during which the State survey agency's central office 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would give providers an opportunity to question, clarify and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
develop the issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are adopting this proposal with some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modification to require dispute resolution by an official in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the survey agency and/or HCFA regional office. See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussion under the heading, Dispute resolution. We 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe that making an informal dispute resolution process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available alleviates many of the concerns expressed above, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and gives a provider an opportunity to present its side of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the story to the survey agency and/or regional office 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officials prior to imposition of remedies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters wanted a right to appeal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all deficiencies, even if no remedy was imposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are not accepting this suggestion because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if no remedy is imposed, the provider has suffered no injury 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calling for an appeal. We agree that deficiencies that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constitute noncompliance and that result in a remedy imposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are appealable (except for minor remedies such as State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters approved our plan to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide a single hearing for dually participating SNF/NFs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter wanted two hearings, if the same deficiency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was cited by two survey agencies, unless the provider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested a single hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are adopting a single hearing, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed, in accordance with procedures in 42 CFR part 498, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because we believe that it would be extremely burdensome and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costly for the government to participate in two hearings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Witnesses would need to testify twice, in different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
locations. Attorneys would be required to prepare for two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate proceedings, and respond to two different sets of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedural rules. Further, because the two hearings would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be based on the same set of facts, a second hearing is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary. Before OBRA '87, the practice was to provide one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing for dually participating facilities, in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with procedures at 42 CFR part 498, and this proved to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfactory. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter stated that the ombudsman should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate in the hearing because sections 712(a)(3)(E), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 712(a)(5)(B)(iv) of the Older Americans Act Amendments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 1992 authorize ombudsmen to represent the interests of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the residents before governmental agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are not adopting this suggestion because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residents are not a party to the Medicare or Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreements between providers and HCFA or the State agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, the entire process of surveys, determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance or noncompliance, and citing deficiencies is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process designed to protect the interests of the residents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ombudsman can, of course, advise the survey agency of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any concerns relevant to a particular facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A few commenters suggested that States should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be necessary parties in any hearing, stating that when HCFA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decertifies facilities the results of the survey could be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used as evidence that the State survey agency was negligent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in surveying the facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This comment apparently refers to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decertification of a facility after a HCFA validation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey. We are not adopting this proposal, because in any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing the parties to the hearing are the complainant (the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provider, in this case) and the party who made the decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about which the complaint is made (HCFA in the case of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
validation survey). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A few commenters recommended that residents be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permitted to be parties in any hearings, to ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminations are used only as a last resort. A few also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wanted residents to be able to initiate challenges through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the appeal process when either HCFA or the State failed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply remedies when appropriate. A few wanted residents to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be notified of enforcement actions at the same time a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nursing home is notified.

Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are not adopting these suggestions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because we believe that the needs of the residents to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heard are addressed in other ways. As a threshold matter, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Supreme Court has already concluded in the previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cited 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
O'Bannon 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
decision that residents do not have a right 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to a pre-termination hearing when the facility in which they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reside faces a provider agreement termination. Whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residents might testify to a facility's compliance or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance, arguments on both sides of the issue are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
already being made by either the government or the provider. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certainly, a provider has every incentive to state its case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it was in compliance with certification requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and that it ought not be the subject of an adverse action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, if residents were interested in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contributing to the case against a facility, whatever 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence they might have could be shared with surveyors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before, during, or after the completion of a survey. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Residents have always had, and will continue to have, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunities to discuss facility conditions with surveyors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either individually or in group meetings, and always have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the right to comment on the care they are receiving. Except 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when there is immediate jeopardy to resident health or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety, the States and the Secretary have very broad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discretion under the Act to select among enumerated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies. Just as we believe it is not for facilities to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
choose what remedies they should be subject to, we do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe that facility residents should make that choice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters proposed that we clarify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when sanctions are to be imposed. Some feared that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanctions would be imposed by the survey team onsite as soon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a deficiency is cited. Some wanted clarification that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State survey agency would be given a reasonable period

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is not our intent that the survey team 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impose remedies. Moreover, the appropriate agency for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposing remedies does not do so prior to the time the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility receives written notice of the noncompliance and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
written notice of the remedy(ies) to be imposed. The survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency will have time to review the findings and make a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision as to compliance or noncompliance, and recommend a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedy or remedies to the appropriate State entity or to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA, depending on whose decision controls as specified at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sections 1919(h)(6) and (7) of the Act.

specified in proposed &sect;488.180(d), the notice of hearing

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 1864 of the Act, the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey agency certifies to HCFA, in a document called a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Certification and Transmittal,'' the status of a facility's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with the statutory and regulatory requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In certain situations, HCFA itself makes the decision on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether a facility complies, as is the case for State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities and in the case of validation surveys. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification of compliance or noncompliance is a decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made by one of the governmental agencies (HCFA or the State) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to notification of the provider. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a certification of noncompliance is made, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provider is notified in accordance with &sect;488.330(c). It is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
usually notified in a separate notice of remedies to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposed, in accordance with &sect;488.402(f). (There may not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two separate notices in the case of immediate jeopardy.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Except for the imposition of civil money penalties, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providers are given notice before the effective date of all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies. In the case of civil money penalties, providers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are given a pre-sanction hearing before civil money 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalties can be collected. The notice given to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provider includes a notice of the remaining noncompliance, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(even if there was a prior notice of deficiencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constituting noncompliance found on the survey) and notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of an opportunity to request a hearing, in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;431.153(d) and &sect;498.20(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a hearing is requested, the hearing must include the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
components specified in &sect;431.153(e). Note that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement in &sect;431.153(e) that the facility receive notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and a copy of the statement of deficiencies is accomplished 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to the hearing, in accordance with &sect;431.153(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We do not believe that the regulations need to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
re-written to achieve the above intended result. Providers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be given notice of any deficiencies if HCFA or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State survey agency determines, that is, certifies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance. They will also be given notice of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies that are imposed, and notice of their right to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request a hearing.

A few commenters requested that the notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
given to the provider include not only the deficiencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found and the remedies selected but also the severity/scope 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rating for each deficiency. These commenters wanted an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity to appeal the severity/scope ratings.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are not accepting this comment. As we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discuss later in this preamble, with the exception of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain civil money penalties, providers will not have the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity to appeal the scope and severity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many States commenting on this section believe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the HCFA finding of noncompliance should not supersede 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a State survey agency certification of compliance when both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are available. States assert that State surveyors are more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
familiar with the operation of specific facilities in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State and that HCFA's surveyors may impose remedies because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of their lack of familiarity with a particular facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1919(g)(3)(A) of the Act mandates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the Secretary's determination as to the facility's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance is binding and supersedes that of the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey. Moreover, HCFA surveyors do not impose remedies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rather, the managerial staff in the HCFA regional offices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decide on the most appropriate remedy to be imposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, we are not accepting this suggestion.

A few commenters said that the certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and validation surveys constitute unreasonable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative searches which violate the Fourth Amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
They stated that routine inspections require a warrant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unless the survey is initiated in accordance with neutral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria and the surveyor's discretion is limited by an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative plan defining the scope and procedure of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection, citing

justified and because the proposed rule contains no limits

Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Providers have consented to certification and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
validation surveys and to complaint investigations by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
choosing to participate as providers in the Medicare or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid programs, or both. As indicated previously, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Supreme Court has long upheld warrantless searches of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closely regulated businesses, and the nursing home industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is no exception. Moreover, section 1128(b)(12) of the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides for the exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs of an individual or an entity who denies access to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary or the State agency for the purpose of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey to determine a provider's compliance with Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Some commenters suggested that we require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coordination of complaint investigations with the State or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
local ombudsman program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Act does not require the State to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coordinate complaint investigations with ombudsman programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, under the Act, each State is required to notify the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State long-term care ombudsman of its findings of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance as specified on the HCFA&hyph;2567, with any of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements pertaining to provision of services, resident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rights, or administration and other matters. The State also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides the long term care ombudsman with any report of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse action (specified at &sect;488.406 of this rule) imposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on a facility. We are including the requirement for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disclosing such information to long term care ombudsman at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.325.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Some commenters believed that &sect;488.332 should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include procedures, including timing, evaluation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
severity, and protocols, to be used in the investigation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complaints of violations of participation requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These commenters offered a variety of specific procedures to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be included in this regulatory section. Also, commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested that the State investigate all complaints 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received, while other commenters suggested giving States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flexibility to determine whether there is a reasonable basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for an investigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As explained fully in the preamble to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule, sections 1819(g)(4)(A) and 1919(g)(4)(A) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act require each State to maintain procedures to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigate complaints of violations of Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation requirements. Additionally, the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operations Manual has prescribed procedures State agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must follow if complaints involve Medicare and/or Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities. We believe these procedures, which are subject 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to ongoing revisions, provide basic minimum instructions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with sufficient flexibility, for State agencies to follow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when investigating complaints. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We do not believe that it would be reasonable or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economically feasible to require States, especially those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with remotely located facilities, to survey all facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for which complaints are received. The experience of State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey agencies has shown that many complaints are either 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
groundless or are not potential violations of requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for certification. This position, however, does not relieve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the States from their responsibilities to properly evaluate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and investigate all complaints that may affect a facility's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure these responsibilities are properly carried 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
out, &sect;&sect;488.318 and 488.320 of these rules and sections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1819(g)(3)(C) and 1919(g)(3)(C) of the Act require that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary provide appropriate remedies when a State fails to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perform survey and certification responsibilities required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the Act. In addition, HCFA evaluates the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare/Medicaid survey and certification performance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State survey agencies with the State Agency Evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program (SAEP). The SAEP identifies, among other factors, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State actions with regard to the investigation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complaints. In Federal fiscal year 1992, the SAEP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment of the State agency's timely processing of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general certification related complaints indicated that on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
national average between 90 and 99 percent of all general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification related complaints reviewed in the sample were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processed in a timely manner. The evaluation included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining if allegations which may involve immediate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jeopardy were investigated within two working days of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receipt and also determining if non-immediate jeopardy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complaints were processed in accordance with existing State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency procedures for prioritizing and investigating general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification related complaints. The SAEP data for fiscal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year 1992 also confirmed that in the sample of complaints 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reviewed, which included general certification related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complaints, complaints against accredited hospitals and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violations of section 1867 of the Act (Examination and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Treatment for Emergency Medical Conditions and Women in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Labor), between 90 and 100 percent of complaints were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collected, logged, referred and acknowledged in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the guidelines provided in the State Operations Manual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and specific policy memoranda. Any inappropriate State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions are discussed with State survey agency management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and reconciled accordingly.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Some commenters suggested that the regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
state that complaints may be accepted from anonymous sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or provide for the anonymity of complainants if requested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We recognize there are instances when it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to protect the identity of a complainant to avoid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible reprisal. In keeping with this, States are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructed in the State Operations Manual to take 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate precautions to protect a complainant's anonymity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and privacy, if possible. While we do not believe we can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guarantee anonymity should an adverse action result from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigation, we would expect that ultimately the issue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before a trier of fact would be the substantial compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or noncompliance with certification requirements, not the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identity of the individual who brought the allegation to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey agency's attention. We are revising &sect;488.332 to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide that, if possible, the State survey agency takes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate precautions to protect a complainant's anonymity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and privacy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Many commenters asked for an explanation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the term ``monitoring'' used in this section. There seemed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be a pervasive thought that the term as used in this section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was analogous to the remedy of ``State monitoring'' found in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.406. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We believe the term ``monitoring,'' as found in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1819(g)(4) and 1919(g)(4) of the Act, is intended to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
encompass the entire survey process, which is to ascertain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether a facility is in substantial compliance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for participation in the Medicare or Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs, or both. The use of this term in this section of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the rules should not be construed as to alter the protocols 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for long term care surveys which are found in the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operations Manual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 488.332(b) gives States flexibility to visit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities at their discretion in order to determine whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or not they are in compliance with program requirements. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should not, as some commenters felt, be an option whether or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not to follow up on deficiencies cited on previous visits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Note the following comment and response regarding follow up 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
visits.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, we are changing the title of this section so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that ``monitoring'' is distinct and separate from complaint 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 Commenters asked whether or not follow up

 The proposed rules do not change our position 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding the scheduling and conduct of follow up visits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This position is described in the State Operations Manual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Correction of noncompliance must be verified by some type of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
follow up activity; albeit, not necessarily by an on-site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
visit. The timing of follow up visits must be determined by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors such as the effect of the noncompliance on the care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the facility's residents and the date of correction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified in the provider's plan of correction.

 Some commenters suggested that investigations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of complaints regarding violations of participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements be solely the responsibility of the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey agency. Other commenters maintained that necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referrals are not being made to other State agencies.

 The Act provides that a State may maintain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and utilize a specialized team for the purpose of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identifying, surveying, gathering and preserving evidence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and does not specify that such team be part of the survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency. However, if a State uses a specialized team that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not part of the survey agency, the State survey agency is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not absolved of its responsibility to properly document 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complaints and their findings and take required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification action with respect to a facility's Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or Medicare participation, or both.

In keeping with this responsibility, we are strengthening &sect;488.332 by requiring that, if arrangements have
been made with other State components for investigation of complaints, the State must have a means of communicating
information among appropriate entities, and the State survey agency retains responsibility for the investigation
process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, we are adding a paragraph to &sect;488.335 requiring that State survey agencies consider complaints of neglect,
abuse or misappropriation of resident property by an individual used by a facility to provide services to residents
as a potential reflection on a facility's compliance with Medicaid and/or Medicare participation requirements.

The Act, at sections 1819(g)(4) and 1919(g)(4), refers to an ``attorney'' as well as other professions (auditor,
appropriate health care professionals) to describe examples of various disciplines that may be used to make up specialized
teams to investigate violations of requirements by nursing facilities or skilled nursing facilities and, in a broader
sense, to monitor all facilities for compliance with the requirements of sections 1819(b), (c), and (d) and 1919(b),
(c), and (d) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We did not intend that attorneys be a routine part of such teams; however, the language of the Act and proposed rules
gives States a broad choice of occupations from which to choose for the survey and certification process.

in those instances when an attorney is part of the specialized complaint investigation team.

Notifying a facility in advance of a complaint survey so that its attorney might be present is, in fact, announcing
the survey. To do so is inconsistent with HCFA policy, which intends that as many surveys as possible be unannounced.

We appreciate the concern of these commenters who recognize that the investigation and resolution of complaints
is a critical certification activity requiring properly trained investigators, and we will consider these concerns
as we strive to continually improve our training courses. However, we believe that the expertise of a special investigation
team and the overall State survey agency responsibility for complaint investigations provides a coordinated effort
that assures that the complaint investigation process is executed by properly trained individuals. Sections 1819(g)(4)
and 1919(g)(4) of the Act provide that the State may maintain and utilize a specialized team which may include an auditor,
an attorney, and appropriate health care professionals to identify, survey, gather and preserve evidence, and carry
out appropriate enforcement action against substandard facilities. The discipline, specific training, and education
of such a specialized team provides the narrow focus that is often essential to conduct a comprehensive complaint
investigation. The State survey agency has the overall survey and certification responsibility and expertise that
assures that surveyors can ascertain when Medicare and Medicaid facilities meet participation requirements.

While we cannot deny that there may be instances in which a complainant is dissatisfied with the findings of a complaint
investigation, we cannot accept the recommendation to include an appeal process for the complainant in the regulation
as the complainant is not a party to the provider agreement.

Although we may have discretion with the selection of remedies to address noncompliance with requirements that are
corrected by the time of a survey, it is likely that we would give serious consideration to imposing a civil money penalty
in such cases. Sections 1819(h)(1) and 1919(h) (1) and (3) of the Act expressly authorize the impositions of these
sanctions even if, at the time of the survey, the facility is in compliance.

A few commenters recommended that the provision which includes administering remedies to noncompliant facilities

against chronically substandard facilities.

We do not agree. While the facility's compliance history is a factor in general and specifically with reference to
the cited deficiencies in determining the appropriate remedy or remedies, we will not limit the remedies to only those
facilities which have chronically provided substandard care. To do so, would be to allow many deficiencies that constitute
noncompliance to go unsanctioned. This undermines the purpose of remedies that are intended to motivate prompt compliance
with participation requirements.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The consensus of those who commented on &sect;488.334, with the exception of the following two commenters, was that
there is a definite need for educational programs for facilities, residents, and their representatives. The two
commenters stated that it was unrealistic to expect the States to conduct periodic educational programs for the staff
and residents of facilities either because of the cost, because they felt the requirement was already met when surveyors
interviewed residents, or because the appearance of objectivity would be jeopardized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulatory provision requiring the States to conduct periodic educational programs stems from a statutory requirement
at sections 1819(g)(1) and 1919(g)(1) of the Act. The concept that the requirement is met when surveyors interview
residents is not acceptable for two reasons: First, surveyors do not interview every resident. Secondly, the responsibility
of a surveyor is to survey nursing homes and not to have attention deflected to educate staff and residents as to regulations,
procedures, and policies. In fact, even if surveyors were to attempt an educational task, time and money constraints
would prevent them from being able to provide complete information to staff and residents. As to the appearance of
objectivity being jeopardized, this is not an issue since the Act requires that States assume this responsibility.
However, irrespective of the Act, there is no reason why a State's educational program, explaining the Federal requirements,
should jeopardize the State's objectivity in exercising its survey function. We believe that well-informed staff
and residents contribute to nursing homes' being able to achieve and maintain compliance. If the implementation
of training programs is followed by a pattern of increased facility compliance, one can just as easily conclude that
providers and their clients are becoming more knowledgeable about the requirements to which they are subject, than
that surveyors are losing their objectivity.

Several commenters recommended that State educational programs for consumers be expanded. Several commenters
suggested that we require State survey agencies to involve ombudsmen in the development of educational programs
and in the planning and implementation of additional training of residents. Another commenter suggested that we
require State agencies to give NFs access to training programs for State surveyors. Several commenters suggested
that we conduct joint continuing education programs for providers and surveyors. A few commenters recommended that
we make HCFA's inservice training programs available to facilities. Another commenter recommended adding to this
regulation that the State make available to staff and residents documents related to current regulations, procedures,
and policies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 1819(g)(1)(B) and 1919(g)(1)(B) of the Act require that States conduct educational programs for facility
staff and residents (and their representatives) regarding current regulations, procedures and policies of the
long-term care survey process. We include ombudsmen as representatives of residents. Such information will be provided
during educational programs as they relate to the content of the program. Such regulations, policies, and procedures
are also releasable under the Freedom of Information Act, and can be requested outside of the scope of the educational
program. There is no statutory requirement to include ombudsmen in the development, planning, and implementation
of educational programs and we feel that each State should develop its own program regarding these activities. A State
may or may not choose to include ombudsmen in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
development
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of its program. In any case, we are interpreting the Act to include ombudsmen in educational programs as representatives
of residents. The suggestion has been made that providers be permitted to attend survey training courses. Traditionally,
we have had no provisions for accommodating all providers interested in attending; our resources are taxed enough
by simply trying to provide timely training for surveyors. However, being able to offer surveyor training universally
to providers at their own cost may help improve understanding and cooperation between surveyors and providers. We
are therefore seriously considering changing our policy to allow this.

Two commenters representing consumer groups, suggested that &sect;&sect;488.303 and 488.334 be expanded to require
State agencies to provide education to residents and their representatives in a variety of additional areas such
as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 These suggestions have considerable merit and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are within both the spirit and intent of the Act. We agree 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the commenters that the proposed regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unnecessarily restricted the scope of the mandated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
educational programs. The regulation is being revised to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit the education programs to cover all aspects of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
long-term care survey process. We believe the States should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have the flexibility to structure the educational programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the needs of the facilities. The methods of developing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the programs (for example, consultation with the ombudsmen 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program) and the methods of presentation are best left to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the States. The comment that States should work with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residents and family councils to solicit their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendations prior to any changes in requirements goes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beyond the educational process. In some respects, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment incorporates residents and families as participants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the survey and enforcement processes. Whenever there is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public rulemaking, any member of the public is a participant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the process and can comment and make recommendations on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such matters. In addition, when surveyors speak with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residents during the survey, residents are free to bring up 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments about the survey process if they wish. Regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the comment that residents' understanding of the survey, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigation, and the care planning processes should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expanded, we repeat that the regulation is being amended to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit the educational programs to cover all aspects of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
long-term care process.

 It is beyond the scope of this regulation to

institute such detailed procedures as providing satellite 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training to consumers or specifying any other training

medium. It is beyond our technological capabilities to

provide training via satellite to every SNF and NF in the

 One commenter stated that, although this

section providing education to residents and staff of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities is an excellent idea, it lacks specificity and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oversight. Because of budgetary crises, this is but another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
educational program at State expense and will receive low 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
priority. HCFA must ensure that the State will conduct

educational programs at particular time intervals or face

 Although there is no statutory provision

requiring HCFA to oversee States to determine if they have

failed to conduct educational programs as required by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act, we recognize that we have some responsibility to do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is within the purview of the States to decide how and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when to conduct their educational programs. We believe it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is wiser to leave these decisions to the individual States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
since they must design the educational programs the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifies. However, we are looking into the feasibility of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring the States in some way to assure that they are in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with this statutory requirement. We plan to find 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an acceptable approach to evaluating State efforts in

 A commenter stated that further definition of

the nature and frequency of educational programs is needed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and, for consistency, HCFA should establish the nature and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
content of such programs. There could be extensive new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resource requirements if the program is not considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate. Another commenter recommends that we define 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``periodic'' and detail the process for State compliance.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As previously mentioned, the nature and

content could cover any of the requirements of sections 1819 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 1919 of the Act. When manual instructions are

the word ``conduct.'' The Act gives the responsibility for

developing educational programs specifically to the States.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Some commenters suggested regulatory language 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requiring coordination of investigations of complaints of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neglect, abuse, or misappropriation of property with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State or local ombudsman program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Act does not require the State to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coordinate complaint investigations with the State long term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
care ombudsman. However, under the Act, each State is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to notify the State long term care ombudsman of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
findings of noncompliance with any of the requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pertaining to provision of services, resident rights, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administration and other matters. The State also provides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State long term care ombudsman with any report of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse action (specified at &sect;488.406 of this rule) imposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on a facility. We have included the requirement for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disclosing such information to the long term care ombudsman 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at &sect;488.325. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Some commenters felt procedures for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigating complaints of neglect, abuse, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misappropriation of property should be included in the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As stated in the proposed rule, we believe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such an approach is inconsistent with our view that States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should have the flexibility to rely on State entities other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than the State survey agency to investigate and adjudicate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these matters. States will likely use an array of different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensing or investigative bodies to meet their obligations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in this area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters suggested that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigations of allegations of neglect, abuse, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misappropriation of property be integrated into the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comprehensive survey, certification and enforcement process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, there were suggestions that investigations of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complaints be conducted solely by the State survey agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Act requires that States must provide, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through the agency responsible for surveys and certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of nursing facilities, for a process for the receipt and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
timely review and investigation of allegations of resident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neglect or abuse, or misappropriation of resident property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As pointed out in the preamble to the proposed rule, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
while the State is free to delegate to other State agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the adjudicatory functions described in sections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1819(g)(1)(C) and 1919(g)(1)(C) of the Act, we fully expect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State survey agencies to retain ultimate responsibility for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with these statutory requirements. If a State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uses an agency which is not part of the State survey agency, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State survey agency cannot be absolved of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility to properly document complaints and take 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required certification action with respect to a facility's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation in either the Medicaid or Medicare programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In keeping with this responsibility, we are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strengthening the rules under &sect;488.335(a) by cross 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referencing &sect;488.332, which specifies that the State survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency retains responsibility for the investigation process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and requiring the State survey agency to have a means of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
communicating information among appropriate entities if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other State agencies are involved in the investigation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these complaints.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the above comments we are adding a new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement that State survey agencies consider all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complaints of resident neglect or abuse, or misappropriation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of resident property as a potential reflection on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility's compliance with Medicaid and/or Medicare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation requirements. This new requirement is at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.335(h). (The provisions in &sect;488.185 (g) and (h) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed rule are revised and combined in &sect;488.335(g) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and are discussed later in this preamble.)

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Some commenters suggested that the words, ``by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an individual used by the facility'' be added to paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) of this section as it requires the State to review all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allegations of neglect, abuse, or misappropriation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resident property. Commenters pointed out that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested text is found in the Act and the preamble to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are revising and expanding &sect;488.335(a), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and in doing so, incorporating the comment. This paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
now specifies that the State reviews all allegations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resident abuse and neglect and misappropriation of resident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
property. The State also follows the procedures of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.332. We are adding that, if there is reason to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe, either through oral or written evidence, that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual used by the facility to provide services to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residents could have abused or neglected a resident or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misappropriated a resident's property, the State must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigate the allegation. We also now specify in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section that the State must have written procedures for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
timely review and investigation of these allegations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters mentioned that the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rules do not specify a timeframe for initiation of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigation nor a time limit on the length of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigation of neglect, abuse, or misappropriation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resident property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Our intent in writing this rule was to not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
too prescriptive of State investigation processes. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manual instructions to State survey agencies specify a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
timeframe for situations of immediate jeopardy in which they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should initiate complaint investigations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We chose not to regulate the time in which a State must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete its investigation of these types of complaints. We 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thought a specific time limit could, in some instances, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compromise the outcome of the investigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Some commenters suggested that the rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specify a timeframe in which the State must notify an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual when there is reason to believe that the abuse, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neglect, or misappropriation of resident property did occur. Also, some suggested that we notify the administrator
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owner of the facility employing such person, or both. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, some commenters suggested that we include in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice to the accused person the consequences of the hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination or waiving the right to a hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We do not accept the comment to send a notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the individual implicated in an allegation of resident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neglect or abuse or misappropriation of resident property 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before the State has conducted an investigation. To do so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could possibly jeopardize the outcome of the investigation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and in some cases would be premature as the investigation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
might find the allegation unsupported. However, we are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revising the final rule at &sect;488.335(c) to require that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State must notify the individual implicated in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allegation and the current administrator of the facility in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the incident occurred, in writing within 10 working 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
days of its preliminary determination, which is based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oral or written evidence and its investigation, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resident neglect or abuse, or misappropriation of resident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
property occurred. This timeframe was selected to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
timely notice to the individual involved and yet, give 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States sufficient time to provide such notice. We are also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revising the final rule to reflect that this notice to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual includes the consequences of a hearing finding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and of waiving the right to a hearing. We are adding that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the notice includes a statement to inform the accused 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual of the right to be represented by an attorney at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the individual's own expense. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We received several comments suggesting that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we establish, by regulation, a more extensive ``due process'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appeal mechanism for facility employees accused of neglect, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
abuse, or misappropriation of a resident's property.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We recognize the importance of the need for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fair and impartial hearing whenever an individual used by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the facility is accused of resident neglect or abuse, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misappropriation of a resident's property. However, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognize that all States have administrative procedure acts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which allow for resolution of disputed cases of this nature. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, we chose to allow the need for these appeals to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addressed by State law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Some commenters felt the provision to allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
120 days for States to conduct hearings of staff accused of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neglect, abuse, or misappropriation of a resident's property 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was excessive and suggested other dates, while other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters felt the 120 day period did not allow sufficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time for a State's administrative process to complete the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 While we agree that a person accused of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resident neglect, abuse, or misappropriation of a resident's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
property is entitled to swift determination of the accusation, we believe States must be given reasonable time in

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which to schedule and conduct the hearing process under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their administrative procedure acts. Our experience with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other related State hearings indicates that 120 days is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable timeframe for scheduling and completing these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appeals.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters suggested we modify the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rules so they specify who should be notified when a person 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accused of neglect, abuse, or misappropriation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resident's property waives the right to a hearing or when a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State hearing finds that such an individual did, in fact, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
act as accused. In addition, some commenters suggested we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specify timeframes for such reporting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In response to these comments, we are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rewriting &sect;488.335(f) and combining paragraphs (g) and (h) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into (g) to clarify the reporting process and to include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
timeframes for reporting. We are specifying that the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey agency, which may not delegate this responsibility, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must report in writing the finding that an individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neglected or abused a resident or misappropriated a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resident's property within 10 working days of the finding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to: the individual; the current administrator of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility in which the incident occurred; the administrator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the facility currently employing the individual, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different; the licensing authority for individuals other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than nurse aides; and the nurse aide registry. For nurse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aides, these findings must not only be reported to the nurse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aide registry but must be included in the nurse aide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registry within 10 working days of the finding in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with &sect;483.156(c)(iv)(D).

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We received comments suggesting that if an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allegation was found to be untrue, that accusation be

expunged from the nurse aide registry.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An allegation of resident abuse or neglect or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misappropriation of resident property that is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantiated would not be entered on the nurse aide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registry. Only a finding of resident abuse or neglect or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misappropriation of resident property would be entered on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the nurse aide registry. Section 483.156(c)(1)(iv) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifies the particular information that the registry must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contain with regard to any finding by the State survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency of abuse, neglect or misappropriation of property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This information includes documentation of the State's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigation (including the nature of the allegation and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the evidence that led the State to conclude that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allegation was valid), the date of the hearing and its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outcome (if a hearing was requested), and a statement by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual disputing the allegation (if the individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chooses to make one). The rule also provides that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information must be included in the registry within 10 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
working days of the finding and must remain in the registry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permanently unless the finding was made in error, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual was found not guilty in a court of law, or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State is notified of the individual's death.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We received several comments regarding the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nurse aide registry. Commenters offered suggestions for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contents of the registry, its availability to the public and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action taken as a result of substantiation of abuse, neglect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or misappropriation of property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that the report of findings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision include notifying the appropriate law enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorities in those cases where a crime has been committed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Several commenters suggested that every 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigation seek to identify facility practices which led 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the neglect, abuse or misappropriation of resident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
property.

Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We believe that every investigation does seek 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to identify facility practices which led to the resident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neglect or abuse, or misappropriation of resident property 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and this is evidenced by the guidance currently provided to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the States in manual instructions. These guidelines include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the general procedures for conducting complaint 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigations and stipulate that, if significant problems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are identified during an initial assessment or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
observations, the scope of the review is expanded as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary. The procedures also specify that when the team 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is investigating allegations of substandard care, they are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to evaluate not only the care of the individuals involved in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the allegation, but also to evaluate the facility's patterns 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of related care. Also, noncompliance identified during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey is recorded on the Statement of Deficiencies and Plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Correction (HCFA&hyph;2567) and a plan of correction is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested. When the facility is not in substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance as a result of the deficiencies identified, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcement actions could include the imposition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative remedies or termination of a facility's provider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few commenters suggested that in those cases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where neglect was found and determined to be caused by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors beyond the control of the individual, the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency must impose sanctions upon the facility or document 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
why such sanctions are inappropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We do not accept this suggestion to add a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory requirement that obligates HCFA or the State to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impose sanctions where resident neglect was found and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined to be caused by factors beyond the control of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual. Regardless of the cause of the noncompliance, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility is not relieved of its responsibility to correct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its deficiencies. This responsibility assures that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residents consistently receive quality health care in a safe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment and it exists whether or not a remedy is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposed. However, there are instances in which a remedy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be imposed due to the egregious nature of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiency and to encourage prompt compliance. Conversely, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there are situations in which a remedy might not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary because the facility corrected the practice which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
led to the abuse. For example, firing an employee who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neglects a resident or residents could immediately correct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that deficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We do not accept the suggestion to incorporate into the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation a provision that would require documentation for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those cases in which a remedy is not imposed. We are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by the Act to document why sanctions are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposed and to require this through regulations would impose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a significant workload burden because, as stated above, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there are many cases in which deficiencies are corrected and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies are not imposed.

Redesignation of Subpart F 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted earlier, a new Subpart D of part 488, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consisting of &sect;&sect;488.201&hyph;488.211, became effective on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
August 31, 1992, shortly after this proposed rule was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published on August 28. Consequently, we must designate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart F, which was to consist of &sect;&sect;488.200&hyph;488.240, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with subsequent numbers. To assist the reader, we are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
publishing the new table of contents for Subpart F, with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designations of the proposed rule shown in parenthesis. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the following discussions, we refer to the sections as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
renumbered, with the proposal's identification included only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if distinction is necessary.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It was brought to our attention that the term ``immediate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
family'' also appears in subpart E as well as subpart F. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in the final regulation we are moving the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of ``immediate family'' to subpart E, &sect;488.301, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but we are stating the comments and responses below.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few commenters believe that the definition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of ``immediate family'' should be expanded to include niece, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nephew, and domestic partner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

We have not accepted this suggestion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1004, part 1, of the Provider Reimbursement Manual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defines ``immediate family'' for Medicare purposes. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters offered no compelling argument as to why any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual should be added to the definition of immediate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
family. In fact, we are amending our definition to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the definition found in the Provider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reimbursement Manual by deleting ``spouse of grandparent or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grandchild.''

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters pointed out that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of ``immediate jeopardy'' should be located in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart E instead of subpart F because the term is first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
introduced in subpart E.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree with the commenters. In the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule, we have relocated the definition of ``immediate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jeopardy'' from proposed &sect;488.201 in subpart F to &sect;488.301 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in subpart E. However, since commenters concerned with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responses regarding the definition of immediate jeopardy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will first look in this section, we have retained the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We received numerous comments about HCFA's or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State survey agency's ability to assign resident rights 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and/or physical environment violations at higher severity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels. These commenters believe that any deficiency could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be egregious enough to be considered ``moderate harm'' or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``immediate jeopardy.''

1919(h)(1)(A), 1919(h)(3)(B)(i), and 1919(h)(5) of the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically state that termination of participation for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility is possible with any determination of noncompliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where the State or the Secretary finds this noncompliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediately jeopardizes the health or safety of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residents. For example, immediate jeopardy to resident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health or safety may exist, but is not limited to, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presence of one of more of the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Insect or rodent infestation indicative of food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contamination or the possible spread of contagion; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Failure to control infections as evidenced by the

presence of facility-acquired infections; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Patient abuse or poor resident care, including; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+ Instances of malnutrition or dehydration that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unrelated to the resident's condition and are a result of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
patient care; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+ Neglect by the staff with the result that residents are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
often left lying in urine, feces and other waste; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Drug or pharmaceutical hazards that directly affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resident health and safety, such as: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+ Excessive drug errors or mishandling of drugs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+ Failure to provide medications as prescribed; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+ Failure to monitor drugs as evidenced by lack of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ordered laboratory work, failure to take vital signs as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicated by drug regimen, and lack of other nursing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring practices; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+ Gross mishandling of drugs such as leaving drug trays 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unattended and available to residents and visitors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+ Administration of drugs by unqualified staff; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+ Administration of experimental drugs without the

informed consent of the resident (or responsible party). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This list is not to be interpreted as all-inclusive, but

We agree that these definitions are in

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply to nursing facilities and is being revised to reflect

Some commenters suggested striking references 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the scope and severity scale and inserting the phrase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``creates imminent danger.'' Other commenters recommended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that immediate jeopardy should represent the most severe or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
life threatening violation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree with the commenters and we have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removed references to the scope and severity scale from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of immediate jeopardy. We are redefining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediate jeopardy to encompass all situations that pose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actual or potential life threatening harm, death, serious 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injury or impairment. Therefore, a life threatening 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situation or imminent danger will inevitably be considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediate jeopardy.

Many commenters were concerned that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of immediate jeopardy pertains to only physical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harm and not emotional harm.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree with the commenters that significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emotional as well as physical harm may be considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediate jeopardy. Every determination of the seriousness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a deficiency includes the consideration of whether a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resident has failed to achieve his or her highest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practicable physical, mental, or psychosocial function.

Many commenters expressed the need for us to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clarify the definition of ``new admission'' to indicate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether or not residents transferred to the hospital, with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the intention of returning, are considered new admissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
They are concerned that if denial of payment for new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
admissions is imposed, those transferred residents will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be covered if they return to the facility.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
New admission is described within &sect;442.2 as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
well as &sect;488.401. We believe these descriptions are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient and further clarification is not necessary.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters suggested that the definition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of ``plan of correction'' be amended to require the facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to identify the systemic underlying problem, make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restitution to the affected resident or residents, contain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurable outcomes for all quality of care deficiencies, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and require the facility to take further measures to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
future compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of a plan of correction is to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identify and address the underlying problem or problems for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the facility. Individual residents have other legal means 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at their disposal to seek restitution. It is impracticable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to develop model thresholds for each and every plan of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correction as each situation is different and is evaluated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordingly. Plans of correction are geared toward 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prospective compliance to ensure the underlying causes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cited deficiencies do not recur. As it is virtually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impossible to afford retroactive restitution to residents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who have been injured or have been deprived of their rights, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we have not accepted these suggestions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters wanted to have a definition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``highest practicable well-being.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The phrase ``highest practicable well-being'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was established in sections 1819(b)(2) and 1919(b)(2) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act. We believe the conspicuous absence of a definition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrates that the Congress recognized the impossibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of establishing a single definition of this phrase, as every 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resident, and his or her particular needs and abilities, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be evaluated individually.

Some commenters wanted a definition of ``repeat

deficiency.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act, in section 1819(h)(2)(B) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1919(h)(3)(C), specifies that incrementally more severe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fines must be imposed for repeated or uncorrected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies. Repeated deficiencies are described in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.438 as deficiencies in the same regulatory grouping of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements found at the last survey, subsequently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrected, and found again at the next survey.

A few commenters wanted a definition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``distinct part.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
``Distinct part'' is defined in sections 2110 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 2762 of the State Operations Manual. As it is beyond 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the scope of this regulation, we do not believe it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to place this definition in these regulations.

Some commenters wanted various other terms

defined or clarified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We define terms in regulations only if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of those terms, within the regulation, has a different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application than that which is accepted in common English 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
usage.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We received a number of comments from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health care industry, from consumer organizations, and from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professional groups regarding the purpose of the regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as set forth in proposed &sect;488.202. The consensus of those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who commented on paragraph (a) was that protecting residents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from ``actual or potential harmful outcomes resulting from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies'' is but one of many purposes of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. Other purposes commenters suggested we include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were to_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Deter noncompliance; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Punish noncompliance through the use of appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanctions; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Ensure correction of deficiencies for residents whose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
care is deficient; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Encourage sustained compliance; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Protect patient rights. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Two commenters suggested we change paragraph (a) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed &sect;488.202 to read, ``The purpose of remedies is to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
encourage prompt, rapid compliance with program requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the minimum level that will achieve correction so as to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protect residents from actual or potential outcomes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resulting from deficiencies.'' They said that, ``The Congress 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made it clear that a purpose of enforcement remedies is to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
render the time period between identification of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
correction
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (emphasis in original) as short 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as possible. This intent precludes punitive measures and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promotes the least disruption to facility operation. Based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on Congressional intent, general consensus now exists that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the enforcement process should be corrective, not punitive, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and that enforcement remedies should be set at the minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level required to achieve the desired correction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Successively stricter measures would be used as needed for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failure to correct.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Finally, one commenter said that ``prompt, rapid,'' is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
redundant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A number of these comments suggest to us that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there is some confusion between the purpose of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies and the expected outcomes of the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in order to be absolutely unequivocal, we are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revising &sect;488.402(a) to read, ``The purpose of remedies is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to ensure prompt compliance with program requirements.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two commenters suggested that the last 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sentence of proposed &sect;488.202(b)(1) be revised to read, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Survey findings are reported to the State and HCFA which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will make recommendations for corrective action.'' Their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rationale was that the determination of remedies to fit a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular deficiency or deficiencies should be made by an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
objective party in the survey agency or HCFA who did not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey the facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Another said that the same sentence should be revised to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
state, ``Survey findings are reported to the State or HCFA, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as appropriate, with recommendations for corrective action.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Still another said that we should clarify the fact that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey findings are reported with recommendations for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies, and one commenter said that our proposed paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(1) appears to exclude the possibility of imposing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies based on HCFA's paper review of State survey agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
findings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Two commenters suggested a new paragraph (b)(1) to read 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantially as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (b) Requirement for State enforcement plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (1) The State and HCFA shall develop a plan for imposing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intermediate remedies. The plan shall_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Vary remedies with the scope and severity so that more substantial remedies are imposed for more serious 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (ii) Assure that the State and HCFA minimize the time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between identification of violations and final imposition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (iii) Assure that remedies serve goals of requiring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediate correction of deficiencies, protecting residents, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correcting deficiencies for specific residents who are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harmed, punishing violations and deterring violations; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (iv) Include rules and policies about when and how 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various sanctions are imposed and when remedies are imposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
singly or in combination; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (v) Develop procedures to solicit the active 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation of residents in the enforcement process, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including permitting residents to participate in any formal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proceedings the State offers to providers to contest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposition of an intermediate remedy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The two commenters who made this suggestion also said 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that enforcement under the reform law is not a collection of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
free-standing remedies that States and the Secretary apply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on an ad hoc basis; enforcement under the law requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcement agencies to have a systematic way of making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decisions to apply sanctions. They cite the Institute of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicine (IoM) report, issued in March 1986, that says that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidelines on when to initiate sanctions are necessary for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective State enforcement. The commenters also cite the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 9, 1992 final settlement of

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Set forth guidelines for appropriately assessing

monetary penalties and other intermediate remedies (in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lieu of or in addition to termination) allowed under

process in the comprehensive enforcement system; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 E. Encourage and promote use of intermediate sanctions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as appropriate, rather than termination, to achieve the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes of the comprehensive enforcement system; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 F. Identify mechanisms to better inform the public as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to actions taken by the State against facilities that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are not in compliance with Federal Requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participation; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 G. Identify the factors to be considered in determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which remedies may or must be imposed, assuring that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more substantial remedies are imposed for more serious 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Finally, two of these commenters suggested that HCFA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specify that one of the bases for the imposition of remedies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be interfering with the work of a survey team, monitor, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and/or temporary manager. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We agree that it would be more accurate to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
say that survey findings are reported with recommendations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for remedies, and we are making that change in this final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule. We do not, however, believe that either the IoM study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or OBRA '87 calls for an inflexible cookbook approach to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcement. As noted in the comment, the IoM study speaks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of establishing ``guidelines,'' and we believe that this term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
connotes that there be a range of options available to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary and the States (including the option not to impose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any remedies). In sections 4203 and 4213 of OBRA '87, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intent to provide a flexible range of options is clearer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
still. Those sections amended sections 1819(h) and 1919(h) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Act at several places to reflect this intent. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, the Act now provides: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;``*
<!-- PJG 0060 hspace -->
&blank;9*
<!-- PJG 0060 hspace -->
&blank;9* the Secretary may impose any of the remedies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in subparagraph (B).'' (1819(h)(2)(A)(ii)); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;``Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0060 hspace -->
&blank;9*
<!-- PJG 0060 hspace -->
&blank;9*'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1819(h)(2)(A)); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;``The Secretary may take the following actions***'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1819(h)(2)(B)); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;``The Secretary may impose a civil money penalty in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount not to exceed $10,000 *
<!-- PJG 0060 hspace -->
&blank;9*
<!-- PJG 0060 hspace -->
&blank;9*.'' (1819(h)(2)(B)(ii)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Further evidence of the need to retain flexibility in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
choice of remedies is found in the House of Representatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Committee on the Budget report (H.R. Rep. No. 391, 100th 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cong., 1st Sess. 472 (1987)) that accompanied OBRA '87. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
states that, ``the Committee amendment would specify a broad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
range of sanctions for use by both the Secretary and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States.'' The committee report goes on to say that, ``The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Committee emphasizes that the remedies specified under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendment are not exclusive, and should not be construed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit the use of other remedies that may be available to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either the States or the Secretary under State or Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
law.'' It is clear that flexibility was the statutory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intent. Therefore, in order to ensure this intended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flexibility, we have set forth minimum remedies for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies according to their seriousness and offered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
several additional optional ones. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 We agree, for the most part, with the thrust of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final settlement in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Valdivia,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and are making revisions to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the relationship between deficiencies and remedies which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflect aspects of the final settlement of that case. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, these revised policies are not appropriate for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (b), which is intended only to succinctly set 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forth the basis for the imposition of remedies, and not the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outline for the entire enforcement process. Rather, we have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified the linkage between deficiencies and remedies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposed at &sect;488.408, Selection of remedies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 We do not believe that proposed &sect;488.202(b)(1) excludes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the possibility of imposing remedies based on ``HCFA's paper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review of survey agency findings.'' Since HCFA's ``paper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review'' is itself based on survey findings, it is clear that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies may be imposed as a result. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Finally, in response to the commenters who suggested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that HCFA specify that one of the bases for the imposition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of remedies be interfering with the work of a survey team, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitor, and/or temporary manager, there is authority at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1128(b)(12) of the Act to exclude a facility based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on its failure to grant access to the Secretary or to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State survey agency, and we believe this includes not only a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey team, but a monitor. Our regulations at &sect;488.415 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
set forth what happens if a facility does not relinquish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control to a temporary manager. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Based on the above discussion, we are revising 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.402(b)(1) to state that in every instance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance, one or more remedies are imposed based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies found during surveys conducted by HCFA or by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the survey agency. We are deleting paragraph (b)(2) because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we believe that manual issuances are the most appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
places for procedural information of this sort.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters suggested that we set forth at &sect;488.402(b)(2) the principle that termination of provider agreements
is a measure taken only as a last resort when the imposition of intermediate remedies has failed to correct the deficiencies.
One commenter recommends that paragraph (b)(2) be amended to state that the survey agencies should be allowed to impose
one or more remedies for each deficiency or cluster of deficiencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, one commenter said that OBRA '87 stated that when deficiencies constitute an immediate and serious threat
to residents' health and safety, neither HCFA nor the States have any discretion with regard to remedies. Rather,
the commenter said that, in such cases, HCFA or the States must impose either temporary management or a provider agreement
termination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree that termination of provider agreements is a serious measure, but not that it is a ``last resort'' in the strictest
sense. While we believe that the Congress wrote into the law the wide array of alternative remedies to encourage their
use, the Act does not require that in every case the States or the Secretary may not choose provider agreement termination
until alternative remedies have been used. We believe that the Act's alternative remedies offer States and the Secretary
a valuable opportunity to redress a wide variety of facility shortcomings through means that will promote quick correction
without having to exclude the facility from program participation, and it is our expectation not only that serious
consideration will be given for such opportunities when there is facility non-compliance, but that they will be used
far more frequently than they have in the past. It would be an entirely erroneous impression of the Act, however, to
conclude that it deprives States and the Secretary from exercising discretion to choose 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
any 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
remedy, including termination, whenever they determine it appropriate to do so. The comment suggesting that the
proposed paragraph (b)(2) be amended to state that the survey agencies should be allowed to impose one or more remedies
for each deficiency or cluster of deficiencies is inappropriate; the number of remedies that may be imposed is covered
in the proposed &sect;488.202(c). We will discuss this comment in connection with others on that paragraph.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is true that, when no immediate jeopardy exists, the Congress stated that the State or the Secretary may impose termination
or may impose one or more intermediate sanctions against the provider, or may impose both, and that this is in contrast
to the specific measures that must be imposed when immediate jeopardy exists. However, it does not follow that the
State, rather than the Federal government, should have the ability and the obligation to specify when and how each
remedy is to be applied. The Committee report that accompanied OBRA '87 clearly states:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
*&blank;*&blank;* it is the responsibility of the Secretary to take the enforcement measures necessary to assure
compliance by Medicaid facilities with the requirements of participation as well as to assure that State enforcement
activities are adequate to protect the health and safety of residents. To enable the Secretary to discharge this responsibility,
the committee amendment would greatly expand the remedies available to the Secretary under current law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
*&blank;*&blank;* [I]f both the State and the Secretary decide that remedies other than termination are appropriate,
the Secretary's selection of alternative remedies, and not those of the State apply. (H.R. Rep. No. 391, 100th Cong.,
1st Sess. 475&hyph;7 (1987)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Moreover, section 1919(h)(2)(B) of the Act specifies that the Secretary shall provide, through regulations, guidance
to States in establishing remedies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, when there is disagreement between HCFA and the State regarding enforcement action, the disagreement is
resolved in accordance with the policy set forth in &sect;488.452(d). For example, paragraph (d) says that when HCFA
or the State, but not both, establishes one or more remedies, in addition to or as an alternative to termination, the
additional or alternative remedies will also apply when_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Both HCFA and the State find that a NF has not met all the participation requirements; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Both HCFA and the State find that no immediate jeopardy exists.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this way, the sanction(s) proposed by the State can take effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above discussion and the need to make conforming changes with other provisions of the regulation, we are
revising &sect;488.402(b)(2) to indicate that the State or HCFA may apply one or more of the remedies specified in
&sect;488.406 instead of terminating the provider agreement, or in addition to termination procedures, to continue
until the effective date of the termination or until substantial compliance is achieved, and, in some cases, until
the State or HCFA is assured that substantial compliance can be maintained.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated above, one State said that &sect;488.402(b)(2) should be amended to state that the survey agencies should
be allowed to impose one or more remedies for each deficiency or cluster of deficiencies. The State's rationale is
that the proposed paragraph (c) would restrict both HCFA and the States in their efforts to encourage prompt corrective
action, and to protect residents' health and safety. Another commenter said the application of a separate remedy
for each deficiency seems unduly harsh. A remedy or set of remedies should be imposed relating to the entire universe
on deficiencies cited. Still another said that one incident should trigger the citing of no more than one remedy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters said that there is no statutory basis for paragraph (c). Other commenters asked for clarification,
suggesting that we use examples, limits, and further guidelines to ensure consistency. Of particular concern to
many was the fear that, absent these guidelines and limits, providers might incur multiple sanctions for single deficiencies
or for multiple deficiencies arising from a single act or incident. Some suggested that HCFA and the State be directed
to consider whether a facility's deficiencies are ``clustered'' or ``bundled'' (we used the term ``interrelated''
in the proposed rule) or scattered throughout the facility in deciding which remedy(ies) to impose in particular
situations.

A number of commenters wanted us to specifically set forth in regulations exactly which sanctions should be imposed
for each type of possible deficiency or group of deficiencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One State expressed concern about the potentially large number of separate follow-up visits required to verify corrections
of the deficiencies under each remedy. ``For example,'' it said_

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
If separate civil monetary penalties are imposed for several deficiencies, or groups of deficiencies, it would be
expected that deficiencies would be corrected on different dates and that the facility would insist on immediate
followup on each deficiency or group of deficiencies in order to immediately end the daily monetary penalty. Additionally,
a follow-up would be required at 90 days after the survey to determine if denial of payments would be required under
[the proposed] 488.212(a)(3), and another followup would be required at six months to determine if termination is
required under [the proposed] 488.212(a)(4).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, one commenter wanted us to insert the words, ``Subject to the provisions of this subpart,'' at the beginning
of the paragraph, and another wanted us to define interrelated deficiencies as deficiencies caused by or resulting
from the same action or occurrence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 4203 and 4213 of OBRA '87 and subsequent related legislation were enacted partially because of the Congress'
recognition that the Secretary and the States needed more flexibility in enforcing regulations pertaining to Medicare
SNFs and Medicaid NFs, and, therefore, more choices of enforcement actions. The selection of a particular remedy
is based on the nature of noncompliance and the remedy (or remedies) that either HCFA or the Medicaid agency believes
is most likely to achieve correction of the deficiencies. We believe that this approach best fulfills the Congressional
mandate to ``promote compliance with the requirements of participation and assure high quality care for nursing
facility residents'' (H.R. Rep. No. 391, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 472 (1987)). In some instances, the most effective
remedy may be two or more remedies. Furthermore, section 1919(h)(1) (A) and (B) of the Act clearly states that this
is the case. The first reads in part, ``*&blank;*&blank;* the State *&blank;*&blank;* may provide *&blank;*&blank;*
for one or more of the other remedies,'' and the second, ``*&blank;*&blank;* the State may provide for one or more of
the remedies.'' Consequently, we are revising &sect;488.402(c) to clearly state that more than one remedy may be
considered appropriate for noncompliance for each deficiency. However, it may also be appropriate for one remedy
to be imposed for multiple deficiencies that constitute noncompliance, and the revised regulation reflects this
policy as well. In any case, the choice of one or multiple remedies for each deficiency constituting noncompliance
is part of the decision making process. The actual imposition of a remedy or remedies is imposed on a facility for noncompliance
as a whole, with participation requirements. We are deleting the limitation in the proposed paragraph (c) that, for
a single remedy for all deficiencies to be imposed, the deficiencies must be interrelated and subject to correction
by the same remedy. This change offers more flexibility to the State survey agencies and to HCFA, and is in keeping with
the statute.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, setting forth specific sanctions to be applied for each deficiency constituting noncompliance or a group
of deficiencies constituting noncompliance would defeat the whole purpose of providing maximum flexibility to
both the Secretary and to the States. We are adopting certain minimum sanctions that will be imposed according to how
serious the noncompliance is, but beyond that, there is enough flexibility to tailor the remedy or remedies to the
specific case at hand.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statutory authority for &sect;488.402(c) is found at sections 1819(h) and 1919(h) of the Act. We have discussed
this statutory authority in both the proposed rule and elsewhere in the preamble of this final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The matter of a potentially large number of follow-up visits is a possibility. If it materializes, State survey agencies
and possibly HCFA's regional offices may require additional resources. We will be closely monitoring implementation
of these regulations to determine the resources needed for this task. However, not every deficiency will require
or even merit a separate revisit for certification of substantial compliance. As stated above, sometimes several
deficiencies will lead to the imposition of only one remedy. Moreover, even if different remedies can be traced to
different deficiencies, the survey agency is under no obligation to make multiple revisits. The noncompliance which
led to the imposition of remedies is due entirely to facility performance. The survey agency is not responsible for
the noncompliance and is under no obligation to spend valuable resources on multiple revisits. Furthermore, remedies
are imposed for noncompliance in a facility, rather than for deficiency ``a'' or ``b'' or ``c,'' etc. The survey agency
is generally obligated to revisit only when the facility makes a credible allegation of compliance with all requirements
and, in some cases, no revisit is required even then.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, we are not adding the phrase, ``Subject to the provisions of this subpart,'' at the beginning of paragraph
(c) because we believe it to be unnecessary. Since we are revising this final rule to allow HCFA or the State to impose
one or more remedies for all deficiencies constituting noncompliance whether they are interrelated or not, there
is no need to define ``interrelated deficiencies.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons given directly above, we are revising &sect;488.402(c) to provide that HCFA or the State may apply
one or more remedies for each deficiency constituting noncompliance, or single or multiple remedies for all deficiencies
constituting noncompliance.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commenters said that they opposed our proposed exemption of deficiencies with scope and severity levels
of 1 from the requirement for a plan of correction. The consensus of these commenters was that all deficiencies should
require a plan of correction. As one commenter remarked:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
While we understand that it is inappropriate to punish or sanction a facility for an isolated, minor deficiency, the
government should ask facilities to correct such problems and there should be a public record of the facility's plan
to do so. Since the regulations and the reform law require compliance with all requirements, there cannot be any exclusions
from completing plans of correction. Plans of correction are a management tool for both the facility and the regulators,
not a penalty or punishment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters said the exception should be retained, but only if HCFA applies a ``substantiality factor'' to the
determination of what constitutes a deficiency. By ``substantiality'' they meant that nothing would be cited as
a deficiency unless it is 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
an isolated or occasional occurrence or unless it has a significant impact on resident rights or quality of life. If
this were the case, they said, then all deficiencies should require a plan of correction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter asked, ``Why cite a deficiency at scope and severity level 1?''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the issue of approval of the plans of correction, one commenter suggested that HCFA approve all plans of
correction. Another suggested we add the following specific language:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
HCFA will or the survey agency must approve the plan of correction if it is reasonably calculated to result in substantial
correction of the deficiency within a reasonable time. Neither HCFA nor the survey agency may disapprove a plan of
correction because the facility denies the existence of the deficiency, if the plan otherwise meets the criteria
specified by this paragraph. The facility may submit an amended plan of correction at any time, and HCFA will or the
survey agency must approve the amended plan if it meets the criteria specified in this paragraph. A facility's submission
of a plan of correction does not constitute an admission that the deficiency exists.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, one commenter said that there is a need for clearer plans of correction, and another said that the plans need
to be more specific and focus on care issues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree that all deficiencies should require either a plan of correction or an agreement to correct, and are revising
this final regulation at &sect;488.408 (``Selection of remedies.'') accordingly. One commenter expressed the
rationale for this succinctly: ``*&blank;*&blank;* the government should ask facilities to correct [deficiencies]
and there should be a public record of the facilities' plan to do so.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We do not accept the suggestion that the regulations specify that HCFA will or the survey agency must approve the plan
of correction if it is reasonably calculated to result in substantial correction of the deficiency within a reasonable
time. We have discussed the meaning of substantial compliance elsewhere in this preamble. As for the terms ``reasonably
calculated'' and ``reasonable time,'' it has been our experience that putting general language such as this in regulations
is not useful. Plans of correction are considered on a case-by-case basis by both the States and by HCFA because circumstances
vary greatly from facility to facility. To state in the regulations that HCFA and the States have a moral and legal responsibility
to be reasonable in their dealings with providers would be to belabor the obvious; there is no need for such a pronouncement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the commenters who proposed that plans of correction be required for all deficiencies made the observation
that some plans of correction do nothing more than complain about the law, the surveyor, or the circumstances, without
ever describing how the violation will be corrected. We agree and would only add that it is highly probable that facilities
submitting these plans considered them to be ``reasonable,'' and extremely improbable that these plans would be
acceptable to HCFA or the State.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, we agree that plans of correction must be clear and specific, but believe that there is no need to state this
in regulations.

We believe this to be unnecessary. We try, to the greatest extent possible, to avoid redundancy in regulations. When

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another commenter suggested that the text of our proposed &sect;488.202(e) be revised to state, ``If the State and
HCFA disagree on the decision to impose remedies when HCFA has performed a validation survey, the disagreement is
resolved in accordance with [proposed] &sect;488.234.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Not allowing HCFA to impose remedies unless and until it has performed its own validation survey would, in most cases,
significantly lengthen the amount of time between the facility's being cited for a deficiency and the time when a remedy
would be imposed. This would not fulfill the intent of the Act, which states that criteria as to when and how each of the
remedies is to be applied ``shall be designed so as to minimize the time between the identification of violations and
final imposition of the remedies *&blank;*&blank;*'' (sections 1819(h)(2)(B) and 1919(h)(2)(B) of the Act). In
any event, the Act does not limit the Secretary's ability to make findings exclusively through the use of validation
surveys. The Act says only that the Secretary may impose sanctions if he or she ``finds'' noncompliance. There may
be occasions, for example, when the Secretary may choose to impose sanctions based on a State agency survey. We have
therefore concluded that the Act did not intend that the Secretary exercise his or her oversight authority only through
Federal onsite validation surveys. Nonetheless, in some cases it will only be possible to draw conclusions about
facility compliance through onsite surveys. Moreover, sections 1819(g)(3)(B) and 1919(g)(3)(B) of the Act require
the Secretary to conduct validation surveys for at least 5 percent of the State survey agency's standard surveys,
as long as the 5 percent equals at least 5 facilities. Therefore, many times the Secretary's enforcement decisions
will arise as a result of Federal validation surveys. However, this will not always be the case.

For the reasons listed immediately above, we are making no revisions to proposed &sect;488.202(e).

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some members of the health care community said that the proposed 2&hyph;4 and 15-day periods are inadequate to allow
facilities a fair opportunity for correcting deficiencies. In addition, commenters suggested that HCFA_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Specify whether the days are calendar days or business days;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Specify that the time frames for correction will not begin until the facility receives the notice, rather than
when notice is sent;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Specify that the notice must be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested or by personal delivery, and
that the State must give the facility notice in the same manner; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Provide an expedited hearing process to safeguard the facility's ability to continue its business and protect
its residents from wrongful government action. This measure must be taken, the commenter said, due to the short notice
we proposed to give in the case of immediate and serious threat.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters said that the time frames we proposed are too long. One of these commenters expressed serious concern,
noting that the Act clearly requires that immediate action be taken to remove the jeopardy in immediate and serious
threat situations. This commenter urged that no notice be given before the imposition of a sanction in these cases,
and suggested that, in nonimmediate and serious threat situations, 5 days notice should be given. Another said that,
in many cases, it is obvious that the remedy should be imposed immediately. This consumer organization asked why a
State survey agency should ever have to delay initiating monitoring visits to a facility or why a facility with widespread
quality of care problems should be allowed to admit new residents for 15 days after such problems are discovered. Other
commenters cited the possible continuance of ``roller coaster compliance'' unless we shorten the time frames. ``Roller
coaster compliance'' refers to the facility practice of coming into compliance only long enough to stave off an impending
remedy, then reverting to noncompliant activities or practices until the next time the deficiencies are cited, when
the cycle begins all over again.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters said that our proposed time frames do not adequately protect residents, referring to monitors as
an example. One said that in a case of jeopardy, the State might feel it necessary to have a monitor in the facility as
the survey team is leaving. Waiting two days without outside scrutiny may be too long under some circumstances.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters said that, in the case of civil money 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalties, notice before an effective date is meaningless, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
since the fine may be imposed for a past violation that has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
already been corrected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter said that the ``not more than four days'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice in &sect;488.402(f) conflicts with &sect;488.410, and another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that paragraph (f) conflicts with &sect;488.330(e)(1)(i) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii). Another said that the clause, ``*&blank;*&blank;* the remedy could be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposed anytime after the minimum 2 day notification period, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but not later than the 10th day after the last day of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey,'' is confusing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, one commenter suggested that residents and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their representatives be notified of enforcement actions and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their implications at the same time the nursing home is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notified. Two other commenters said that States should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to compile, at least monthly, a list of facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against which they have taken adverse action and imposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanctions. They suggested that this listing be sent to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
newspapers, to the State long-term care ombudsman, to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State protection and advocacy agency, to acute care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospitals, and to public and private agencies that regularly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make referrals of individuals to nursing facilities. They 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also suggested that States be required to develop poster 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notices for each intermediate remedy, and require facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to post the notice in a prominent place. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are revising &sect;488.402(f) to specify that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the time frames given are calendar days, and that they begin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when the facility receives the notice, but in no event will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the effective date of the enforcement action be later than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20 days after the notice is sent. We are not accepting the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggestion that the notices be sent via certified mail, with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
return receipt requested. This would preclude a valid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice sent via other means, such as telefax, telegram, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial overnight delivery services, or other means that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be faster. This becomes an especially important 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration in the case of immediate jeopardy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter who asks for an expedited hearing process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
due to the short notice alleging immediate jeopardy seems to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be suggesting that the hearing take place before the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective date of a sanction to safeguard the facility's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ability to continue its business and protect its residents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from wrongful government action. In the case of immediate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jeopardy, this would mean a hearing would have to be held as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
early as the first 48 hours after the survey. It is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entirely possible that, when a survey uncovers such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jeopardy, the State or HCFA may immediately set an effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date at the minimum required time after notice, that is, 2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
days. It is virtually impossible to set up a hearing this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quickly, and expanding the time between the notice and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective date of a remedy to make it possible to hold a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing before the effective date would not be in the best 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interests of the residents. The whole point of a short time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frame is to safeguard the lives and the safety of residents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by taking immediate action. As discussed at proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.180 (now designated as &sect;488.330), Certification of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance or noncompliance, it is not necessary to hold a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing before the effective date of termination to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequately protect a facility's right to due process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, we received comments saying our time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frames were too short, and others saying that they were too 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
long. While we are mindful of the Act's requirement that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary take immediate action in the case of immediate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jeopardy (sections 1819(h)(4) and 1919(h)(4) of the Act), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and to minimize the time between the identification of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violations and final imposition of the other remedies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(sections 1819(h)(2)(B) and 1919(h)(2)(B) of the Act), we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have chosen not to shorten them, except for the same day (if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary) installation of a State monitor in the case of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediate jeopardy. We believe that, for other available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies when there is an immediate jeopardy deficiency, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility should be allowed at least 2 days before imposition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of sanctions. This is because we believe that even in cases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of immediate jeopardy, providers are entitled to some notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before the imposition of sanctions. We believe that, in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
case of non-immediate jeopardy, we should not allow any less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 15 days for similar reasons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We chose not to set the minimum amount of notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required any higher than 2 days in the case of immediate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jeopardy because the longer immediate jeopardy persists, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater the likelihood that actual harm or even death may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result or continue. We have, for the reasons cited in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph immediately preceding determined that a facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be given no less than 2 days before imposition of sanctions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Besides, it has been our experience that, as a practical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
matter, it takes longer than 2 days to complete termination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proceedings once they are begun. It is our belief that we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have struck a fair balance between giving facilities fair 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice and a reasonable chance to correct deficiencies and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fulfilling our responsibility to safeguard the health or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety of residents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have chosen 15 days in the case of nonimmediate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jeopardy by carefully weighing the same considerations. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is important to understand that we are bound by Federal law 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to minimize the time between the identification of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violations and final imposition of remedies. While sections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1819 and 1919 of the Act do not require giving specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice before the imposition of remedies, constitutional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principles of due process generally do require such a notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of agency adverse action. On the other hand, neither the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act nor the Constitution require that providers have the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity to correct deficiencies before sanctions are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposed. In other words, there is a need for prior notice, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but not an entitlement on the providers' part to an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity to correct deficiencies. This policy, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe, satisfies due process concerns of providers. As we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have said, the only exception is the immediate imposition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a State monitor when there is an immediate jeopardy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situation, because, above all else, it is our responsibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to protect the lives of residents. The facility will not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to pay the salary of the State monitor; nor will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State monitor have managerial authority to obligate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility funds. (That authority is reserved for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temporary manager who could be installed a couple of days 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
later.) The State monitor can be appointed immediately, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
while other sanctions are pending during notice periods to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protect residents. With respect to civil money penalties, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we do not believe that any notice is required before HCFA or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a State advises a facility that noncompliance has occurred 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and that a penalty is to be imposed. As the statute clearly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggests, civil money penalties may be imposed for past 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
periods of noncompliance even if a facility is currently in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance. Notice is required, however, before a civil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
money penalty can be 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
collected, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and the regulations call for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exactly this procedure. Like any other commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enterprise, nursing homes must structure their debits and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credits around their cash flow. We believe that notifying a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility that it must pay a civil money penalty instantly is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unfair, unrealistic, and not in accordance with the basic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principles of due process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this final rule, we are removing the provision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requiring a maximum of 4 days notice before the imposition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a sanction in &sect;488.402(f). We may impose a remedy for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediate jeopardy, as &sect;488.410 allows, as long as we give 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the facility at least 2 days' notice before the imposition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the remedy and no more than 23 days from the last day of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the survey to remove the jeopardy or be terminated. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actual practice, the facility is notified that there is an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediate jeopardy deficiency as soon as the survey has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completed. It is only the official notice of the imposition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a remedy that may not be sent until later, as long as it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is received by the facility at least two days before the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective date of the remedy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of our review of these comments, we are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
making final proposed &sect;488.180(e)(1)(i), Certification of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance or noncompliance, because it appears to conflict 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with &sect;488.402(f). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As proposed, we are providing in &sect;488.325(f), that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State must provide the State's long-term care ombudsman with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any report of adverse actions specified at &sect;488.406 imposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on a facility. We believe that this provision will keep 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residents informed about each enforcement action. Whatever 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional publicity States may wish to give notices of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse action is their decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are also revising paragraph (f) to note the

penalties and restructured it to clarify them.

Section 488.404&blank;Factors To Be Considered in Selecting Remedies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We received comments on proposed &sect;488.204, as well as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on our solicitation of comments in the preamble to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule, about the scope and severity measures; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically, we asked for comments on how scope and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
severity values were described and how they were to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assigned. We will address all of the comments we received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on scope and severity in this section of the preamble. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The majority of commenters did not comment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the scope scale. Several commenters expressed support for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using scope and severity scales to determine the enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
response to facility noncompliance. Other commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opposed using these scales. Of those opposed, some believed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the scales, absent any measurable criteria, introduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
another opportunity for surveyor inconsistencies to occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Others thought the scope and severity level definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were too broad and vague to be applied consistently by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveyors, allowing too much government discretion in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selection of remedies, while one commenter believed that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination of remedies should be left to the judgment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the survey agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters argued that the scales were impractical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because they were either too complex or prescriptive and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
left no room for surveyor judgment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters argued that the use of scope and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
severity scales conflict with Congressional intent to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eliminate a hierarchy of participation requirements. They 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contend that by ranking the seriousness, that is, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importance, of a facility's deficiencies, the scope and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
severity scales foster the belief that some requirements are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more important than others. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter questioned why the scope and severity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scales were being put into regulation. This commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believed that codifying the criteria used for determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies is inappropriate and will invite additional legal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
challenges by nursing home providers dissatisfied with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
severity and scope level determinations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter was concerned that the scope and severity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scales failed to provide enough regulatory guidance on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exact criteria that will be used in making remedy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determinations to ensure that the enforcement response is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate to the nature of the noncompliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We received a variety of proposals for reconfiguring the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scope and severity scales from provider organizations, State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governments and consumer advocate organizations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One consumer advocate organization proposed a scope and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
severity scale with three tiers of severity (immediate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jeopardy, substandard quality of care, and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violations), while retaining the definition of scope as we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal called for a plan of correction for all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level 1 deficiencies (other violations) regardless of scope 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and a mandatory civil money penalty for scopes of 3 and 4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the proposal specified that the State or HCFA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must impose a directed plan of correction if the violation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is repeated. All other remedies could be imposed at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
option of the State or HCFA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second tier (substandard quality of care) would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require a civil money penalty, public notice, a plan of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correction and, at the State's option, any other remedy. If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repeated, the State or HCFA would require a State monitor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and a directed plan of correction. There were additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandatory remedies imposed at higher scope levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third tier (immediate jeopardy) would require the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statutorily mandated temporary management and physician and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nursing home administrator licensing board notice, as well 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a denial of payment for new admissions and a plan of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another organization also proposed three severity levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Actual harm, impairment or death; potential harm, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impairment and death; and negative outcome). The scope 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels were also pared down to three levels (isolated, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occasional and widespread/pattern). Substandard quality of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
care would be defined as a severity of 2 with a scope of 3 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in quality of care and all of severity level 3. For non-immediate jeopardy, this proposal would require termination

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in 180 days from the last date of survey unless compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is achieved during the correction period. For immediate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jeopardy, termination would take effect in 23 days if no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temporary manager is appointed or accepted. This proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not require any mandatory fines but rather, would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leave the choice of remedy to the State or HCFA. Other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statutorily driven remedies have also been included in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One State organization proposed a matrix which had five 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
severity levels (harm or death; negative outcome non-staff 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action; negative outcome staff action; negative outcome 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likely; and no negative outcome). As in some other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposals, the scope levels remained as we had provided in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed rule. Under this plan, no remedies would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposed for severity level of 1 and scope of 1 or severity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level of 1 and scope of 2 or severity level of 2 and scope 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 1. A plan of correction would be required for a severity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and scope of 1&hyph;3, 1&hyph;4 and 2&hyph;2, respectively. A civil money 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty would be imposed for a severity and scope of 2&hyph;3 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2&hyph;4. No fine would be imposed for a scope of 1, even if a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiency is at the severity of 3 or 4. Denial of payment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for new admissions would only be imposed for severity levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 4 and 5 (except severity 4 and scope of 1). This plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also would exempt facilities from any remedies in certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situations where new requirements had not been disseminated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to nursing homes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another State organization proposed a scope and severity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scale using the four scope levels defined in our proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule, but defining the severity levels differently. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
four severity levels would be defined as level 4_life 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threatening harm or death; 3_actual harm; 2_potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harm; and 1_no harm or likelihood of harm. Severity and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scope of 1 would have no remedies imposed. Severity level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 1 and scope of 2 and severity of 2 and scope of 1 or 2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would have no remedy imposed the first time the deficiency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was cited, but the State or HCFA would impose a directed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan of correction if the same deficiency(ies) was found at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the next survey. This plan also requires the State or HCFA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to choose between a denial of payment for new admissions or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a civil money penalty for severity levels of 3 and 4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another State disagreed with our use of the term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediate jeopardy relative to the scales because it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that the term, as described for the scales, carries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no connotation of immediacy and is not equivalent to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
language ``likely to cause at any time'' we had proposed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the definition of the term in &sect;488.201 of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule. Also, the State questioned our definition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substandard quality of care in relationship to severity and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scope. It believed that substandard quality of care should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not apply to one or two residents but should reflect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficient patterns of care, policies or procedures present 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in or used by the facility. The State recommended that HCFA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide that a finding of substandard quality of care may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made (but is not required) for scope levels of 1 and 2 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
severity levels of 3 and 4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters suggested that severity levels 3 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4 should be redefined. Specifically, these commenters found 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
virtually no difference in the application of remedies in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the two levels. Other commenters believed that a potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for life threatening harm should not be an immediate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jeopardy finding subject to harsher remedies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters disagreed that facilities be furnished 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with a separate summary of all level 1&hyph;1 deficiencies rather 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than receiving notice of them on the official deficiency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement. They believed that it would be confusing to have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a facility's deficiencies recorded, in parts, between two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate documents, as well as harder to track repeat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies at the next standard survey. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters made specific recommendations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required remedies for various levels of severity and scope. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some suggested that HCFA or the State only impose a plan of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correction at the lower scope and severity levels, while 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other commenters wanted HCFA to mandate civil money 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalties and other remedies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many consumer advocates expressed concern that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed scope and severity scales did not represent the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intent of the Congress to make resident rights and physical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment requirements equivalent to quality of care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. They contend that the way the scales are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently written, resident rights and physical environment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies would never rise above severity level 2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters believe that the scope and severity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scales should be predicated on a statistical analysis of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
probability and suggest that this could be done by health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
care professionals who could factor into the scales the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
predisposition of a given individual to a particular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incident. Many commenters asked that the ambiguous terms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used within the level descriptions be defined, for example, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
how many cases constitute ``in a number of cases.'' One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter suggested that a numerical or percentage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination be made to clarify the terms, for example, 1&hyph;3 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instances = isolated, or less than 17 percent occurrences = isolated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that the scope scale include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only three levels, combining the proposed levels 3 and 4 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because there was no distinction for the remedies. Another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter observed that the scope scale level descriptions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were written in terms of the number of times that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveyors made a particular observation, and contended that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
while this approach may be appropriate for certain types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problems, it is not for others. For example, when surveying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for life safety code compliance, what scope would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assigned to a total sprinkler system failure? This problem 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is a single observation, but it is one that affects every 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resident in the facility. This commenter, therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested that if we are to accurately reflect the extent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the deficiency, then scope should be based on the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residents who are affected by the deficient practice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Overall, many commenters feared that the scope and severity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scales, as proposed, give the enforcing agency virtually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unlimited discretion in selecting remedies. They contended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the proposed scheme does not limit imposition of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most onerous remedies only to the most serious deficiencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and they, therefore, suggest that a prescriptive approach be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developed for correlating deficiencies and remedies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Historically, the enforcement system was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on a hierarchical set of requirements called 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions of participation, standards, and elements. Each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition of participation included groups of standards, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards were made up of separate elements. Enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was based on the level of the requirement for which a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiency was cited. For example, condition-level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies in a SNF resulted in the initiation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
termination procedures or a denial of payment for new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
admissions. However, if only standard-level deficiencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were found, only a plan of correction was required. Since 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Congress has expressly eliminated the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hierarchical requirements in nursing homes, we needed an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organized way to determine how serious a facility's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies are, as well as a consistent approach to guide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcing agencies in making enforcement decisions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We believe that we have implemented the Congress' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandate to abandon our pre-OBRA hierarchical requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and to develop a system capable of detecting and responding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to deficiencies in any participation requirement. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcement scheme provided in this final rule is built on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the assumption that all requirements must be met and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforced and that requirements take on greater or lesser 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significance depending on the circumstances and resident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outcomes in a particular facility. In addition, we wish to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emphasize that measuring the seriousness of deficiencies is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only for the purpose of determining the enforcement response 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most appropriate for specific degrees of noncompliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to grant the statutory flexibility given to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA and the States to design their own enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approaches (with guidance from the Secretary), we are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing a modified enforcement scheme to be used to assess 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the seriousness of deficiencies and then used to select an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcement response. The scheme requires that specified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors be considered by HCFA or the State to assess the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seriousness of a facility's deficiencies, and it correlates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seriousness to specific enforcement responses. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the exception of the immediate jeopardy level, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcing agencies may exercise the flexibility to design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their own methods of interpreting and applying the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment factors to the identified deficiencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Historically, determinations of immediate jeopardy to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resident health or safety have been made by HCFA and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States in accordance with guidance provided in Appendix Q of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State Operations Manual. We conclude that there is no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compelling reason for States to redefine this level of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance. The enforcing agencies may also exercise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their statutory authority to determine whether an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative remedy is or is not preferable to termination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining the seriousness of Life Safety Code (LSC) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies, States are encouraged to apply the Fire Safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Evaluation System (FSES), which is Appendix C of the 1985 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
edition of the LSC. Since the FSES is an equivalency system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on point values, it is possible to utilize the system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to document the seriousness of deficiencies on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantitative basis in accordance with the revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcement matrix. Once the seriousness of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies is determined and the decision to impose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative remedies instead of, or in addition to, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
termination, HCFA or the State must make its remedy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selection from the remedy category associated with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific level of noncompliance. This correlation is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided in &sect;488.408 of this final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This approach has the added benefit of promoting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
national consistency because all systems will be considering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the same initial assessment factors, and the remedy choice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will then be based on the nature of the noncompliance and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the corrective action most likely to achieve correction and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continued compliance. In other words, we developed, for use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the States and by HCFA, an organized and consistent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method by which to first, determine how serious a facility's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies are, and second, to select an enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
response from a specified remedy category linked to that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
degree of noncompliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe that the enforcement scheme we are providing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in this final rule for HCFA and the States to use in rating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies and selecting remedies satisfies a variety of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerns posed by the former scope and severity scale and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed rule in general. Under the proposed rule, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
set out two scales, one for scope and one for severity, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA and the States were to apply in determining which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedy to apply once deficiencies were identified. While 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the rule provided some definition for each of the levels of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scope and severity, HCFA and the States were essentially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
free to determine what constituted a ``sufficient'' number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``repeated observations'' in concluding whether or not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``pattern'' of deficiencies could be said to exist. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the final rule, we have removed the scope and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
severity scales, as such, and have replaced them with a set 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of criteria that must be used (should a decision be made to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impose alternative remedies at all) to select an enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedy. Specifically, while the enforcement scheme in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule is conceptually the same as the former scope and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
severity scales, it differs from that approach in numerous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant ways: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;It leaves to the judgment of both HCFA and the States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether to impose alternative remedies at all, regardless of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the seriousness of a facility's deficiencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;It incorporates the concept of substantial compliance, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whereby deficiencies found which constitute no more than a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential for minimal harm are not sanctioned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;With the exception of immediate jeopardy, a State may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use its own method for interpreting terms that describe the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relative frequency or seriousness of deficiencies as long as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it is consistent with the guidance presented in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;It correlates, to a greater extent than in the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule, specific enforcement categories from which an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcement response must be selected with specified degrees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of noncompliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;It can be applied to physical environment deficiencies, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as well as to all others, and it should relieve commenters' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fears that resident rights violations and physical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment deficiencies could not be considered as serious 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Providers will have a clearer idea of the enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consequences they could be subject to for specific degrees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of noncompliance because, in &sect;488.408, we have correlated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcement categories with levels of noncompliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The establishment of these remedy categories will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide regulatory guidance to HCFA and the States in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selecting remedies and will necessitate that States and HCFA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clearly define the seriousness of cited deficiencies in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order to select an appropriate remedy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have not accepted any of the commenters' proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revisions to the scope and severity scales for inclusion in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the modified enforcement scheme in this final rule. After 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reviewing the proposals, we concluded that, while the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminology may have been different, all of the proposals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were conceptually the same as the scales that were published 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the proposed rule. In addition, those commenting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided no evidence (for example, success data) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to indicate that their respective proposed enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems would be more effective than the scales we published 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the proposed rule. We, therefore, have not adopted any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the commenters' proposals in place of the enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
model we are presenting in this final rule. In addition and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equally noteworthy, we spent considerable time meeting with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various groups representing the nursing home industry, State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies and consumer organizations to discuss and seek 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
input on the various approaches to restructure and refocus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the survey and enforcement processes. The resulting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach was presented in the notice of proposed rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as well as in what has been carried over into this final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to concerns that repeated 1&hyph;1 deficiencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(now referred to as isolated deficiencies that HCFA or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State determines constitute no actual harm with a potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for minimum harm) would be hard to monitor on subsequent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveys, we note that, while such deficiencies are not cited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the official deficiency statement and are not sanctioned, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their existence is maintained in the official provider file 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
along with the official deficiency statement. The separate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listing of these deficiencies is also accessible to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveying agency and disclosable to the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While we intend that the enforcement scheme provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
internal guidance to States and to HCFA, we are including it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the regulations to provide the public, and particularly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulated facilities and facility residents, with full 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disclosure as to how enforcing agencies will determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate remedies for providers that have been found out 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of compliance with Federal participation requirements.

 One commenter wanted a remedy to be imposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for insufficient nurse staffing.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The law requires that nursing homes meet all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation requirements. Should noncompliance with nurse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
staffing requirements be identified, either during an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extended survey or when a waiver of RN and/or licensed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nursing staffing has been requested or granted, the facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be subject to an enforcement response from HCFA or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State, just as it would be for other instances of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 Some commenters wanted to remove the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distinction between initial and secondary factors in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.404 (proposed at &sect;488.208) believing that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
secondary criteria are equally important as the initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The secondary factors are not less important; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they just come later in the process of selecting an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate remedy or remedies. However, we are replacing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the word ``secondary'' with the word ``other'' to avoid any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further confusion. The first step is to assess the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seriousness of the deficiency(ies), including the presence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or absence of immediate jeopardy, to determine the minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended categories of remedies to impose, as well as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested optional categories from which to choose. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other factors (that is, the relationship of one deficiency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to other deficiencies, and the facility's prior compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
history in general and specifically with reference to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cited deficiencies) assist in making choices from among all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies available in any of the categories applicable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific deficiencies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Other commenters want the compliance history 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the facility to remain secondary because facilities with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a change of ownership and/or personnel may not be able to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
otherwise emerge positively due to poor compliance in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
past. It was suggested that we change &sect;408.404 (proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at &sect;488.208) accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We did not revise the regulations text to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflect this suggestion. A facility's prior compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
history should be considered regardless of a change in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ownership. A facility is purchased ``as is.'' The new owner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acquires the compliance history, good or bad, as well as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assets. While we agree that after consideration of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility's compliance history, HCFA or the State may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conclude that such history is no longer a valid predictive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factor of the facility's ability to achieve and maintain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance (for example, following a change of ownership 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where the new owner ``cleans house'') the burden of proof is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the new owner to demonstrate that poor past performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no longer is a predictive factor.

 Other commenters wanted additional factors to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be considered in addition to those outlined in &sect;488.404 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(proposed at &sect;488.208). The suggestions for additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Whether the deficiency or deficiencies are directly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
related to resident care; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The corrective, long-term compliance, resident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protective, and non-punitive outcomes sought by the agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The facility's degree of culpability; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The accuracy, extent, and availability of facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The facility's financial condition; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Any adverse effect that the remedy would have on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health and safety of facility residents; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Whether there has been a change in ownership or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation of the facility; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The facility's action to correct the deficiency prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the conclusion of the survey.

Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 While we are not expanding &sect;488.404 to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include these additional factors, there is nothing to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preclude HCFA or the State from considering any other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors they believe to be relevant in the decision-making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process. We are, however, revising &sect;488.404(b) to clarify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the other factors that HCFA and the State may consider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include, but are not limited to, only those factors listed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because we do not want to limit valid assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considerations unnecessarily, we do not desire to provide an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all-inclusive list. We realize that it is impossible to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
predict every factor that would have a bearing on every 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular case. The two factors that we have included in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the regulatory model have a direct bearing on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination of the most appropriate remedy or remedies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have explained above how the interrelationships among 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies can impact the decision to impose one as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opposed to several remedies. The second factor, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility's prior compliance history, is pertinent because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sections 1819(h)(2)(B), 1919(h)(2)(A), and 1919(h)(3)(C) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act provide for increased penalty amounts for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uncorrected or repeated noncompliance. Moreover, sections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1819(h)(2)(E) and 1919(h)(2)(D) of the Act require the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposition of the denial of payment remedy for repeated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substandard quality of care.

 One commenter didn't believe that surveyors

should make binding decisions regarding remedies, but rather 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this authority should be retained by the surveyors'

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Surveyors do not have the authority to make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
binding enforcement determinations; rather, either HCFA or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State makes binding enforcement determinations in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Section 488.406&blank;Available Remedies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While analyzing the comments for this section, we again 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reviewed the provisions of the Act to ensure conformance in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the final regulation. In doing so, we noted that proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.206(c) did not include the remedies of civil money 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalties, temporary management, and closure of the facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and transfer of residents, or their equivalents, in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listing of available remedies. We have also clarified that, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regardless of what other additional remedies a State may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have approved, the State must establish, at a minimum, those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified remedies, or an approved alternative to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified remedy, that is, termination, State monitoring, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
denial of payment for new admissions, closure of a facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the State in emergency situations and/or transfer of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residents, civil money penalties, and temporary management. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are correcting this oversight in this final regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, during the process of reviewing and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyzing comments, we added another remedy. This remedy, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directed in-service training, is described in the discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of &sect;488.425. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, since the proposed &sect;488.228, ``Alternative or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional State remedies'', contained virtually the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information as this section, we are eliminating the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.228 and moving the remaining non-duplicative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions to this section. All comments received in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
response to proposed &sect;488.228 are being included and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addressed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One of the major concerns expressed throughout 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the comments was that it should be possible to address many 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or most instances of facility noncompliance through a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
traditional plan of correction. Several commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicated that plan of correction should be added to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
list of possible remedies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A plan of correction is a minimum requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for any facility with deficiencies other than those isolated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies that HCFA or the State determines constitute no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actual harm with a potential for minimal harm, and, as for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other providers and suppliers, it is not considered an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcement remedy. Therefore, while we are clarifying the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation to require that a facility complete and submit a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan of correction each time deficiencies are noted (other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than those isolated deficiencies that HCFA or the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determines constitute no actual harm with a potential for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimal harm), we are not adding plan of correction to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listing of available remedies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Many commenters expressed concerns that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed remedies are punitive rather than corrective in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nature, excessively burdensome in relationship to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies, too harsh or that they will direct the focus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
away from resident care, thereby having a negative effect on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
long term care. Some commenters stated that the remedies do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not allow for one time digressions from a facility's history 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of compliance. Others believed that the proposed remedies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would threaten job security for nursing home staff or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
security of facility residents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As indicated in response to the previous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment, many commenters assumed that it was not possible to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a plan of correction as the only corrective measure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required in a facility, even when the deficiencies were of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
low degree of seriousness. In this final regulation, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acknowledge that a traditional plan of correction may be the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only measure needed to correct deficiencies in some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities which have only lower level deficiencies. While 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we believe that using plans of corrections in this fashion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should alleviate some of the concerns expressed by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters, we do not accept the notion that the use of more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
severe remedies for more severe deficiencies is excessive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There can be little question that the Congress was concerned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about what it concluded was an unsatisfactory enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scheme prior to nursing home reform. As a result, it wrote 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into the law a series of remedies that it expects to be used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should circumstances at individual facilities warrant. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
driving force behind the legislation in this context was to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide the Secretary and the States with the authority to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aggressively enforce the Act's new requirements in a way 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that would discourage facility noncompliance that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress believed to be widely evident between surveys, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thereby, to encourage lasting compliance. The design of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these enforcement rules provides for incrementally more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
severe remedies as cited noncompliance is more egregious. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We do not believe that an enforcement approach styled this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
way is harsh or excessive.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Six commenters suggested that the regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include a remedy which would allow a ban on all admissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to a facility, regardless of the resident's source of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment. Three commenters further indicated that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedy should be mandatory in cases involving immediate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jeopardy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We cannot accept these suggestions. The Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not provide the authority to ban admissions for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residents whose source of payment is other than Medicare or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid. The Act does provide for the remedies of denial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of all payment for SNFs and NFs by the Secretary and for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
denial of payment for all new admissions for SNFs by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary, and for NFs, by the Secretary or the States. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule included denial of payment for all new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
admissions in certain diagnostic categories or requiring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specialized care, but we have not included that remedy in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this final rule for the reasons discussed under ``Denial of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Payment'' later in this preamble. We believe that these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies, along with the other available remedies for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance, should be sufficient to promote a shift from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance to substantial compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two commenters stated that the option of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closing the facility should be available for SNFs and not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
just for those facilities that participate as NFs or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SNF/NFs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For SNFs, HCFA has termination as an option 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for remedying noncompliance. While HCFA can terminate a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SNF's Medicare participation, it cannot revoke a facility's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
license to operate within a State. Therefore, actual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closures of facilities and transfers of residents are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies which are options only for those facilities for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the State is the enforcing agency because the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also has licensing authority; closures of facilities are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
license related actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter proposed that off-site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring be added to the list of available remedies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are not accepting this suggestion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Enforcement remedies are designed to motivate providers to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieve and maintain compliance with participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. The motivation is provided by the nature of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the various available enforcement remedies that either 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require some action to be taken by the provider or that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involve financial consequences directly or indirectly to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provider. Since off-site monitoring would be performed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State rather than imposed on the facility, and since 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there would be no responsibility and, therefore, no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incentive for a facility response, we conclude that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
type of monitor is not an enforcement remedy to be imposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against facilities with deficiencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter proposed the addition of State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Secretarial authority to order the hospitalization of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residents in cases involving immediate jeopardy, if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility is unable or unwilling to respond to the residents' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We do not believe an additional remedy is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needed in order to respond to this commenter's concern. As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temporary management will be imposed in those cases where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediate jeopardy is identified in a facility that will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be terminated immediately, control of the situation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including determinations as to the care of individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residents, will be shifted away from the facility's own 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management until the jeopardy is removed. Should the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility fail to relinquish control to the temporary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manager, termination will result and residents will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transferred to facilities that are able to provide care in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manner consistent with certification requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

included as an available remedy.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Public notices are already required by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation for any SNF termination. Public notices are also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowed, but not required (unless the State has its own 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public notice requirement), for NFs that will be subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
termination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We do not believe that the regulation should expand the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of public notices as a remedy for noncompliance by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including them in this section's listing. Public notices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are frequently costly, and they do not always serve the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intent of notifying the widest possible audience of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility's noncompliance. Further, facilities are already 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to post the availability of the results of their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveys on their premises. Accordingly, we are not adopting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this suggestion in the final regulation.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few commenters indicated that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prohibition of nurse aide training and competency evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs (NATCEPs) is a penalty which should be included in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the listing of available remedies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The prohibition of a NATCEP is predicated on, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
among other things, the existence of a nurse staffing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waiver, the fact that a facility has been subject to an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extended or partial extended survey, or the imposition of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse action, including termination of the provider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement. The enforcement remedies, on the other hand, are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the consequences of facility noncompliance once deficiencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been identified through the survey process. While the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disapproval of a NATCEP is automatic when criteria set forth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the Act are met, the imposition of remedies is a matter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requiring some discretion on the part of HCFA or the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is possible for a facility with a nurse staffing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waiver to be surveyed and have no deficiencies identified or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have no deficiencies found which cause the facility to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
out of compliance. In these cases, an enforcement action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not be in order, even though other provisions of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act and regulations would require that a prohibition of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NATCEP be imposed. Further, it would be possible for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility with no nurse staffing waiver, which had not been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to an extended or partial extended survey, to have a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
civil money penalty imposed as a remedy for deficiencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified. In this latter case, the civil money penalty is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the enforcement remedy, and not the prohibition of a NATCEP, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which is an automatic statutory consequence of the civil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
money penalty being imposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because we believe that the Act, as well as regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published on September 26, 1991, separately address how the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State arrives at the disapproval of a NATCEP as opposed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
how it or HCFA determines that an enforcement action is in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order, we are not adopting these comments in the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter indicated that denial of payment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for new admissions for certain diagnostic categories is too 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difficult to implement or monitor. Another stated that it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is too broadly defined and that it was not the intention of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act to modify remedies included in the Act.

The first comment is discussed in detail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under ``Denial of Payment'' later in this preamble.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the comment that the Act does not allow for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modifications of its listed remedies, we point to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of the Act at sections 1819(h)(2)(B), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1919(h)(2)(A), 1919(h)(2)(B)(ii) and 1919(h)(3)(C), all of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which indicate that remedies other than those specified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act are allowed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters asked that the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available remedy of denial of payment for new admissions for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain diagnostic categories be amended to ensure that it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not promote discrimination against residents a facility does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not want to admit. Both indicated that a directed plan of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correction should be required in these situations, and one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment further stated that the directed plan of correction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should direct the facility on how to regain the capability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to care for residents with the designated diagnoses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Five commenters indicated that HCFA should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specify in the regulation the criteria by which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary will determine whether a State's alternative or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional remedies are as effective in determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance and correcting deficiencies as the remedies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified in the Act. Other commenters insisted that any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative or additional remedies must be made available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for public comment before adoption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree that there is a need for uniformity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the process which is used to approve State remedies which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are alternative or additional to those included in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation. While we will prepare manual instructions that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will address how these reviews and approvals should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processed, we believe such information is not appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the text of the regulation itself since it would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impossible to contemplate the vast array of alternatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that States might propose. The Act does not require and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA will not require specific public notice procedures that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit State prerogatives in the State plan amendment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter indicated that States should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
able to develop and implement additional or alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies unless HCFA can demonstrate that the States' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies are not as effective as the HCFA remedies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We cannot adopt this comment. The Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides, at section 1919(h)(2)(B)(ii), that the State must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate to the Secretary's satisfaction that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative or additional remedies it proposes are as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective in deterring noncompliance and correcting the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance as those included in the Act. To shift the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burden of proof to HCFA would be contrary to the Act's clear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instruction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter indicated that any State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies approved as alternative or additional remedies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should apply to SNF/NFs as well as NFs, unless HCFA takes a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different action based on a validation survey. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The determination of whose remedies prevail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a dually participating facility is made in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with section 1919(h)(7) of the Act and codified at &sect;488.452 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter indicated that the final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should clarify and refer to the relationship of these rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the sanctions available under section 1128 of the Act and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to how the Office of Inspector General's (OIG) actions will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have an impact on enforcement actions taken under this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The provisions of sections 1819(h) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1919(h) of the Act, for which HCFA takes action, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision of section 1128 of the Act, for which the OIG 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
takes action, are two independent sources of enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority that are triggered by separate considerations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1128 of the Act contains mandatory and permissive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusions which are, for the most part, applied in cases of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals and entities who have been charged with or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
convicted of certain types of behavior (such as fraud and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
abuse, and obstruction of investigation) under Federal or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State law. Section 1128 does not generally apply to cases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of facility noncompliance, which are covered under sections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1819 and 1919 of the Act that specify survey and enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions. Section 1128A is cited in sections 1819 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1919 to give guidance on the imposition of civil money 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalties which will be imposed in accordance with common 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statutory provisions by HCFA and OIG for their respective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes. If a case happens to involve both noncompliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and fraud, abuse or obstruction of investigation, each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency has the authority to take separate action, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
independently of the other. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters from several States indicated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their States had effective remedies that should be adopted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without change. One commenter stated that HCFA approval of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative or additional remedies should not be required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act gives the States the option of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requesting that HCFA authorize the adoption of existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State remedies. The regulation follows the Act, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leaves the decision to request the adoption of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies up to each State. However, the Act provides that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA approval is necessary and that the State must bear the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burden of proof that any alternative or additional remedies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are as effective as the remedies specified in the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters were concerned that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State's ability to impose alternative remedies instead of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
termination was impaired by the proposed provision that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would require the repayment of the Federal share of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid payment (FFP) if the correction of the deficiencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was not made in accordance with the approved plan and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
timetable. These commenters said that the regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should allow States to enter into agreements under which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities would agree to repay States, which would then 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repay the Federal government FFP if compliance was not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieved according to the approved plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Neither the Act nor the proposed or final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations prevent the States from entering into agreements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with facilities to repay States if the facility fails to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adhere to its plan of correction. The Act is silent on this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue. Therefore, it follows that the States have the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
option to consider such agreements with facilities. Many 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities may find such agreements preferable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
termination.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter stated that the authority to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement alternative or additional remedies should rest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the single State agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act gives the States the authority to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elect alternative or additional remedies through the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Medicaid State plan process. Medicaid regulations at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;431.10 specify that a single State agency administer or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supervise the administration of the State plan. In most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, the Medicaid agency is the single State agency that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implements the current transitional enforcement remedies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against Medicaid facilities. In some States, enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies, such as civil money penalties, are implemented by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the survey agency. We believe that States should retain the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flexibility to organize their enforcement activity as they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deem necessary as long as the organizations meet Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations.

One commenter believed that every State should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement the same penalty system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We cannot accept this suggestion because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act permits the States to elect alternative or additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies if they can demonstrate that the alternative or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional remedies are as effective as the remedies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified by the Act. Further, section 1919(h)(2)(A) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act provides that the State shall specify criteria, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to when and how each remedy is to be applied, the amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any fines, and the severity of each of these remedies, to be

used in the imposition of such fines.

The comments we received on this section, as it was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed, which relate to the factors considered when making

remedy determinations, have already been included and

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters were uncertain about how the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``determination'' of remedies in &sect;488.404 and the ``choice'' of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies in &sect;488.408 differ. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are retitling &sect;&sect;488.404 and 488.408 to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Factors to be considered in selecting remedies'' and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Selection of remedies,'' respectively, and are revising the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
content of both sections as a result of the revision to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria for selecting among enforcement options as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussed earlier in this preamble. After the survey team 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has determined that a deficiency or deficiencies exist, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is required to determine the seriousness of the violations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The factors that HCFA and the States must and may consider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in determining the seriousness of a facility's deficiencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be found at &sect;488.404. The optional process of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining the most appropriate enforcement action is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described at &sect;488.408, which correlates the level of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance with a required and/or optional category of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies.

A few commenters wanted HCFA to include a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement from the preamble of the proposed rule that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asserts ``the more pervasive or severe the facility's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shortcomings, the more severe the penalty.''

Some commenters wanted HCFA to explain the

purpose of intermediate sanctions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of an intermediate sanction (or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative remedy) is to motivate providers to achieve and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintain substantial compliance before termination becomes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary. Prior to OBRA '87, the term ``intermediate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanction'' was limited to a denial of payment for new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
admissions. Sections 1819(h) and 1919(h) of the Act specify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that remedies for noncompliance are to be imposed in lieu 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of, or in addition to, the remedy of termination of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility's participation in the programs. This legislation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expanded the range of alternative remedies for the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the State to use as an incentive for correction and as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
way that might avoid termination of the provider agreement.

A few commenters wanted to revise &sect;488.408 to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require that HCFA and the State make appropriate remedy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selections, but not select a specific remedy solely to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
punish the facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternative remedies are designed to motivate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providers to comply quickly with the requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation. While some providers may view the remedies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as punishment, our first responsibility is to protect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health and safety of the residents. We are interested in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
motivating providers to achieve and maintain compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with health and safety requirements so that they may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continue to provide quality services to the residents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the selection of an enforcement action is based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on that which is most likely to elicit a prompt response 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the facility to achieve and maintain compliance before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
termination becomes necessary. We believe the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change does not significantly add to the process of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selecting remedies; therefore, we are not incorporating it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the final regulation.

A few commenters wanted a definition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``clusters of deficiencies'' included in &sect;488.408, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deals with the initial assessment of the seriousness of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies. Other commenters wanted instruction on which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies are cited as a cluster versus those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies cited individually. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We have removed the reference to clusters in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this final rule because we do not want to limit the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discretion HCFA and the States have been given by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statute to make enforcement decisions. We believe that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relationship between and among deficiencies is inherent in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedy determinations and should be made on a case-by-case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis. While we do not intend to include instructions in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this final rule on which deficiencies would be treated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individually and which would be consolidated, we will offer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examples in the HCFA Regional Office Manual and the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operations Manual of how deficiencies could be grouped 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
together.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We received many general comments about how 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA should be more specific in its guidance on selecting an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate remedy. This guidance must help determine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria for the selection of remedies and must require the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of specific remedies for particular deficiencies. Some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of these commenters suggested a scope and severity scale 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
linked with specific remedies at specific levels.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While we agree with the above commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advocating more guidance on the selection of remedies, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have developed an enforcement scheme capable of doing just 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that, we are bound by the statutory provisions giving HCFA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the States some discretion in designing their own 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
schemes within a Federal framework. Therefore, we are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing the method by which facility deficiencies, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including physical environment deficiencies, will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measured, and we are linking specific categories of remedies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with certain levels of noncompliance. We are revising 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.408 accordingly.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters believe that level 1&hyph;1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies, now referred to as isolated deficiencies which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA or the State determines constitute no actual harm with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a potential for minimal harm, must be cited and a plan of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correction required. Additionally, these commenters urge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that every deficiency should be cited before leaving the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility. They believe that unless each deficiency is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cited, important patterns of repeat noncompliance can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
missed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We disagree. As we stated in the preamble to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed rule, providers must be aware that they are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsible for complying with all participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. Notifying the facility of this level of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiency acknowledges that a problem could potentially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occur if the deficiency is permitted to go uncorrected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While no formal plan of correction is required for this low 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level deficiency and no remedy is applied, correction is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary nevertheless. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exit conference focuses primarily on the most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
serious preliminary findings by the surveyors. While the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey team documents its observations relative to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey, the surveyors' findings are not official until the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provider receives the official deficiency statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters commended HCFA for prohibiting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities from challenging the choice of remedy or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies. These commenters assert that giving the facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the right to challenge the existence of deficiencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequately protects their rights. A few commenters agreed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the choice of the remedy should not be appealable but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the scope and severity of a deficiency should be. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters believed providers should be permitted to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formally appeal both the existence of a deficiency as well 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as challenge determinations of scope and severity and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedy imposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The most important issue on which to grant an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appeal is the existence of deficiencies which lead to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedy. We are requiring that such an appeal before an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative law judge be offered, and that dispute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resolution procedures be applied first, at the request of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the provider. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Providers have the opportunity to appeal certifications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of noncompliance leading to an enforcement remedy but, with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the one exception noted below, do not have the opportunity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to appeal either the level of noncompliance or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcement choice made by HCFA or the State. We have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reached this conclusion for several reasons. First, as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general matter, whether HCFA or a State chooses one remedy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or another to address facility noncompliance is a matter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that we believe is a prosecutorial prerogative of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
government, not with the provider of services. It is an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inherent function of government in this context to make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
choices as to which kind of enforcement action will best 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieve prompt compliance so that residents face 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliant conditions for as short a time as possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, in the case of provider agreement terminations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
even if a facility were able to successfully contest a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conclusion that immediate jeopardy exists, the agency could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
still proceed with the termination action since the agency's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority to bring such an action is not limited to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediate jeopardy cases, but may span all noncompliant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility behavior. As has been agency policy for many 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years, the determination of what remedy to seek is beyond 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
challenge in light of the government's fundamental necessity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to protect the welfare of facility residents as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expeditiously as possible. This is especially the case with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respect to provider agreement terminations since residents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be at considerable risk even where there is no immediate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jeopardy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, in the case of most alternative sanctions, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations are structured so that whether a facility's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance falls in category 1 or category 2, HCFA and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the States have complete discretion to choose from either 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
category. Thus, even if a facility were able to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
successfully demonstrate that the agency had erred in its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conclusion that the noncompliance belonged in category 1, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that fact would be irrelevant since noncompliance in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
category 1 could still trigger the same remedy. Only a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
showing that the facility was in substantial compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would enable the facility to avoid sanctions, and it is this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue that we agree must be subject to challenge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fourth, with respect to the imposition of temporary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management, a facility facing this remedy would have the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity to argue during informal dispute resolution that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the agency had erred in concluding that immediate jeopardy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existed. Should it succeed in making this showing, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedy would not be imposed. On the other hand, should the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility fail to convince agency officials that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance was of a lesser nature, the facility would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
face temporary management well before it could more formally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
challenge the agency finding of immediate jeopardy. Thus, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
even if the facility ultimately prevailed in a hearing in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proving that its noncompliance posed less than immediate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jeopardy, the facility's appeal would not be effective since 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the remedy would have already been imposed and the facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would either have achieved substantial compliance or been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminated by the time of the hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For this reason, we considered whether, in light of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sequence of events, facilities should be given a prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing in temporary management cases, but concluded that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would completely undermine the purpose of this remedy which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is to resolve the most serious noncompliance in the shortest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible time frame. This is particularly the case when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities facing such remedies have available to them an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
informal means to contest agency action prior to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposition of the remedy and when, ultimately, it is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility's choice to accept temporary management rather than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
face termination. Accordingly, we concluded that in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
balancing of interest of facilities and residents in such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cases, the interests of residents must take precedence.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Only in the case of civil money penalties could we see 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the necessity of allowing facilities the opportunity to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
challenge the level of noncompliance since the amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these penalties hinges upon discrete levels of noncompliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rather than noncompliance as a whole. Thus, it may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legally significant to a facility facing a $10,000 per day 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
civil money penalty to be able to prove that its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance belonged in category 2, rather than category 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3, since in category 2 the largest civil money penalty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available to HCF or a State would be $3,000 per day. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, we are revising the rules to allow a facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to challenge the level of noncompliance when a successful 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
challenge on this issue would affect the amount of a civil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
money penalty that HCFA or a State could collect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe that a provider's burden of upsetting survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
findings relating to the level of noncompliance should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
high, however. As we indicated in the proposed rule, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distinctions between different levels of noncompliance, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether measured in terms of their frequency or seriousness, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
do not represent mathematical judgments for which there are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clear or objectively measured boundaries. Identifying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failures in a facility's obligation to provide the kind of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
high quality care required by the Act and the implementing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations most often reflect judgments that will reflect a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
range of noncompliant behavior. Thus, in civil money 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty cases, whether deficiencies pose immediate jeopardy, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or are widespread and cause actual harm that is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediate jeopardy, or are widespread and have a potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for more than minimal harm that is not immediate jeopardy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not reflect that a precise point of noncompliance has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurred, but rather that a range of noncompliance has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurred which may vary from facility to facility. While we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
understand the desire of those who seek the greatest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible consistency in survey findings, an objective that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we share, the answer does not lie in designing yardsticks of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance that can be reduced to rigid and objectively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculated numbers. Survey team members and their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supervisors ought to have some degree of flexibility, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deference, in applying their expertise in working with these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less than perfectly precise concepts. For these reasons, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have revised the regulations to require an administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
law judge or appellate administrative review authority to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uphold State or HCFA findings on the seriousness of facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies in civil money penalty cases unless they are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clearly erroneous.

A few commenters believe it is not sufficient

to simply state that the choice of a remedy is not

appealable and recommend that the regulation explicitly

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 1128(b)(12) of the Act permits the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary to exclude SNFs from Medicare and to direct that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NFs be excluded from Medicaid for failure to grant access to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the applicable survey agencies performing survey and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification functions in accordance with sections 1864(a) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 1902(a)(33)(B) of the Act. Failure to grant access can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certainly be regarded as interference with the activities of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State agency personnel. However, interference with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temporary manager is different. Sections 488.410 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
488.438 specify that if the facility does not agree to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions under which the temporary manager is imposed, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility may refuse to relinquish control to the temporary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Section 488.410&blank;Action When There Is Immediate Jeopardy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In conducting our review of the provisions of the regulation for conformance with the Act, we noted that the Act uses
``immediate jeopardy to resident health or safety'' to describe those situations in which immediate corrections
must be achieved and immediate enforcement action must ensue, while the text of the proposed rule refers to such situations
as ``immediate and serious threat.'' We have attempted to modify the terminology used in the final regulation to consistently
reflect the language of the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters stated that the 23-day timeframe for termination is not included in the Act, that it is too short and
that it does not allow adequate time for corrections. Some suggested that other timeframes, such as 45 days or 90 days,
be used, while others indicated that the 23-day clock should not start until the facility has been given a chance to
undertake corrections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 While the 23-day timeframe is not specified in the Act, HCFA has for many years used a 23-day timeframe for addressing
immediate jeopardy situations encountered in other provider and supplier types. In fact, the enforcement procedures
which were in effect for long term care facilities prior to the implementation of OBRA '87 provisions called for processing
termination actions within 23 calendar days when immediate and serious threat to patient health or safety was documented.
In these cases, if the immediate and serious threat was resolved before the end of the 23 calendar days, the termination
action was lifted entirely, or if the threat was removed but other serious deficiencies remained, the termination
date was extended to allow the facility additional time to correct the remaining deficiencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Our experience in processing noncompliance actions against other facilities and against long term care facilities
(both before and after OBRA '87 implementation) whose deficiencies constitute immediate jeopardy indicates that
23 calendar days is a reasonable amount of time for proper notice to the facility and to the public, as may be required.
Further, it provides the facility sufficient time to react to the immediate jeopardy without unnecessarily lengthening
the amount of time the facility's residents are at risk because of the situation or situations which constitute the
immediate jeopardy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While we appreciate the concerns expressed by the commenters, we are not amending the 23-day timeframe in the final
regulation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Another group of commenters believed that the 23-day timeframe is too long and that, for facilities in which immediate
jeopardy is identified, the requirement should be that corrections be initiated immediately. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 23-day timeframe is not the amount of time the facility has to begin making corrections. Rather, it is the maximum
amount of time available to the facility to resolve the immediate jeopardy. It begins on the last day of the survey.
A facility is ordinarily advised of the existence of immediate jeopardy at the conclusion of the survey which identified
the immediate jeopardy. Most facilities in this situation that want to remain in the Medicare or Medicaid program
will begin to make corrections immediately. Even for those that do not begin making corrections on their own, some
time must be allowed for provision of proper notices, as required by regulation, and/or the appointment of temporary
management. In consideration of these factors and the fact that it is also possible for the enforcement process to
be completed in less than 23 calendar days, we are not adopting these comments in the final regulation.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters asked that the regulation be amended to clarify that 23 calendar days is the maximum amount of time
which a facility will be given to resolve a finding of immediate jeopardy, whether or not temporary management is utilized.
One commenter said that the facility should be given an additional 23 days beyond the termination date during which
a temporary manager would be utilized to attempt to achieve compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We have accepted the first comment. We agree that 23 calendar days is the maximum time allowed for a facility with immediate
jeopardy to resolve the jeopardy. It is not possible for a facility to first be given 23 calendar days to correct deficiencies
pending termination followed by another period of time during which temporary management is utilized in an attempt
to regain compliance.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters cited the 23-day timeframe as a disincentive for the use of temporary management as an alternative
remedy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We do not believe that use of the 23-day timeframe is a disincentive for use of temporary management based on the seriousness
of deficiencies identified at this level as well as the need to take immediate corrective action.

 A number of commenters indicated that the facility should not be given the opportunity to refuse temporary management.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted in the comments and responses for &sect;488.415, facilities will not be offered a formal choice of whether
to accept or refuse temporary management. When HCFA or a State chooses to implement this remedy, a temporary manager
will be installed unless the facility refuses to relinquish control to the temporary manager, in which case, immediate
termination will be sought.

A few comments indicated that there should be an immediate ban on admissions to the facility, large civil money penalties
and/or immediate assignment of a State monitor for these cases.

Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While the Act does not allow for bans on all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
admissions under these or any other circumstances, it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible for the State or HCFA to impose State monitoring as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an additional remedy. While large civil money penalties are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also allowed, they may not be as likely to result in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediate corrections, since they may not be collected until 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the facility has the opportunity for a hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters believed that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation as proposed does not promote the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative remedies in situations involving immediate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jeopardy and argued that this approach does not follow the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spirit of OBRA '87. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act makes a clear distinction between how 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cases involving immediate jeopardy will be handled as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opposed to how all other cases will be handled. The Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires immediate action to remove the jeopardy and correct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the deficiencies through the use of temporary management or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
termination, or both. While it allows for the use of other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies which are in addition to temporary management or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
termination, it is clear that the penalty for a facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with noncompliance which constitutes immediate jeopardy is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended to be swift and severe. The regulation reflects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the intent of the Act; therefore, the use of alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies in addition to temporary management is allowed but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not stressed for immediate jeopardy situations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters asked for a better 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of immediate and serious threat. Others 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicated that the scope and severity scale, as issued for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment in the proposed rule, would lead to many more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instances of immediate jeopardy than are now being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the many comments received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding the proposed scope and severity scale, we are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amending the definition of immediate jeopardy in the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation (see &sect;488.301). In making decisions on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existence of immediate jeopardy, HCFA and the States will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continue to refer to the traditional guidance on this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject which is contained in Appendix Q of the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operations Manual.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter pointed out that the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation does not address who will prevail (HCFA or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State) about whether or not immediate jeopardy exists in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility, and asked for clarification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HCFA always has the option of reviewing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State's compliance determination and making its own decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on the survey agency's survey findings. It is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary for HCFA to conduct its own survey of a facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in order to make a decision as to whether immediate jeopardy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does or does not exist. Whether HCFA's decision is based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its own survey or on a review of the State's findings, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision as to whether or not immediate jeopardy exists is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made pursuant to section 1919(h)(5) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the determination of immediate jeopardy, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether it is the survey agency's or the Secretary's, will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevail.

Two commenters asked that the text of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.410(c)(2)(i) be amended to indicate that the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temporary management is for the purpose of correcting the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies that resulted in a finding of immediate

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are not adopting these comments, as we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe they would provide for a more narrow interpretation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than the Act specifies at sections 1819(h)(4) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1919(h)(5). These sections state that the appointment of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temporary manager shall be for the purpose of removing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jeopardy and correcting the deficiencies. Further, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicated in the comments and responses for &sect;488.415, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temporary management will be removed when the facility is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminated, or when HCFA or the survey agency has determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the facility is in substantial compliance and has the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management capability to ensure continued substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with all requirements. Consistent with sections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1819(h)(2), 1919(h)(2) and (h)(3) of the Act, temporary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management would not necessarily end as soon as deficiencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
causing the immediate jeopardy have been corrected.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Four commenters indicated that HCFA should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopt a procedure utilized in Louisiana, whereby a facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may request sanctions other than a temporary manager and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request may be granted if the State determines that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate plan to correct has been devised by the facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the State can monitor the implementation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility's plan.

As presented, this procedure does not appear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to meet the requirements of the Act which call for immediate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action to remove the immediate jeopardy through termination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or appointment of temporary management, or both. It would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appear that the proposed procedure would allow something 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similar to a directed plan of correction and State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring to replace termination or temporary management as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the remedies for immediate jeopardy cases. Such a policy

Several commenters objected to the requirement

that a denial of payment for new admissions be imposed if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any deficiency remains uncorrected 90 days after the survey. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
They believed that it is illogical to cut off funds after 90 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
days because the funds might be needed to make the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrections. Other commenters said that the regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should allow continued participation with substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance because the 100 percent compliance is impossible

to achieve. Still other commenters made the following

points: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Major physical environment deficiencies may take longer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 90 days to correct; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 1819(h)(2)(D) and 1919(h)(2)(C) of the Act stipulate that the Secretary or the State, respectively, must
impose a denial of payment for new admissions if the facility is not in compliance 3 months after the date that the facility
was noncompliant, regardless of the requirement that is deficient. In answer to the commenter who raised the issue
of substantial compliance, we are revising &sect;488.412(c) to require a mandatory denial of payment for new admissions
when a facility is not in substantial compliance 3 months after the last day of the survey. Therefore, if a facility
is in substantial compliance, it would not be subject to the mandatory denial of payment for new admissions remedy,
or the denial of payment remedy would be lifted if it had already been imposed. Substantial compliance is discussed
in detail earlier in this preamble. The fact that physical environment deficiencies may take longer to correct than
others is an example of facility noncompliance which may not be wholly corrected after the completion of the 6-month
continuation of payment period, but which could be considered substantial compliance if corrective action had progressed
in accordance with the approved corrective action plan and timetable. With respect to the other points raised by the
commenters, &sect;488.330(e) (3) and (4) specify that a facility may appeal the certification of noncompliance
leading to the denial of payment remedy; &sect;488.330, paragraphs (e)(1)(ii) and (e)(2)(ii) specify that, except
for civil money penalties, a pending appeal will not stop the action. Mailing time is included within the 3 months because
the 3 months constitutes a statutory limit. There are neither statutory nor regulatory public notice requirements
with regard to the denial of payment remedy.

&bull;There should be no deficiency if the scope and severity level is 1; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

then a new term should be used for them, such as findings; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Deficiencies with a scope and severity level of 1 should be given to the facility on a separate document and not
be disclosable to the public; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Deficiencies with a scope and severity level of 1 should receive a plan of correction and be disclosable to the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Deficiencies with a scope and severity level of 1 should not receive either a plan of correction or a remedy if
substantial compliance is achieved; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;There is no such thing as an isolated problem. Excusing certain deficiencies as inconsequential sets a disturbing

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;All deficiencies must be corrected; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;No deficiency should be found unless there is a quality of care issue;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

visit; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;HCFA should clarify when a citation becomes a ``repeat deficiency.'' Remedies should be imposed in cases of

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The regulation at proposed &sect;488.212(b)(1) should read ``both the severity level and the scope level
are 2'' rather than 1; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The regulation at proposed &sect;488.212(b)(3) should impose a civil monetary penalty and one or more other
remedies; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;HCFA should provide guidelines regarding what is an acceptable plan of correction; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If a deficiency with a scope and severity level of 1 recurs, HCFA or the State should impose a directed plan of
correction or State monitoring; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The lack of appeal rights on recurring deficiencies with a scope and severity level of 1 will put the State at

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The issue of deficiencies at a severity and scope level of 1 are discussed under &sect;488.408 of this preamble. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are retaining the definition of deficiency at &sect;488.301. A deficiency is failure to meet a participation requirement.
All deficiencies, with the exception of those isolated deficiencies that HCFA or the State determines constitute
no actual harm with a potential for minimal harm, will be displayed on the HCFA&hyph;2567, Statement of Deficiencies
and Plan of Correction, and will require a plan of correction to be tracked by the State survey agency. All deficiencies,
including those isolated deficiencies that HCFA or the State determines constitute no actual harm with a potential
for minimal harm, will be disclosable to the public. However, these low level deficiencies will not be recorded on
the HCFA&hyph;2567 and will not precipitate any enforcement action. We conclude that this approach is reasonable
and practical from both the provider's and the consumer's perspective. To react to low level deficiencies with the
same degree of concern as to those that are more serious is not rational. We believe that providers and consumers will
agree that deficiencies which constitute no actual harm with no more than a potential for minimal harm, and which bear
no relationship to poor care or negative resident outcomes should not detract from actionable noncompliance.

As noted earlier, we addressed these issues under &sect;488.408 of this preamble. Also, in response to the many comments
we received advocating a clearer correlation between levels of noncompliance and types of remedies imposed, we are
making extensive revisions to the scope and severity grid published in the proposed rule. We are, in fact, correlating
categories of remedies to various categories of noncompliance. A revised grid appears below.

Section 488.414&blank;Action When There Is Repeated Substandard Quality of Care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While analyzing the comments for this section, we again reviewed the provisions of the Act to ensure conformance in
the final regulation. Through this process, we noted that this section does not address the portions of the statutory
provisions at sections 1819(h)(2)(E) and 1919(h)(2)(D) of the Act that specify that the denial of payment and monitoring
must continue until the facility has demonstrated that it is in compliance and that it will remain in compliance. Accordingly,
we are modifying this provision to specify that the mandatory denial of payment and State monitoring imposed for the
finding of substandard quality of care on three consecutive standard surveys must continue until the facility has
demonstrated that it has achieved substantial compliance and can maintain substantial compliance over the period
of time specified by HCFA or the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We further noted that the remedy described in section 1819(h)(2)(B)(i) of the Act can be either denial of payment for
all Medicare residents or denial of payment for all new Medicare admissions in a facility. In recognition of this fact,
the regulation is being amended to reflect this distinction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, because the provisions of the Act were in effect prior to the effective date of this regulation, we have had
actual experience processing enforcement actions for facilities with substandard quality of care noted in three
consecutive standard surveys. Our experience pointed out the need for further clarification in this section in two
respects. One of these related to the handling of actions against facilities whose type of program participation
changed during the period of time spanned by the three consecutive standard surveys, and the other related to whether
remedies could be avoided through an allegation of compliance or actual corrections which followed the finding that
there had been repeated substandard quality of care.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In reviewing actual cases, we concluded that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination of repeat substandard quality of care in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certified facility should be made without regard to the type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of program participation involved; that is, any standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveys conducted in the facility for Medicare, Medicaid or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both should be considered. Since the survey process is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same for both Medicare and Medicaid participating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities, there is no reason to consider the facility's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
type of program participation in the determination of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether repeated substandard quality of care has occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These issues are being clarified in &sect;488.414. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also concluded that sections 1819(h)(2)(E) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1919(h)(2)(D) of the Act indicate statutory intent that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific remedies be imposed any time substandard quality of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
care is repeatedly noted. Further, the Congress 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically provided the authority for continuation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these remedies after compliance has been achieved. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress' specific description of how this type of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance must be dealt with clearly sets it apart from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the handling of other cases. Therefore, we have concluded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a facility's allegation of compliance or actual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attainment of compliance following the third consecutive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard survey which found substandard quality of care will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not stop the imposition of the denial of payment or State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring. The remedy may be lifted when the facility has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrated its ability to maintain substantial compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the satisfaction of HCFA or the State. This point is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also being clarified in this section of the regulation.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A number of commenters asked for a clearer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of ``substandard care.'' Some asked whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substandard care and substandard quality of care are one and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the same. Others pointed out that sections 1819(h)(2)(E) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 1919(h)(2)(D) of the Act specify that action is to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taken based on the provision of substandard quality of care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are changing the regulation to match the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act and indicate that this provision will apply when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substandard quality of care is identified. For the purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this provision, substandard quality of care is defined in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.301. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters requested that the word 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``standard'' be inserted between ``consecutive'' and ``surveys.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
They pointed out that the proposed regulation does not match 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the wording of the Act at sections 1819(h)(2)(E) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1919(h)(2)(D), both of which specify that the substandard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality of care must be identified in three consecutive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard surveys. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We agree with the commenters. We are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amending this section to indicate that the repeated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substandard quality of care must have been noted through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three consecutive standard surveys. Standard surveys are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those described in &sect;488.305. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Four commenters asked for a clearer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of repeated noncompliance. Two commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicated that repeat noncompliance should be defined as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actual repeats of the same problem and the content of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiency and not just a repeat of a deficiency at the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tag number. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Sections 1819(h)(2)(E) and 1919(h)(2)(D) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act clearly indicate that action must be taken when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repeat noncompliance in the form of substandard quality of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
care is identified. The Act does not narrow the scope to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specify that the basis for finding substandard quality of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
care in a facility must be identical from one standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey to the next or for all three of the consecutive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard surveys considered in making the determination that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repeated substandard quality of care has occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, we do not believe that the regulation should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more narrowly define what constitutes substandard quality of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
care for the purpose of this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulation is being modified to clarify that action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be taken any time any deficiencies which constitute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substandard quality of care are identified in the last three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consecutive standard surveys. This provision will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applied solely on the basis of the repeated finding of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substandard quality of care, and no attempt will be made to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine whether the substance of the noncompliance or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exact tag numbers for deficiencies which constitute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance were repeated.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter stated that a facility's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance on surveys which were conducted prior to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective date of this regulation should be counted in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination of whether there is repeated noncompliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We agree with this comment. The survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process specified in the OBRA '87 provisions was effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for all surveys conducted on or after October 1, 1990. Even 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
though the implementation of the corresponding enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions was not concurrent, any standard survey completed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on or after October 1, 1990 must be considered in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination of whether there is repeated noncompliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that resulted in substandard quality of care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter suggested that to be consistent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the intent of the Act to have facilities maintain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance, regulations should require that facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintain compliance with the deficient requirement after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correction. The commenter recommended requiring termination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if a facility corrects the deficiency, but then falls out of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with the same requirement during the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correction period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Act provides that when a facility has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
had findings of substandard quality of care on three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consecutive standard surveys, the Secretary or the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must impose a denial of payment and a State monitor. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, sections 1819(h)(2)(E) and 1919(h)(2)(D) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act require that the denial of payment for new admissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and State monitor remedies must remain in force until the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility not only achieves substantial compliance but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrates that it can maintain substantial compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As we have explained earlier, substantial compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constitutes compliance for the purpose of imposing or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lifting a remedy, as well as issuing a certification of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We do not foresee the situation described by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter as a problem. If a facility has corrected a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiency, or is at least considered to be in substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance, any remedy(ies) in effect would be lifted as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
well as compliance certified. We would not normally revisit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a facility after compliance has been certified unless there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is a complaint or some other impetus. If, at some later 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date after compliance has been certified, the facility is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found to have a recurrence of the same deficiency that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
causes the facility to be out of substantial compliance, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either a new continuation of payment period would begin, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
termination (or cessation of FFP payments) would occur, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
depending on the seriousness of the noncompliance. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any termination would be based on the fact that the facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was not in substantial compliance with sections 1819 (b), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c), and (d) and 1919 (b), (c), and (d) of the Act by the end 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the correction period, and not on the fact that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance was repeated. We have not adopted the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter's suggestion to terminate a facility solely on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis of repeated noncompliance.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter asked that we clarify the term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``disciplinary action'' and state that the temporary manager 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must not have been found guilty of misconduct by any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensing board or professional society, and another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter recommended that HCFA maintain a national registry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of nursing home administrator disciplinary actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 To avoid confusion surrounding the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interpretation of ``disciplinary action,'' we will not use the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
term in the requirement at &sect;488.415(b)(2) as we did in

must ``not have been found guilty of misconduct by any

 Many commenters recommended that we include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements that the temporary manager must have had no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse ties to the problem facility, and must not have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fired from the facility in the past. Another commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed that we include a requirement that the temporary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manager have had no business or professional relationship 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the facility for a minimum of 3 years prior to his or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
her appointment to operate the facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We agree with the commenters that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual chosen to be temporary manager must not have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recently employed by the facility to be managed. We believe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that an individual's previous employment relationship with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility could positively or negatively prejudice that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual in his or her present dealings with the facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, we are incorporating into the regulation, at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.415(b)(4), a requirement that the temporary manager 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must not currently serve, or, within the past 2 years, have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
served as a member of the staff of the noncompliant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility. This requirement is similar to the requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for surveyors, which we believe is appropriate, since 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective evaluation is a necessary tool of both surveyors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and temporary managers and requires their objectivity.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter asked how prior competency will be judged. Various commenters suggested that prior competency be defined
by a minimum of one year of continuous experience as administrator of a long term care facility, by demonstrated expertise
and experience in the operation of a nursing facility similar to the one the temporary manager is needed to manage,
or by demonstrated experience in temporary management. Another commenter suggested that a measure of competency
be whether the temporary manager served within the past 10 years as the administrator of a facility which furnished
substandard quality of care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As explained below, we are no longer requiring that the temporary manager be a licensed nursing home administrator
or demonstrate prior competency as one. Because the skills and experience a temporary manager must have to correct
deficiencies will vary on a case by case basis, HCFA and the State need to have the flexibility to appoint whoever is
most suitable without the constraints of overly prescriptive eligibility requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When it happens that an individual interested in becoming a temporary manager is or has been a nursing home administrator,
the compliance histories of the facilities managed by him or her will be reviewed. We will provide in manual instructions
that there be such a review because we agree with the commenter that it would be inappropriate to appoint as a temporary
manager an administrator who has had difficulty maintaining facility compliance in the past.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commenters believed that the temporary manager should not be a current competitor of the facility, have
ownership interest in a competitor, or have been recently employed by a competitor. Commenters were concerned that
these individuals would gain an unfair competitive advantage if appointed temporary manager. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We appreciate this concern, and we and the State will attempt to select temporary managers who are not affiliated with
competitors of the facilities to be managed when the pool of temporary manager candidates allows. However, the purpose
of imposing temporary management or any other remedy is to achieve and maintain substantial compliance with Federal
requirements. When the only temporary manager candidate likely to accomplish this goal is affiliated with a competitor
of the problem facility, HCFA and the State will necessarily consider that affiliation to be subordinate to the administrator's
competency. If the facility feels more threatened by compromised competitiveness than it does by termination of
its provider agreement, it has the right to refuse to relinquish control to the temporary manager selected by HCFA
or the State, and subject itself to the possibility of termination instead.

One commenter was concerned that persons interested in acquiring a financial interest in a facility would be motivated
to serve as that facility's temporary manager in order to gain a competitive edge in later negotiations. The commenter
asked that we prevent this possibility by precluding through contract with the temporary manager the purchase or
other acquisition of the facility for a fixed period of time after completion of the temporary manager's responsibilities.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We do not have the authority to restrict a temporary manager's future business activities. If the facility to be managed
has reason to believe that the temporary manager chosen by HCFA or the State would use the financial information he
or she would acquire in the facility to the facility's disadvantage, the facility may raise this concern to HCFA or
the State, and HCFA or the State may attempt to locate a temporary manager that is more acceptable to the facility. Should
a temporary manager acceptable to the facility not be located, the facility may exercise its right to refuse to relinquish
control to the temporary manager and face termination of its provider agreement.

with an employee of HCFA, the Department of Health and Human Services, or any State licensing or survey agency.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We do not believe that a past affiliation with the aforementioned organizations would reduce a temporary manager's
objectivity or effectiveness in any way. On the contrary, it is likely that the temporary manager would be more knowledgeable
about Medicare and Medicaid participation requirements after having had exposure to the agencies that set and enforce
the Medicare and Medicaid requirements, and we expect that the facility at which the temporary manager is imposed
would benefit from this knowledge.

A couple of commenters believed that the State must compile and update a list of people or organizations that meet the
qualifications of temporary manager, and they asked that this list be available for public inspection. Another commenter
proposed that the State or HCFA maintain a list of substantiated complaints or allegations concerning the performance
of temporary managers.

We will not require that States catalogue complaints made against temporary managers, but will allow them to process
complaint information in the way that they determine is most effective. Neither will we require the States to compile,
update, and release a list of those qualified to be temporary managers. Because we have no authority to require the
release of individuals' qualifications or other assignments, a list of temporary managers would contain no criteria
by which facilities would be able to evaluate the candidates, and would be of little value. Moreover, HCFA and the State
are not obligated to seek facility approval of temporary managers. It is neither the facility's responsibility nor
right to select a temporary manager. (See additional response below.)

A few commenters recommended that we allow a State or a team of people to qualify as a temporary manager. They believed
that nursing guidance and expertise would be needed in addition to administrative supervision in order to remedy
serious deficiencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because a temporary manager has the authority to hire additional staff, it is possible for him or her to assemble what
would be in essence a temporary management team. When the temporary manager determines that successful correction
of a facility's deficiencies requires knowledge and skills in addition to his or her own, he or she may engage the specialists
necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have no statutory authority to require State survey agencies to make their staff available to function as temporary
managers. Their role involves survey, certification, and monitoring, rather than the management (albeit temporary)
of nursing homes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters asked that facilities be able to participate in the selection of the temporary manager. One recommended
that the governing board of the facility be responsible for placing the temporary manager at the facility, and others
requested that facilities be able to object to a particular temporary manager once selected by HCFA or the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The choice of a temporary manager will be made either by the State or by HCFA and will be based on the recommendation of
the State survey agency. The State survey agency's geographic proximity to the providers it surveys and its knowledge
of available and competent managers in the area place it in the best position to recommend a temporary manager. Because
facilities have the right to refuse to relinquish control to the temporary manager, no facility will be forced to submit
to a temporary manager that it objects to, and it may decide to subject itself to the possibility of termination instead.

Certain commenters were concerned that the qualifications for a temporary manager will be hard to meet. A few commenters
suggested that HCFA and the State be given latitude to appoint as temporary manager any qualified person, such as a
registered nurse with nursing home experience, instead of having to appoint a licensed nursing home administrator.

We agree that a nursing home administrator's license is not the only valid indicator of an individual's fitness to
serve as temporary manager. Certain combinations of educational and vocational achievement may also signify administrative
competency. We are, therefore, amending paragraph (b)(1) and deleting paragraph (b)(2) of &sect;488.215 as they
appeared in the proposed rule to allow an individual who does not hold a nursing home administrator's license to serve
as temporary manager if the State determines that he or she is qualified to oversee correction of deficiencies on the
basis of experience and education. Because this change should expand the pool of qualified temporary manager candidates,
it should reduce the number of terminations caused by inability to locate a temporary manager, a clear benefit to both
providers and residents.

 We agree that a temporary manager would not

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Many commenters requested that we impose an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforceable limit on the salary of the temporary manager, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and a large number of those recommended that we use the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevailing salary limit set forth in the preamble to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NPRM. Other commenters proposed that we require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compensation for the temporary manager to be set at a rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient to attract people with the necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualifications, and they recommended that we not limit the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
salary of the temporary manager to the rate mentioned in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preamble. These commenters were concerned that it would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unlikely to draw the expertise needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters requested that we identify who will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine the salary of the temporary manager, and certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of those asked whether it will be negotiable. Another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter asked if the facility will be obligated to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefits to the temporary manager. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 After reviewing the comments we received, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we have concluded that the salary limit put forth in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preamble to the proposed rule would not be in the best 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interests of facilities or their residents because it would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make it difficult to attract qualified temporary managers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The temporary managers that are available are sometimes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
located long distances from the facilities which need them, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and unless the salary offered is sufficiently attractive, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not induce individuals to temporarily upset their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
normal routines and accept the challenge of managing a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
severely deficient facility. If temporary managers cannot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be secured, we will have no choice but to proceed with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
termination. In order to avoid this result and promote the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of temporary management as an alternative remedy, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will give facilities the flexibility to exceed the salary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
floor specified below if the State is otherwise unable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attract a qualified temporary manager and the facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considers a higher payment preferable to termination. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
salary of the temporary manager must be at least equivalent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the prevailing salary paid by providers in the facility's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
geographic area for positions of this type, plus the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevailing cost of certain additional allowances. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional allowances will include costs that would have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonably been incurred by the provider if the temporary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manager had been in an employment relationship, such as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost of a benefits package, prorated for the amount of time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the temporary manager is working in the facility. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility will also be responsible for any other costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incurred by the temporary manager in furnishing services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under such an arrangement or as otherwise set by the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the State is in a better position than HCFA to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine the prevailing salary and other employment related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs of a nursing home administrator within what the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considers to be the facility's geographic area, it will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsible for setting the salary/benefits floor of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temporary manager and for determining whether or not it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to exceed it. The State may consult with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provider while it determines the appropriate salary, but we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not require that the salary of the temporary manager be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negotiable.

 We are considering requiring that facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pay the salary of the temporary manager before the remedy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
begins, which would eliminate the need for a recoupment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strategy. Until a decision is made, the mechanism that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently used to recover Medicare and Medicaid funds from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities which have been overpaid will be used to collect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
money from any facilities that owe the salary of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temporary manager. The amount owed would be withheld from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
future amounts due to the facility from HCFA or the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because Medicare and Medicaid payments may continue for up 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to 30 days after termination, salaries may be recouped even 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when they are owed by terminated facilities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A large number of commenters disagreed with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the provision that the temporary manager's salary be paid by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the facility. A few commenters stated that the money spent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on temporary management would be better spent by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility on its own improvements. Certain commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complained that a lack of sufficient funds is often what 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leads to noncompliance, and so they were concerned that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedy would be worthless without additional funding. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of commenters argued that a facility's inability to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pay for temporary management should not preclude its use as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a remedy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters recommended that the temporary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manager's salary be paid out of a fund composed of civil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
money penalties collected by the State, and certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters cited 42 U.S.C. 1396r(h)(2)(A)(ii) (section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1919(h)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act) as establishing the authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to do so. Other commenters believed that States should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to use funds collected through imposition of civil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
money penalties to cover the costs of correcting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies incurred by the temporary manager, but only if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the facility cannot afford to pay these costs itself. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certain commenters believed that the facility and its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators should be liable to the fund for reimbursement of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenses. One commenter recommended that the States should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be authorized to impose liens on the facility and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assets of the corporate entity until the facility reimburses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fund. Another commenter believed that the States should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be charged with the duty of using all available collection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods afforded by law to recoup expenditures from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fund. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter noted that 42 U.S.C. 1396r(h)(2)(E) (section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1919(h)(2)(e) of the Act) provides that temporary management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs are legitimately payable administrative expenses of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State. Therefore, this commenter and others believed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the temporary manager's salary and the costs that he or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
she incurs while managing the facility should be borne by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State and reimbursed under the State's Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reimbursement system.

to bear the cost of temporary management, and several asked 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that we state that the cost of temporary management is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an allowable expense for Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter recommended that the salary payment be funded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the facility but routed to the State which would deliver 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the payment to the temporary manager. The commenter was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerned that direct facility payment would undermine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
objectivity of the temporary manager. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We will continue to require that facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pay the salary of the temporary manager, and we will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deem this cost to be an allowable expense for Medicare or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid reimbursement. We believe that to do otherwise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would undermine our enforcement efforts to motivate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrective action and encourage sustained substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance. If we relieved facilities of their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility for bearing the costs of correcting serious 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies, we would be providing them with a clear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disincentive to remain in substantial compliance. We also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe that providing the services of a temporary manager 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without charging for them would be an inappropriate response 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to a facility's failure to meet the responsibility it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumed upon entering the Medicare and/or Medicaid programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to meet participation requirements. A noncompliant facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be held accountable for breaches of responsibility; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore, it (and not HCFA or the State) should bear the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost of the temporary management it has incurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because responsibility for paying for the cost of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temporary management is one condition of the remedy, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility's unwillingness to pay will be considered a failure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to relinquish control to the temporary manager, and will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cause the facility to be subject to the possibility of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
termination instead. A facility's inability to pay for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost of the temporary management will have the same result. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A provision has been added at paragraph (c)(4) to indicate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this. The conspicuous absence of consideration of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility's financial condition as a statutory criterion for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposing temporary management (as opposed to its inclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a criterion for determining the amount of a civil money 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty) implies that the Congress did not intend for it to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be a factor in imposition of the remedy. Consequently, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are also compelled to proceed with action to terminate those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities that are unable to assume the cost of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temporary management. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We do not believe that our position conflicts with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statutory references cited by certain commenters. Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1919(h)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act states that funds collected by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a State as a result of imposition of civil money penalties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be applied to the protection of the health or property 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of residents of nursing facilities that the State or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary finds deficient, including maintenance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation of a facility pending correction of deficiencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or closure. A temporary manager does not maintain operation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a facility. Rather, it is the facility ownership that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsible for sustaining facility operations. If the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State assumes control of a facility after it has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
abandoned by its ownership, then it would be appropriate for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State to use civil money penalty funds to pay the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenses of maintaining the abandoned facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also believe that commenters misinterpreted the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision of the Act found at section 1919(h)(2)(E). This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section states that the reasonable expenditures of a State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to provide for temporary management shall be considered for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal payment purposes to be necessary for the proper and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficient administration of the State plan. We believe this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refers to the resources necessary to locate, orient, guide, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and monitor the temporary manager, and does not include the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost of the temporary manager's service itself. When a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility pays for the temporary manager, we believe that it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be unnecessarily circuitous to route the salary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment to the State before delivering it to the temporary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manager, and disagree that direct payment would compromise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the temporary manager's objectivity. A facility would not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be able to use the temporary manager's salary as leverage to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
influence his or her actions because a facility could not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectively keep the salary from the temporary manager. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temporary manager would be paid even if the facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attempted to withhold his or her salary because HCFA or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State could recoup the amount owed to the temporary manager 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from payments later made to the facility. Therefore, we are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requiring that the facility pay the salary of the temporary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manager directly, and are modifying the provision at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.415(c) to reflect this.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters proposed various ways for HCFA and the State to obviate facility consent when appointing a temporary manager.
One suggestion was that we appoint the temporary manager subject to court order. Another recommendation was that
we administratively appoint the temporary manager in accordance with the State's police power. Additional commenters
proposed that we set limits on the duration of the temporary management (for example, restricting the appointment
to two weeks), the circumstances under which the manager would be appointed, and the funds that the manager could spend
in order to make the administrative appointment binding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters proposed not only that facilities be required to accept temporary management, but that HCFA and
the State be required to impose temporary management in immediate jeopardy situations without a choice between it
and termination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree that facilities should not be offered a formal choice of whether to accept or reject temporary management
because we believe that more facilities will exercise the right to refuse if it is explicitly offered. Therefore,
once HCFA or the State has determined that temporary management is the optimal enforcement response, we will expect
the facility to accept it, and we will proceed with the appointment of the temporary manager without requesting facility
consent to do so. However, facilities will have the right to refuse to relinquish control to the temporary manager
since the administrative process precludes us from forcing providers to relinquish control. A facility's refusal
will initiate termination. While we realize that, in effect, the right of refusing to relinquish control to the temporary
manager is tantamount to the prerogative of rejecting temporary management, we believe that the new arrangement
will encourage the use of the remedy. We are amending &sect;&sect;488.410, 488.415, and &sect;488.456 to delete
references to a facility's choice of accepting or rejecting the remedy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We cannot force a facility to relinquish control to a temporary manager because, ultimately, participation in the
Medicare or Medicaid program is voluntary under the Act, and we have no authority to compel a facility to stay in the
program should it, for its own reasons, choose to withdraw. We will not seek judicial action to impose temporary management
because the Act does not require that judicial intervention be a prerequisite for imposing this remedy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We do not believe it is appropriate to rest appointment of temporary managers upon the State's police power as described
in State law. First, the Act does not suggest that this be the case. Second, this remedy is one imposed under the Act,
not State law. Ultimate authority for this remedy lies, accordingly, in the Medicare and Medicaid laws and ought not
look to State law without some indication by the Congress that it expected this to be the case.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A facility's refusal to relinquish control to the temporary manager will cause HCFA or the State to proceed with action
to terminate the facility's program participation. We share commenter concern about the protection of the health
and safety of residents when termination proceedings have been initiated. Consequently, we will allow a State monitor
to be imposed at all facilities that have failed to relinquish control to a temporary manager in cases of immediate
jeopardy, and also at those facilities for which no temporary manager could be located. The monitor will notify HCFA
or the State when the absence of temporary management subjects residents to substantial risks, and HCFA and the State
may then opt to take additional enforcement action.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We note that the Act does not require that temporary management be imposed when there is immediate jeopardy. Sections
1819(h)(2)(A)(i), 1919(h)(1)(A), and 1919(h)(5) of the Act give HCFA and the State the option of using temporary
management and/or termination to respond to a situation that immediately jeopardizes the health or safety of residents.
In certain cases, facility shortcomings may be so severe and the likelihood of a temporary manager being able to successfully
remove them so small, that HCFA or the State may decide that resident interests would be better served by terminating
the facility and relocating the residents than by continuing to subject the residents to substandard conditions
that are unlikely to improve. Because we believe there are situations where termination is more appropriate than
temporary management, we do not accept the suggestion that HCFA and the State be required to impose a temporary manager
in lieu of termination in cases of immediate jeopardy.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Numerous commenters requested that we restructure the relationship between the facility and the temporary manager.
Certain commenters believed that the temporary manager should act in a consultant capacity, and not as a replacement
for the facility administrator. Others felt that the temporary manager should work under the control of the facility's
governing body, and that we should require the temporary manager to consult with the governing body when developing
the plan of correction. Another commenter favored giving the temporary manager legal but not financial control of
the facility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many other limitations on the temporary manager's authority were proposed. A number of commenters believed that
the temporary manager should not be able to make employment decisions, and they recommended that we require the temporary
manager to obtain approval from HCFA, the State, or the facility's governing body before hiring or firing facility
employees. Other commenters proposed that there be limits on the expenditures the temporary manager can make in order
to correct deficiencies, and they suggested that the regulation require that the temporary manager obtain the consent
of the provider to spend beyond those limits. Another group of commenters requested that we limit the time period for
which the temporary manager may legally commit or obligate the facility, and asked that we require the temporary manager
to seek facility approval before entering into long term contracts. A few commenters recommended that facility ownership
be able to appeal to the State to stay the actions of the temporary manager, and another requested that the facility
have the right to object to the temporary manager's business practices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 1819(h)(2)(B)(iii) and 1919(h)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act specifically provide that the temporary manager
is to oversee the operation of the facility and assure the health and safety of the facility's residents while improvements
are made to bring the facility into compliance. Further, once the facility relinquishes authority to the temporary
manager, the Act prohibits the removal of the temporary manager until the Secretary or the State has determined that
the facility has the management capability to ensure continued compliance, assuming that the Secretary or State
does not decide to terminate the facility before that time. We believe that implicit in the reason that the Act authorizes
temporary management is the assumption that the facility's management staff lacks the capability to bring the facility
into compliance. Therefore, the temporary manager needs to have the authority to completely manage the entire facility
with enough autonomy to remove any immediate jeopardy and/or correct deficiencies. Imposing the limits proposed
by commenters would handicap the ability of the temporary manager to make the necessary corrections, and thus jeopardize
the successful completion of the temporary manager's mission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe that requiring that the governing body of the facility be allowed to become involved in the decision making
process after it has demonstrated that its management skills are deficient would defeat the purpose of the remedy.
The temporary manager may find it useful to consult with facility officials, but the extent to which the temporary
manager interacts with the facility's management is at his or her discretion. This does not mean that we will deny the
facility the opportunity to object to the actions of the temporary manager, or that we will force the facility to submit
to the temporary manager's reform agenda against its will. At any time the governing body of the facility is not in agreement
with the decisions or actions of the temporary manager, it may advise the owner or corporate official with appropriate
authority to refuse to continue with the remedy. Such action would, of course, subject the facility to the possibility
of termination instead.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Many commenters believed that facilities should have recourse to HCFA or the State to express concerns regarding
the administrative competency of the temporary manager. One commenter was worried that providers would not have
the opportunity to lodge a complaint about the temporary manager before his or her services ended.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certain commenters proposed that HCFA and the State monitor the performance of the temporary manager and replace
any manager whose performance is unsatisfactory. Another commenter asked that a provider be able to replace the temporary
manager if the provider can demonstrate that the manager is incapable of correcting deficiencies or is jeopardizing
or impairing the facility's continued operation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 HCFA and the State survey agency will monitor the actions of the temporary manager, and we expect the facility to do
the same. We encourage an open dialogue with providers and invite them to communicate to HCFA or the State on an ongoing
basis any concerns that they have with the decisions of the temporary manager. If HCFA or the State is dissatisfied
with the performance of the temporary manager, we may respond by providing the temporary manager with remedial guidance
or by replacing him or her with an alternate. However, if these actions are not possible or prove unsuccessful, we will
have no choice but to remove the temporary manager and proceed with termination of the facility's provider agreement.
The most appropriate and practical response will vary, and it will depend upon factors such as the availability of
an alternate or the amount of time remaining in the 23 days after the last day of the survey allotted for removal of the
immediate jeopardy when the temporary manager is imposed in an immediate jeopardy situation.

 A temporary manager's failure to correct facility deficiencies does not absolve a facility of its responsibility
for generating corrections to those deficiencies, and if deficiencies are not corrected or the immediate jeopardy
is not removed timely, the facility will be terminated. HCFA and the State are not required to provide facilities with
additional time to come back into substantial compliance, but we are obligated to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries
and Medicaid recipients receive the quality care to which they are entitled.

 Many commenters requested that we clarify the fiduciary responsibility of the temporary manager. One commenter
asked that we designate the temporary manager as a fiduciary of the facility, and stated that by doing so we would empower
the facility to protect its interests through established legal principles governing the relationship of fiduciaries
to their charges. Other commenters believed we should stipulate that the temporary manager has a responsibility
to maintain confidentiality of facility information, and obligations to act in the facility's best interests and
ensure that the facility's financial resources are properly managed while he or she works to bring the facility into
compliance. Additional commenters asked that we require the temporary manager to conduct himself or herself in a
professional manner and to act in a manner reasonably calculated to correct deficiencies and protect the facility's
residents.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The temporary manager has a responsibility to further the enforcement efforts of HCFA or the State in an effort to protect
the facility's residents, and not a duty to serve the facility. HCFA or the State commissions the temporary manager
to correct deficiencies identified in the facility's operation, and we expect the temporary manager to exercise
sound financial judgment and discretion while executing his or her duty. Likewise, we assume that the temporary manager
will conduct himself or herself in a professional manner and act in the facility's best interests. However, we will
not explicitly require these standards in the regulation. These terms could not be meaningfully defined because
appropriate definitions for them would vary with the circumstances of each temporary management assignment.

 A great number of commenters asked that the temporary manager be held liable to the owner or governing body of a facility
for gross negligence, intentional acts and omissions, unexplained shortfalls in facility funds, and breaches of
fiduciary duty. Certain commenters proposed that HCFA, the State, or the temporary manager be required to secure
a bond before overseeing operation of a facility, and others requested that HCFA or the State indemnify the facility
for harmful consequences arising from the temporary manager's actions or omissions. Another felt that HCFA or the
State should be identified as the temporary manager's employer for liability purposes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We expect facilities to monitor the performance of the temporary manager, and if they have any apprehensions about
his or her performance, they may have the remedy discontinued. Neither HCFA nor the State can force a facility to relinquish
control to the temporary manager. Because it is the facility that decides to continue to yield to the temporary manager,
neither HCFA nor the State will assume liability for the facility's decision. However, the facility does have the
right to seek from the temporary manager any redress available under State laws relating to liability and fiduciary
responsibilities.

 All of the actions needed to remove immediate jeopardy and correct deficiencies at a facility may not be readily apparent
at the outset of the temporary management; therefore, it would be imprudent to delineate the specific duties and authorities
of the temporary manager in contract form. The temporary manager must have the autonomy to take whatever steps are
necessary to bring the facility into substantial compliance and ensure resident health and safety. Shortsighted
contract provisions could prove restrictive and thus impede the temporary manager's progress.

 It would be more appropriate for a facility's insurer to address this issue. Should a facility find that the imposition
of a temporary manager will cause the cost of its liability insurance to rise, this increase would be one of the factors
that the facility would have to consider when evaluating the benefits and costs of relinquishing control to a temporary
manager.

 The temporary manager does not have the authority to selectively meet the financial obligations of the nursing home.
That is, the temporary manager can not choose to pay some bills and not others, because he or she disagrees with the wisdom
of the permanent facility management having assumed those financial obligations previously. It is the temporary
manager's role to manage all aspects of the facility's operation, including its finances.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not be in other facilities. We expect the temporary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manager to work within any limitations under which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility operates and to abide by union agreements and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contracts. (See above response.)

One commenter asked whether HCFA or the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would sanction a temporary manager who fails to rectify an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediate jeopardy situation within 23 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A failure to rectify an immediate jeopardy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situation may be more indicative of the magnitude of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility's deficiencies than the competency of the temporary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manager, and neither HCFA nor the State will penalize 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
automatically a temporary manager when his or her efforts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failed to remove the immediate jeopardy. However, if HCFA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or the State believes that the temporary manager was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficient in his or her duty, then that individual may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalized to the extent that he or she is excluded from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration for future temporary management assignments.

Several commenters asked that we limit the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
duration of the temporary management. Many recommended that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the temporary manager be discontinued when the immediate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jeopardy is removed or when compliance with the requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that triggered the temporary management is achieved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Temporary management will be removed when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the facility is terminated, or when HCFA or the State has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that the facility is in substantial compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and has the management capability to sustain substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance. The temporary management might end when the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediate jeopardy has been removed and deficiencies have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been corrected, but it would not have to. It would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
premature to discontinue the temporary management before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA or the State is confident that the facility will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relapse into noncompliance. Effective enforcement involves 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promoting sustained substantial compliance, and we are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revising &sect;488.454, ``Duration of remedies'' to reflect this.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter recommended that HCFA or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State be able to continue special actions taken by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temporary manager which are necessary to protect resident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health, welfare or safety. Facility management would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request termination of the special conditions once it could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
show that they are no longer necessary. The commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believed that this policy would ensure that the facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
doesn't deteriorate when the temporary management ends. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Neither HCFA nor the State will discontinue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temporary management and restore control of a facility to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its own management unless it is convinced that the facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is capable of and committed to sustaining substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance. We do not believe an additional regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision is necessary to ensure this result.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters were opposed to the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temporary management, and proposed alternatives to it. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter suggested that, instead of using temporary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management in immediate jeopardy cases, HCFA require the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-compliant homes to hire consultants approved by HCFA to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correct deficiencies. Another commenter proposed that HCFA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
itself create and train teams to act in an advisory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capacity. A few commenters asked that temporary management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be eliminated and replaced by State monitoring. Another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter requested that we allow facilities to devise their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
own plans of correction to remove immediate jeopardy and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have the State agency monitor implementation instead of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposing temporary management. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Temporary management is authorized by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sections 1819(h)(2)(B)(iii), 1919(h)(2)(A)(iii), and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1919(h)(3)(C)(iii) of the Act, and HCFA and the States are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to establish and implement it: we may not exclude 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it as an enforcement option. Sections 1819(h)(2)(A)(i), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1919(h)(1)(A), and 1919(h)(5) of the Act specifically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require that temporary management be used in immediate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jeopardy situations when provider agreement termination is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not sought. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that the temporary manager is to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oversee the operation of a facility and assure the health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and safety of the facility's residents while improvements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are made to bring the facility into compliance. Therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we conclude that the Act intends the temporary manager's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
role to be more than that of just a monitor of the progress 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made by the facility or a consultant to management, and we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe that inherent in the Act's rationale for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishing temporary management is the assumption that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility's management staff lacks the capability to bring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the facility into compliance. It would be insufficient to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substitute the use of a consultant or monitor for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appointment of a temporary manager, because a consultant or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitor would not have the authority to completely manage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the entire facility as a temporary manager does. Only a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temporary manager has a role active enough to substitute for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the facility management, whose deficient skills or practices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would impede correction of deficiencies and protection of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the residents' health or safety.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter wondered how availability of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temporary managers would affect the use of this remedy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In cases of immediate jeopardy, if a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temporary manager cannot be located within 10 days of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
last day of the survey, HCFA or the State is required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proceed with action to terminate the facility's program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation in order to protect the health or safety of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the residents. To safeguard residents when this takes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
place, we will allow a State monitor to be imposed who will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notify HCFA or the State if residents are being subjected to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial risks and need to be transferred from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility. If a temporary manager cannot be located for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situation which does not immediately jeopardize the health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or safety of the residents, HCFA or the State has the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flexibility to impose another type of remedy which it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes will best motivate the facility to achieve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial compliance. However, if temporary management is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the most logical alternative remedy, and a temporary manager 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cannot be located, HCFA or the State has the authority to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminate the provider agreement. We do not believe that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the imposition of temporary management in lieu of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
termination is a provider right. Rather, it is an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accommodation to the provider if, in the judgment of HCFA or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State, it will lead to substantial compliance and there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are competent temporary managers available in the given 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
geographic area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few commenters requested that States be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
able to appoint a trustee or a receiver in lieu of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temporary manager if they have State laws that provide for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these enforcement actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many States have developed laws in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with State licensure authority that provide for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanctions similar to temporary management. The States use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these sanctions, such as receivership and trusteeship, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforce compliance with State licensure requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1919(h)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act also gives the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the authority to use these measures when enforcing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with Federal Medicaid participation requirements, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if the State can demonstrate to HCFA's satisfaction through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a State plan amendment that trusteeship or receivership is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as effective in deterring noncompliance and correcting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies as the remedy of temporary management. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, if HCFA approves the State plan amendment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishing trusteeship or receivership as a remedy, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trustee or receiver may be used by a State as an acceptable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative to a temporary manager when the State takes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcement action. The State may use the alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedy both when a temporary manager is required in cases of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediate jeopardy, and when one is selected as the most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate enforcement response in non-jeopardy cases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter asked that we state the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions under which temporary management will be imposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Other than the provisions in the law 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requiring temporary management in situations that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediately jeopardize the health or safety of residents, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific criteria for imposing temporary management in other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
types of situations would be impossible to develop. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision of HCFA or the State to impose a temporary manager 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be based on the deficiencies found at the time of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey coupled with other factors that exist at the facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at that particular point in time. For example, a facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
might identify a deficiency before the State survey agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does and attempt to correct it. Although we could not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dismiss the facility's failure to prevent the deficiency, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neither would we ignore the administrative competence that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the facility demonstrated by identifying and attempting to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
address the deficiency on its own initiative. We would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider both factors when selecting the appropriate remedy.

Section 488.417&blank;Denial of Payment for All New Admissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Upon our review of comments and evaluation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
underlying statute, we noted that we did not make it clear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the proposed rule that the authority of the Secretary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deny payment to a facility is limited to Medicare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities. In the case of Medicaid facilities, the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may deny payment to the facility and HCFA may deny payment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the State for all Medicaid residents in the facility. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
related issue is the question of who must be satisfied that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a facility has achieved and will remain in substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance after the facility has been cited for repeated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instances of substandard quality of care so that payments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may resume. Section 1819(h)(2)(E) says that it is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary for Medicare, and section 1919(h)(2)(D) says that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it is the State for Medicaid.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter said that this remedy should be

imposed only in cases posing a hazard to the residents or in

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We consider this remedy to be appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for both the cases in which we have designated it may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used and the cases in which we designate it must be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe that it will be one of our most effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies because it will strongly motivate facilities to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
come into and remain in compliance.

payment for certain diagnostic categories set forth at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.217(b) of the proposed rule would be ineffective, and

lead to discrimination against individuals whose care may be

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We believe that these arguments are

convincing, and to prevent facilities from using the

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Many commenters said that this remedy as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
written is too broad and subject to too much interpretation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particularly with respect to the meaning of the terms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``adequate care,'' ``diagnostic categories,'' ``certain specified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diagnoses,'' ``substandard quality of care,'' and ``new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
admission.'' Some said that residents who go to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospital, then directly back to the facility, should not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered to be ``new admissions.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ``Substandard quality of care'' has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined in &sect;488.301. ``New admission'' has been defined at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.401 and the definition already contained the statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that residents admitted before the effective date of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
denial of payment and taking temporary leave are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered new admissions, nor subject to the denial of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment. Since we have deleted the proposed &sect;488.417(b), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no definitions for those terms need be provided. Finally, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the term ``adequate care'' does not appear in the regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
text at &sect;488.417. When it appears elsewhere in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation, it has the ordinary dictionary meaning.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One facility offered criteria for imposing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
denial of payment for all new admissions based on a scope 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and severity scale of its own design, and suggested we say, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at &sect;488.417, that denial of payment for all new admissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be in effect only until the date the facility is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certified to be in substantial compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We received several suggestions for revising 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
our scope and severity scales, and the enforcement scheme 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that we have established at &sect;488.408 (``Selection of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies.'') reflects some of these suggestions. Neither a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
denial of payment nor any other remedy will be imposed at a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility in substantial compliance, as defined at &sect;488.401. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once a denial of payment is imposed, it will be lifted when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the facility achieves substantial compliance (and is capable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of maintaining it, if necessary). This policy is set forth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, as well as at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.454 Duration of remedies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter, in setting forth regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
text for proposed &sect;488.217, said that_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Denial of payment should be imposed, not only for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any deficiency which remains uncorrected within 90 calendar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
days after the last day of survey identifying the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiency, but for any deficiency which remains 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantially uncorrected within that time period as well; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If the facility can supply documentation that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial compliance was attained on a date preceding that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the revisit of the survey team, the denial of payment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only remains in effect until the date that substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance was actually reached; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Denial of payment for all new admissions should last 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only until the facility has ``substantially corrected'' the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Denial of payment should not take effect until either 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA or the State has provided notice to the facility and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the public of the impending action. Public notice shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided by publication in a newspaper of general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circulation in the county where the facility is located; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Another commenter agreed that denial of payment should not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
take effect until notice has been provided, and also said 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that HCFA should set forth regulations requiring States to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
give notice to facilities before denying payment for all new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
admissions.); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;When payments resume, this too should be announced to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the public in the same way as the denial notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We agree that denial of payment for all new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
admissions should last only until the facility is in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial compliance. Because the final rule reflects the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adoption of a substantial compliance standard, a denial of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment for new admissions, like other sanctions, will only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be applied should a facility fail to meet that standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, under sections 1819(h)(2)(d) or 1919(h)(2)(C) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act, that facility must face a denial of payments for new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
admissions. Similarly, if, within 3 months of the survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that first identified deficiencies, the facility is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
successful in achieving substantial compliance, the denial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of payments will be lifted as required by sections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1819(h)(3) and 1919(h)(4) of the Act. If the facility does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not come into substantial compliance by 3 months after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
last day of the survey, denial of payment will be imposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
until substantial compliance is achieved or until the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility is terminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also agree that, except in the case of the mandatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
denial of payment for substandard quality of care identified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in three consecutive standard surveys, if the facility can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supply documentation acceptable to HCFA or the State survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency that it was in substantial compliance, and was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capable of remaining in substantial compliance, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary, on a date preceding that of the revisit, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies terminate on the date that HCFA or the State can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verify as the date that substantial compliance was achieved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(This is further discussed in connection with a comment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.454.) In the case of repeated substandard quality of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
care, the Act requires that the denial of payment (and State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitor) remain in place until the facility is in compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and can demonstrate that it will remain in compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We agree that facilities should receive notice of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies before they are imposed. Notification requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are found at &sect;488.402(f), and need not appear again at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.417. The commenter cited section 1919(h)(2)(A)(i) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act as rationale for HCFA promulgating regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
setting forth procedures for States to use in informing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general public about remedies. We do not agree that the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires HCFA to promulgate regulations regarding how States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must go about notifying the general public.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Some commenters said that the remedy denial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of payment for specific categories of residents to be used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if the surveyor finds that the facility is not currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
able to provide adequate care for these individuals, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determines that caring for such individuals would adversely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affect care provided to other residents, was not one of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies provided in OBRA '87. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are deleting the provisions for denial of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment for specific categories of residents from this final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule because, as we stated at the beginning of this section, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we believe that this remedy could lead to inequities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A number of commenters expressed concern over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether survey agency revisits would be timely enough to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure the prompt resumption of payments as soon as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility corrects its deficiencies.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are revising this final rule to state 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that deficiencies are considered to be corrected when a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey team revisit confirms that they have been corrected, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or when a facility provides evidence satisfactory to HCFA or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State survey agency, which can be verified without an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on-site visit, that the deficiencies have been corrected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before the revisit or before the credible evidence was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted. In addition, sections 1819(h)(3) and 1919(h)(4) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Act allow for lifting the denial of payment for new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
admissions when the facility achieves substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance. (Please see the discussion regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial compliance under the comments pertaining to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.454 in this final rule, Duration of remedies.)

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two commenters suggested that, instead of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
denying payment for all new Medicare and/or Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
admissions when warranted, we impose a ban on all new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
admissions to a facility, regardless of the source of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment. They said that if we use this remedy, we should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pair it with a directed plan of correction requiring the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility to take steps to restore capacity to provide a full 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
range of NF/SNF services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We cannot accept this suggestion since the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act does not give us the authority to regulate payments that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be made to facilities by private paying residents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Three commenters suggested that we add to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed &sect;488.217 (a)(2) and (b)(2) a sentence stating, ``No 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retroactive payments will be made when a ban on all new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
admissions is lifted.'' The rationale is that, if facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
know they will receive payments later, they may admit those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residents they choose and thus cover the short term cash 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flow problem. They say that this would lessen the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectiveness of the sanction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We agree in principle, and, for purposes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clarification, we are revising the suggested sentence to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
state, at &sect;488.417(e), that no retroactive payments will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made for any new admissions to the facility for the period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between the date the remedy was imposed and the date that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA or the State determines that the facility achieved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial compliance.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter suggested that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.417(a)(1)(i) be revised to state that HCFA or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State may impose a denial of payment for new admissions if a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiency remains uncorrected after 90 calendar days (as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opposed to within) of the last day of survey identifying the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiency. As worded in the proposed rule, the mandatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanction would have been imposed if a deficiency had existed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at any time during the 90 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We agree with the intent of the comment, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
although we are no longer referring to 90 days but to 3 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
months as the Act does, we are making this revision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Please note that the proposed &sect;488.217(a)(1)(i) is now 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
redesignated as &sect;488.417(b)(1).)

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter suggested that HCFA deny payment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for all new admissions after the second consecutive survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which documents that substandard care is being provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rationale is that this would be more in keeping with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose of remedies, that is, encouraging rapid compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the program requirements. Another commenter suggested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that denial of payment for new admissions be a mandatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedy when there are widespread substandard quality of care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violations or when there is a pattern of substandard quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of care violations.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter said that provisions should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made for the protection of Medicare beneficiaries or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid recipients, or both, admitted to a facility while 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the payment ban on new admissions is in effect. To protect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such individuals, the commenter said, providers should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prohibited from seeking payment from residents or third 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parties for any care furnished during a period in which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providers were denied payment for new admissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This provision is already in the Act at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1866(a)(1)(A) for Medicare and at section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1919(c)(5)(A) for Medicaid. Additionally, 42 CFR 447.15 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obligates providers to accept Medicaid payments as payment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in full.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter said that, in order for this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedy to be effective, the duration must be such that there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is some assurance that compliance will be sustained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the strictest sense, regardless of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nature of the deficiency, and regardless of the remedy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposed, there can be no guarantee that substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance will continue once the survey team leaves. We 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can only impose reasonable sanctions and make periodic on-site inspections to ensure compliance. However, when
HCFA or the State denies payment for instances of repeated substandard quality of care, we do, at paragraph (c) of this
section, state that the sanction is not lifted until_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The facility is in substantial compliance; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;HCFA or the State survey agency believes that it will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remain in substantial compliance.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter suggested we amend this section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to state that a denial of payment for all new admissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will take effect on the date the facility receives the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice of the remedy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Notification requirements are at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.402(f). Section 488.402(f)(1) states that, except when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State is taking the action for a non-State operated NF, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA gives the provider notice of the reasons for, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective date of, the remedy. Paragraph (f)(2) states 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that, for all remedies specified in &sect;488.406, the notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be given at least 2 calendar days before the effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date of the remedy in immediate jeopardy situations, and at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least 15 calendar days before the effective date in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-immediate jeopardy situations. We believe that this is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equitable. Nursing homes are businesses, some of them very 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
large businesses. They have payrolls to meet, suppliers to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pay, buildings and equipment to maintain, and similar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overhead. An ``effective immediately'' notice would not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable.

 One commenter said that &sect;488.417(a)(1)(i) is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inconsistent with &sect;488.412(b)(3). Section 488.417 says, at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (a)(1), that HCFA or the State may deny payment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for new admissions, and, at (a)(1)(i), that HCFA will and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State must deny payment for new admissions if any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiency remains uncorrected within 90 calendar days after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the last day of survey identifying the deficiencies. (Since 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.412(b)(3) bears no direct relationship to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.417(a)(1)(i) and &sect;488.412(a)(3) does, we believe that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the commenter meant to cite the latter, which says that if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any deficiency remains uncorrected within 90 calendar days 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after the last day of survey, HCFA will and the State must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 While &sect;&sect;488.417(a)(1)(i) and 488.412(a)(3) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overlap, they are not inconsistent because a certain amount

of overlapping has been purposely written into this final

rule for ease of reference on the part of those who will use

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;They are unjustifiably severe; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Providers can not comply with them in all cases because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some deficiencies take more than 90 days to correct; and

(IoM), which is part of the National Academy of Sciences, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted a study of the policies and regulations governing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the certification of nursing homes participating in Medicare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Medicaid. Its report, issued in March 1986, cited the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
urgent need for enacting statutory provisions extending the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies available to HCFA and the States in enforcing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with nursing home regulations. A General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accounting Office (GAO) study (``Medicare and Medicaid: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Stronger Enforcement of Nursing Home Requirements Needed'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(July 1987)) also concluded that penalties short of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decertification of nursing homes are needed to deter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance. HCFA's operating experience also bears this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
out. Traditionally, if facilities were unable to correct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies within 90 days of the survey date, their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provider agreements would have been terminated by the 90th 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
day. We, along with the IoM, GAO, and the Congress believe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that these regulations are necessary, are not unduly harsh 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or severe, and that it is possible for providers to comply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with them. Furthermore, the denial of payment for new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
admissions is not only authorized by the Act, but required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the Act in certain circumstances, such as when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance remains after 3 months or when substandard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality of care has been cited in three consecutive standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveys.

Upon our review of comments and evaluation of the

underlying Act, we noted that we did not include a section

in the proposed rule explicitly stating the Secretary's

authority to deny all payment to a facility. Under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1819(h)(2)(B) of the Act, if a facility has not met a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement, the Secretary may deny payment for all Medicare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residents. Under section 1819(h)(2)(E), the Secretary is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to deny payment for all current Medicare residents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or for all Medicare new admissions if a SNF, on three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consecutive standard surveys has been found to have provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substandard quality of care.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 1919(h)(3)(C)(i) of the Act, the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may deny payments for all current Medicaid residents but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this denial authority is exercised against the State, not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the facility. Only with respect to State-operated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities may the Secretary take action directly against a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility because section 1919(h)(3)(A) expressly provides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are adding new &sect;488.418 to make explicit this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority. We provide that, if a facility has not met a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement, in addition to the authority to deny payment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for all new admissions as set forth at &sect;488.417(a), HCFA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has the authority to deny any further payment to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility for all Medicare residents and to deny further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment to the State for all Medicaid residents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under paragraph (b) of new &sect;488.418, if the facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieves substantial compliance, HCFA resumes payment to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility or the State prospectively from the date that it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verifies as the date that substantial compliance has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieved, except as provided in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If payments to the facility or the State resume, no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments will be made for the period between the date the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedy was imposed and the date that HCFA verifies as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date that substantial compliance was achieved. This is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
case with both denial of payment for all new admissions as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
well as with denial of payment for those already residing in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Should HCFA or the State find that the facility was in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial compliance before the date of the revisit, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before HCFA or the survey agency receives the credible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence of such compliance, the remedy must be lifted as of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the date that substantial compliance was achieved, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined by HCFA. The exceptions to this rule occur when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the denial of payment remedy is imposed for repeat instances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of substandard quality of care. The remedy is not lifted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
until substantial compliance is achieved and HCFA believes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the facility will remain in substantial compliance.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Act requires State monitoring in cases of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repeated noncompliance. That is, if a facility, on three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consecutive standard surveys conducted under sections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1819(g)(2) and 1919(g)(2) of the Act has been found to have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided substandard quality of care, State monitoring is to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be imposed. Otherwise, State monitoring may be considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as an optional remedy.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters raised questions as to how 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funding for State monitors would be met. Some suggested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that costs for monitoring be borne by the facility and not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be an allowable cost for reimbursement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We believe the costs of State monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be part of the survey and certification process and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore, should be considered by the State survey agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in planning its annual Medicare and Medicaid workload. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
budgeted amounts for these activities are approved by HCFA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as part of the annual survey and certification budget 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process.

 A few commenters suggested that we prescribe

the role of the State monitor in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

 We do not wish to prescribe the role of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State monitor; however, we have clarified language in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule describing in general terms the purpose of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State monitor. The State monitor oversees the correction of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cited deficiencies and ensures that residents are protected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from harm. Any more specific description of State monitor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
roles and responsibilities will be addressed in manual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Some commenters expressed concerns regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the length of time State monitoring would continue. Several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters suggested that the State survey agency retain the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ability to monitor ongoing conditions in the facility until 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State survey agency or HCFA determines the serious 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition(s) have been corrected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We agree with the commenters. State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring remains in place at least until HCFA or the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey agency determines that the provider is in substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with the requirements of participation. In the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
case of State monitoring imposed for repeated substandard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality of care, the sanction will stay in place until the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility has demonstrated to the Secretary or the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey agency that it will stay in substantial compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At this time, any serious deficiencies must have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrected to the point where the facility is in substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 Because of the broad spectrum of situations

expand the current language in &sect;488.422(a).

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Some commenters wanted us to define a directed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PoC as a facility-initiated PoC which the State or HCFA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
orders the facility to implement. Commenters reasoned that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
making this change would allow States to use directed PoC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more efficiently and effectively since facilities' governing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bodies will generally be more capable of drafting viable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plans of correction based upon knowledge of facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resources. One commenter wanted to amend proposed &sect;488.224 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to read as follows: ``HCFA, or the State (or the temporary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manager with HCFA or State approval) has the responsibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to develop a plan of correction *&blank;*&blank;*''. Another commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believed that when the State or HCFA orders (or directs) a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility to comply with the directed PoC, the State or HCFA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have more authority to require the facility to revise any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aspect of the PoC which is not acceptable. The commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further suggested that the imposition of a governmentally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
created PoC on a facility raises questions of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
government's and the facility's respective liabilities if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the plan does not correct the deficiencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Defining a directed PoC as a facility-initiated plan which HCFA or the State orders or directs a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility to implement would be virtually identical to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
way we have always defined a traditional PoC. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
traditional PoC is a requirement when any deficiency is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cited, except for isolated deficiencies where no actual harm 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has occurred and there may be potential for minimal harm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exception to this is if a directed PoC is used as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedy. The directed PoC can be used by itself for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies which cause no actual harm. We also disagree 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a PoC developed by the facility would give the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey agency or HCFA any more authority than one developed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the State survey agency, HCFA, or a temporary manager. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We do not believe that to say ``HCFA *&blank;*&blank;* has the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility'' adds anything to the meaning of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section. Although it may be true that the facility's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governing body may be more familiar with a facility's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resources, developing a directed PoC does not rest solely on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this knowledge. For the reasons stated above, we are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accepting these suggestions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the commenter's point that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governmentally-initiated PoC could raise a question about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State's or HCFA's liability if the directed PoC does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correct deficiencies, we do not guarantee that any remedy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will necessarily result in facility compliance. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directed PoC, as well as other remedies prescribed, are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developed and recommended based on the professional judgment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of State or HCFA staff and their consideration of which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedy(ies) would promote prompt achievement of compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a remedy does not result in a facility achieving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance, another remedy may be imposed to safeguard the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health or safety of nursing home residents. This other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedy could be an additional remedy from the same category, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or, if the deficiencies have been exacerbated, a remedy or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies from a higher category, including termination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, HCFA and the State will usually impose alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies prior to terminating a facility.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are rejecting this suggestion for several reasons. Mandating a directed PoC for certain deficiencies would limit
HCFA or the State's choice of remedies and would run counter to the thrust of the Act which encourages the flexible application
of enforcement options. Also, requiring a remedy for specific deficiencies would be inconsistent with the requirements
associated with other remedies. We also do not want to prescribe in regulations which staff people must develop the
directed PoC, but opt to give HCFA or State the flexibility to decide who will carry out this function. We expect that
the State survey agency would develop the directed PoC, but the State would be responsible for officially notifying
the facility of the remedy. However, in manual instructions, we will provide guidance in this regard by including
examples of deficiency situations and corresponding directed PoCs which are appropriate in terms of content and
the staff person responsible for development.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter urged HCFA to require that directed PoCs include specific corrective action to protect individual
residents who suffered harm when those residents are clearly identifiable. Another commenter wanted the rule amended
to provide that all PoCs are to make an injured resident or residents ``whole,'' whenever possible, and that the facility
be required to take specific steps to ensure future compliance. The commenters offered, as an example, a facility
which improperly denies a resident his or her bed hold rights. The commenters believed that in this example the directed
PoC must require that the facility honor the resident's statutory right to return to the next available bed. Commenters
feared that without such a requirement, the directed PoC will be nothing more than a facility's promise not to do it
again.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Requiring in regulation that a facility make a resident whole whenever a resident has been injured or has been deprived
of his or her rights would be virtually impossible. In many instances where irreparable harm has occurred this would
be an unattainable goal. Although HCFA and the State survey agency consider the unique circumstances of a facility
and the results on residents when developing a directed PoC, any PoC is based on prospective compliance. The principle
behind a PoC is to ensure that the underlying cause of cited deficiencies does not recur. The purpose of the PoC is not,
however, a checklist of past violations which must retroactively be corrected. In the example cited, if a facility
denied a resident a bed through improper application of a bed hold policy, the resident would probably have to be admitted
to another facility. Prescribing in the directed PoC that the resident would be eligible to be readmitted to the facility
when the next bed became available would be pointless since he or she, being unable to wait, would probably already
be placed in another home. We have not accepted this comment to mandate that the directed PoC include resident specific
reparations.

for repeat substandard quality of care findings at a scope of 1 or 2 and for all other repeated violations.

We are not accepting this suggestion. Based on numerous public comments, we have reconfigured the scope and severity
grid without numerical values, and are offering it in this preamble as one example of how a State could determine what
remedies to impose in noncompliant facilities. Additionally, we have developed recommended categories of remedies
for ranges of deficiencies. The directed PoC is a remedy which can be used for any deficiency and may be the only remedy
used for lower level deficiencies. We do not intend to require a directed PoC for substandard quality of care findings
but rather leave that option to the enforcing entity. Nor do we mandate the use of directed PoCs for repeat deficiencies.
The law provides for denial of payment, State monitoring, and increased civil money penalties in certain cases of
repeated noncompliance and those are the only enforcement actions related to repeat deficiencies that we have required
in these regulations.

Section 488.425&blank;Directed In-Service Training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On the basis of our review of issues raised by commenters and our reevaluation of our statutory authority, we are including
in the final rule a provision for the imposition of a directed inservice training program. After several years of experience
with implementing the OBRA '87 provisions, we have come to a greater realization that some compliance problems are
a result of imperfect knowledge on the part of the health services staff relative to state-of-art practices and resident
outcome expectations. For example, we know that incontinence and decubitus ulcers are not an inevitable result of
old age and immobility. The incidence and/or prevalence of these conditions in a particular long-term care facility
may be the result of general lack of knowledge about the prevention and treatment of these conditions, and a lasting
change may be produced in that facility by a directed inservice training program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also believe that a directed inservice training program may be particularly effective in reducing reliance on
chemical restraints. Two studies have been instructional on this point. The first, entitled ``A Randomized Trial
of a Program to Reduce the Use of Psychoactive Drugs in Nursing Homes'' by Dr. Jerry Avorn and colleagues (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
New England Journal of Medicine; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Vol. 327 No. 3; July 16, 1992, pages 168&hyph;173), demonstrates that a fairly intensive training program for the
medical, as well as, all three shifts of the nursing staff (including aides) can bring a dramatic reduction in the use
of psychoactive drugs without adversely affecting the overall behavior and level of functioning of the residents.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another study was entitled, ``Reducing Antipsychotic Drug Use in Nursing Homes: A Controlled Trial of Provider Education,''
by Dr. Wayne Ray and colleagues at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Archives of Internal Medicine; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Vol. 153; March 22, 1993, pages 713&hyph;721. This study applied a formalized training program to teach nursing personnel
how to manage the most prevalent behavioral symptoms experienced by aged individuals in nursing homes. Common behavioral
symptoms such as catastrophic reaction, yelling and screaming, fighting, wandering, etc. are addressed in this
study, and non-drug interventions are described. The training program led to a 59 percent reduction in the use of antipsychotic
drugs over the control facility, and a 31 percent reduction in physical restraints over the control facility.

We would invite facilities to use inservice programs conducted by sources with an in-depth knowledge of the area(s)
which require specific training so the positive change is achieved and maintained. We would also encourage facilities
to use programs developed by well established centers of geriatric health services education and training. These
centers include, but are not limited to, schools of medicine or nursing, Area Health Education Centers, and centers
for aging. These centers should have established programs in geriatrics and geriatric psychiatry. We only recommend
to the facility where it can obtain its inservice training program. The ultimate test of the training program will
be in the outcome of care achieved by the facility after completion of the training program. If the resident's care
circumstance has not improved after training, the facility, upon resurvey by the State agency, will be subject to
stronger sanctions. We also require that the payment for the directed inservice training is the responsibility of
the facility.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters said that HCFA should give more guidance on when closure of a facility and/or transfer of residents
are appropriate. Others were concerned because the regulations did not set out procedures for State transfer of residents.
A few commenters said that closures should be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the proposed &sect;488.240.
Some commenters insisted that closing a facility should only be a last resort when alternative methods have failed
or the physical plant is unsafe. Other commenters said HCFA should include a definition of the term ``emergency''
in the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The closure of a facility and/or transfer of the residents are measures of last resort that are taken only in an emergency
situation. These actions are rare, but most States have had experience with such actions. Most States have a relocation
plan that outlines the circumstances under which the plan will be put into effect and the procedures to be followed.
Because of this, we believe it would be unnecessary to mandate procedures for States to follow in cases of closure or
transfer of residents. The Act places the responsibility for closure and/or transfer upon the States and proposed
&sect;488.240, the content of which is now incorporated into &sect;488.426, requires any transfers to be orderly.
We do not believe that any greater procedural specificity is required in Federal regulations. We also do not believe
that it is necessary to define ``emergency.'' We define words only if their definitions will have a narrower application
than definitions commonly found in dictionaries. That is not the case for the use of the word ``emergency'' in this
regulation.

Some commenters insisted that a temporary manager be appointed to oversee the transfers whenever large numbers of
residents are involved. Other commenters believed that States should be required to get a court order before closing
a facility or transferring residents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We do not agree with these comments. We believe the States should retain the flexibility to implement emergency relocation
plans according to the circumstances of each case. The States have the knowledge and experience to choose the optimum
combination of procedures to handle each unique situation. Obtaining a court order could delay the implementation
of the relocation plan in an emergency situation and would add nothing to the process. The same can be said about the
imposition of a temporary manager, because it is the State that is experienced in closure and/or transfer of residents'
situations, not necessarily a temporary manager.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter noted that the Act at section 1919(h)(5) cross references the transfer of residents to sections pertaining
to facility-initiated transfers and discharges. Consequently, the final rule must require States to set up procedures
which include written notice, involvement of ombudsmen and orientation procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 1819(h)(4) and 1919(h)(5) of the Act, which make reference to a resident's rights upon transfer, speak to
them as they relate to the ``safe and orderly transfer of the residents *&blank;*&blank;*'' We believe that whatever
appeal rights individual residents have when the facility in which they reside faces termination bear only on the
appropriateness of the transfer plans for those individuals and not the correctness of the government's decision
to terminate the facility's provider agreement. For example, an individual may disagree with the nature or location
of the facility to which he is slated for transfer and could challenge such a decision under the appeals process provided
by sections 1819(e)(3) and 1919(e)(3) of the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There is no evidence in the Act or the legislative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
history that the Congress intended to vest nursing home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residents with the right to challenge the correctness of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision to take enforcement measures against the facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
That decision lies with either the Secretary or the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and is subject to challenge by the facility, not the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residents. There is no reason to believe that the Congress, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in drafting these provisions, had as its objective the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overturning of the Supreme Court's decision in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
O'Bannon
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Town Court Nursing Center
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 447 U.S. 773 (1980), and we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cannot presume that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
O'Bannon
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 has been overturned by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indirection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, the plain implication of the transfer and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discharge provisions in sections 1819(c) and 1919(c) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act is that their focus is on actions that may face an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual resident of a facility rather than 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility's residents. Thus, subsection (c)(2)(A) speaks to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a transfer or discharge for the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
resident's
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 welfare or for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the health of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
individuals
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in the facility. These imply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individualized determinations, not the kind of facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination that automatically subjects the entire 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare or Medicaid patient population to forced removal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, when describing the documentation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for discharge or transfer, the Act (in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph immediately following the listing of permissible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grounds for such actions) speaks to the necessity for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documentation to appear in the resident's clinical record 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and often times to be entered by the resident's physician. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We know, however, that decisions to terminate a facility's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provider agreement are made by either the Secretary or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State, not by residents' physicians. Thus, it would seem 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the kind of transfer appeals referred to in sections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1819(c)(2) and 1919(c)(2) of the Act do not encompass issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are central to the provider agreement termination, but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rather decisions affecting the fate of an individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resident that may be made by his or her physician. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe that sections 1819(h)(4) and 1919(h)(5) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act give the Secretary and the States discretion in how 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to apply the transfer notice and appeal provisions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sections 1819(c)(2) and 1919(c)(2). The Act's enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions require that the transfer of residents whose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility faces termination be done in a manner ``consistent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with'' the provisions of subsection (c)(2). Had the Congress 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended that there be strict adherence to the Act's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transfer provisions, it could easily have specified that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they be followed precisely. Use of the phrase ``consistent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with,'' however, implies a less rigorous standard that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permits the Secretary and the States to make judgments as to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
how to best accommodate the notice provisions, for example, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
while not compromising the effectiveness of the termination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action. Thus we believe residents should receive as much 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice as possible of their impending transfer as long as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the notice period does not further compromise their quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of care.

remedies that can be used. We are including at &sect;488.404 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the factors to be considered when selecting the most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective enforcement remedy. OBRA '87 included revised and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expanded authority for the enforcement of the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation requirements for long-term care facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which allow State and Federal governments to choose the most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective remedy to encourage rapid compliance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation requirements. We do not agree with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement that civil money penalties are not necessary, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because using civil money penalties as a remedy provides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
another enforcement option for addressing the unique 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characteristics of each case of facility noncompliance.

 A few commenters said that civil money 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalties are not fair and must be reasonable and realistic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The ranges in the amounts of the civil money 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalties are commensurate with the level of SNF or NF 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance and, we believe, permit penalties to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposed in a fair, reasonable and realistic manner. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fact, the higher and wider range of fines ($3,050 to $10,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per day) is reserved for immediate jeopardy deficiencies, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
even though these deficiencies account for a very small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minority of the cases of noncompliance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters expressed concern that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
civil money penalties will drive up the cost to the taxpayer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and increase the government's debt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Increased cost to taxpayers as a result of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
civil money penalties is possible if civil money penalties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are imposed on publicly funded facilities. To the extent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that such a provider's operation is characterized by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies, and costs are excessive, financial burdens are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposed on the taxpayers. However, the money collected from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalties does not increase the Federal debt as it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned to the Medicare Trust Fund or is earmarked for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection of the health or property of Medicaid residents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, money is indirectly returned to the taxpayers' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefit.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters expressed the concern that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
civil money penalties could cause small, independent, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primarily Medicaid supported, rural facilities to be closed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
down, possibly displacing residents from their community 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
home.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We reject this argument. Sections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1819(h)(2)(B)(ii) and 1919(h)(3)(C)(ii) of the Act state 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the Secretary or the State 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
may
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (emphasis added) impose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a civil money penalty. A civil money penalty need not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposed in every situation. The Act provides the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the State the authority to choose a remedy which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corresponds to the unique characteristics of each case. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, &sect;488.438 states that a facility's financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition is a factor considered in determining the amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the civil money penalty.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We do not accept this comment. First, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
money that is collected from civil money penalties is either 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transferred into the Medicare Trust Fund or is earmarked for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the protection of Medicaid residents' health or property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, as soon as substantial compliance is achieved, civil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
money penalties are discontinued. Therefore, the facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is in control of how much money it ultimately is responsible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for paying; that is, the sooner it corrects deficiencies, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the less penalties it will pay.

 A professional organization commented that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed section on civil money penalties does not reflect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all of the points discussed by the Institute of Medicine in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its study, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Improving the Quality of Care in Nursing Homes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1986). The Institute of Medicine envisioned civil money 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalties as a valuable enforcement tool which could be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applied in amounts appropriate to the seriousness, duration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and repeat occurrence of the violation. It recommended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prompt, short hearings on the imposition of the remedy, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fines be large enough to be more costly than the violation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and that fines be versatile enough to be used to correct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minor violations, as well as to immediately punish life 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threatening violations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We believe the regulatory provisions for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
civil money penalties encompass the above referenced points 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the Institute of Medicine. The only point of departure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is the suggestion with regard to promptness. Section 1128A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Act requires that a hearing be provided to a provider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that properly requests one before HCFA collects a civil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
money penalty. Section 1919(h)(8) of the Act requires the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State to offer a hearing before collecting a civil money 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty.

 One commenter suggested that the civil money 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty system be changed to a monetary award program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Facilities in compliance with the regulations would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rewarded. This would lead to improved resident care and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide an incentive for the employees.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We do not accept this comment. Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for civil money penalties are located in sections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1819(h)(2)(B)(ii), 1919(h)(2)(A)(ii) and 1919(h)(3)(C)(ii) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Act as part of an enforcement process. They are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
options that the Secretary and the State may exercise when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SNFs and NFs are not in substantial compliance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation requirements. Removing civil money penalties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as an enforcement option and substituting a monetary reward 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system would not reflect the law as written. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participants in the Medicaid program, the State may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separately establish a program to reward, through public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognition or incentive payments, or both, providers that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide the highest quality care. This reward provision is

 Before developing regulations for civil money

penalties, we met with the nursing home industry, consumer

groups and government entities to obtain input in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development of the proposed rule. In addition, we reviewed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a variety of State civil money penalty systems. We do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe we have sufficient data at this time to justify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
abandoning the system we developed in the proposed rule in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
favor of another or to cause us to consider any State's

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at proposed &sect;488.230(a)(1). The commenter's rationale is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that if facilities are required to pay for every instance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance, compliance would be maintained and additional

 The regulation reflects the corresponding

provisions of the Act. The Act permits HCFA's and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States' discretion in the imposition of this enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedy. The Federal government cannot require the States to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use this remedy in every instance of noncompliance, nor must

it choose this remedy itself in every instance of

recommend a civil money penalty, HCFA could monitor the

 The Act does not permit the Secretary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delegate the authority to impose a civil money penalty on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare participating facility to the State. Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1819(h)(2) of the Act charges the Secretary, upon the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendation of the State, with the authority to impose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies. HCFA's decision to monitor a State's performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not hinge on the imposition of civil money penalties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, any civil money penalties collected under Medicare

will be returned to the Medicare Trust Fund.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A few commenters are concerned that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed definition of deficiency will make any failure to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comply, no matter how small, subject to a fine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We agree with the commenters' concern that, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as described in the proposed rule, very minimal deficiencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could be subject to civil money penalties. As a result, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised the rule and developed enforcement action categories 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which correspond to the seriousness of the deficiencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These enforcement action categories are described at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.408, Selection of remedies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, as discussed previously in this preamble, we are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accepting the commenters' implicit suggestion to incorporate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the concept of substantial compliance as a standard SNFs and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NFs must meet to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. Using the standard of performance of substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance for these providers ensures virtual compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with sections 1819(b), (c), and (d) and 1919(b), (c), and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) of the Act because the type of deficiency tolerated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under a substantial compliance standard is very limited. We 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are defining substantial compliance at &sect;488.301. We 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider substantial compliance to satisfy a facility's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obligation to meet requirements. Therefore, facilities in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial compliance adequately protect the health and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety of nursing home residents and will not be subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a civil money penalty.

 Several commenters were confused and requested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that we clarify the number of days of noncompliance between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two certifications of compliance at proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.230(a)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We revised this paragraph of the rule and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
redesignated it as &sect;488.430(b). It now provides that HCFA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or the State may impose a civil money penalty for the number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of days of past noncompliance since the last standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey, including the days of immediate jeopardy. We 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe that this revision implements sections 1819(h) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1919(h) of the Act, which state that if a facility meets the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d), but as of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previous period did not meet such requirements, a civil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
money penalty could be imposed for the days in which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility was not in compliance with the requirements. We 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe this statutory provision permits a civil money 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty to be imposed whenever there is past noncompliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the participation requirements between standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveys. The following example illustrates one application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this provision: A facility had a survey on July 1, 1993, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and it was in substantial compliance with all of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation requirements. During the orientation tour at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the next survey, June 15, 1994, surveyors observed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
questionable infection control procedures. This observation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prompted the surveyors to further examine records and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility's infection control program. This examination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicated that the facility was out of compliance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
infection control requirements (&sect;483.65) from October 15 to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 30, 1993. However, at the time of the June 15, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994, survey, the facility was again in substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with participation requirements. The number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
days of noncompliance would be 16, which is the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
days between (and including) October 15 and October 30. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This noncompliance existed for 16 days, but it did not exist 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the time of either survey. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although we may have discretion with respect to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selection of remedies to address noncompliance that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrected by the time of a survey, it is likely that we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would give serious consideration to civil money penalties in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such cases. The Act, at sections 1819(h)(1) and 1919(h) (1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and (3), expressly authorizes the impositions of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanctions even if, at the time of the survey, the facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is in substantial compliance.

 We do not accept this suggestion. Adding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this language narrows the authority of the Secretary and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State. Limiting this enforcement authority could allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance to go unsanctioned. We see no justification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for narrowing this authority.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A consumer organization specifically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended we clarify proposed &sect;488.230(a)(2) to say, ``the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty accrues as of the first day that noncompliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existed in a previous period.'' Resident records or resident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
witnesses with corroboration would be sufficient evidence to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine noncompliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In this final rule, we are revising this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph to provide that HCFA or the State may impose a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
civil money penalty for the number of days of past 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance since the last standard survey, including the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of days of immediate jeopardy. It is evident in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situation the civil money penalty could be imposed for all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the days of noncompliance. We do not accept the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggestion to incorporate into the regulation what specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence must be used to determine noncompliance, as each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situation of noncompliance is unique.

 Several commenters recommended that the word 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``impose'' be changed to ``collect'' at proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.230(a)(2), since the Act authorizes the use of civil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
money penalties for past noncompliance that has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 While it is true that the Act specifies that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a civil money penalty may be imposed for past noncompliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that has been corrected, it is not necessarily true that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
civil money penalty will be collected in every case. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instance, if a facility prevails at a hearing, a civil money 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty will not be collected. Accordingly, we are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopting this recommendation.

and the State may not impose a civil money penalty on a

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of all remedies is to protect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residents against inadequate care and to motivate providers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to promptly comply with the participation requirements so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they may continue to provide quality services. Sections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1819(h) and 1919(h) of the Act specify that the State or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA may impose multiple sanctions to achieve these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes. Limiting the authority of the Secretary and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State, as suggested by this comment, would reduce the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ability of the Secretary and the State to tailor remedies to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fit each unique situation of noncompliance, particularly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those situations in which multiple remedies are warranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If HCFA or the State chooses to impose a remedy, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures set forth in &sect;&sect;488.404 and 488.408 of this rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are followed to determine the most appropriate remedy or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters questioned the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of &sect;488.230(b) which stated that HCFA will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the State may not impose a civil money penalty while the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility has a hearing pending on the imposition of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedy. A few commenters recommended that the word ``impose'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be changed to ``collect'' at &sect;488.230(b). Commenters wanted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more information about: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;When a fine begins; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Whether a fine is assessed for the days between the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey date and the hearing date, or only for days after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing date; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Whether there is a conflict between &sect;488.230(b) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.230(i) of the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters' recommendations included: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Stop the assessment of civil money penalties on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date that a formal hearing is requested. If the appeal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outcome upholds the remedy then the civil money penalty is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposed retroactive to the date that the appeal was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Permit the States and HCFA to impose but not collect a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
civil money penalty during the pendency of any hearing. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty would accumulate during the appeal until the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiency is corrected or the appeal is decided; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Do not stop the clock from running on a civil money 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty while the appeal is pending, as this can insulate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliant facilities against the imposition of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalties.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are revising redesignated &sect;488.432 to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more specific and discuss when penalties are collected. We 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
say that, when a facility requests a hearing on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance which led to the imposition of the civil money 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty, HCFA or the State will not initiate collection of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the penalty until a final administrative decision is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rendered which upholds the determination of noncompliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a facility does not request a hearing within the time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period for requesting a hearing, collection of the penalty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will begin when the facility achieves substantial compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or is terminated. If a facility waives its right to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing in writing within 60 days of the date of the notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of intent to impose the penalty, collection is initiated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when the facility achieves substantial compliance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation requirements or is terminated. This section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
now references &sect;488.440, which discusses the accrual of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
civil money penalty and computation and notice of the amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
due, and &sect;488.442, which discusses when payments for civil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
money penalties are due.

A commenter stated the proposed regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not permit the survey agency to impose a remedy for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
second deficiency found as a result of a complaint survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
until a pending hearing on a deficiency cited from a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previous survey is concluded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulatory provision does not compromise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the ability of the Secretary or the State to impose another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedy if one is warranted for a second situation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance before a final administrative decision is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concluded on the first situation of noncompliance which has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
led to the pending imposition of a civil money penalty. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, if a civil money penalty is the preferred remedy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the second instance of noncompliance, as it was for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first, it will not be collected until the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative decision supporting its imposition is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concluded. In this case, the State or HCFA could increase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the civil money penalty amount if the noncompliance found 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
later creates a situation of immediate jeopardy. If the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
second situation of noncompliance results from repeated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies, HCFA or the State would increase the civil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
money penalty. However, the noncompliance found at a later 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time may warrant a remedy other than a civil money penalty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which could be imposed before there is a final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative decision on the first situation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We received many comments stating that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed process will precipitate prolonged appeals without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
civil money penalties ever being assessed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act requires that an administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appeal be provided before civil money penalties are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collected. Even a prolonged appeals process does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eliminate the civil money penalty unless the facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevails at the hearing. For example, if a provider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieves substantial compliance by the time of the appeal, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the correction is only relevant from the standpoint of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of days the penalty applies. The fact that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility achieves substantial compliance before the hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not eliminate the need for the hearing. If the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility does not prevail in the hearing, the civil money 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty is collectible for each day of noncompliance.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters endorsed incorporating a variety of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ideas into the final rule to discourage frivolous appeals, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including the following: provide for the accrual of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest pending appeal at a rate fixed by the State, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stipulate that attorney fees will not be paid and are not an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowable cost if the appeal is unsuccessful, and, as stated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the Institute of Medicine Report, deny payment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provider fees for unsuccessful appeals of survey related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs. Another commenter requested the rule be revised to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include that facilities not be allowed to claim on State or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal income taxes civil money penalties and legal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenses upheld on appeal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We do not support these revisions. It would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be fair practice to assess interest on a civil money 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty before the provider knows the outcome of the hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the imposition of that penalty. To charge interest for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the time period during which a hearing is pending would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tantamount to punishing the provider for exercising its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
right to have an administrative hearing, as provided for in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sections 1128A(c)(2) and 1919(h)(8) of the Act. Regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the comments about attorney fees, other provider costs and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income taxes, these payment issues are not addressed in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act and are beyond the scope of this regulation.

One commenter asked for further clarification

of HCFA notice of penalty and State notice of penalty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of the regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We revised the content of &sect;488.434 to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more specific regarding the notice of intent to impose the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty. The rule now states that, when HCFA proposes to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impose a civil money penalty, it would deliver or send to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the provider written notice of its intent to impose the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty. The notice would include reference to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statutory basis for the penalty; the nature of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance; the amount of the penalty per day of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance; any factors specified in &sect;488.438(f) that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were considered when determining the amount per day of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed penalty; the date the penalty starts accruing; when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the penalty will stop accruing; when collection of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty will be made; and instructions for responding to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice. These instructions would include a specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement of the facility's right to a hearing and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implications of waiving a hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule now states that, when the State imposes a civil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
money penalty in the case of any non-State operated nursing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility, the State must notify the facility in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with State procedures; however, the State's notice must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
written and it must include, at a minimum, the information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified in the HCFA notice of penalty as stated above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few commenters were concerned about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation of civil money penalties if HCFA could not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue the notice in a timely manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although HCFA and the State will proceed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quickly to issue notice of the imposition of the civil money 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty, its imposition does not hinge on specified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notification timeframes. The notice of the imposition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the penalty is not required before a civil money penalty can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
start to accrue, since the Act permits the imposition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
civil money penalties for past violations that have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrected, and the penalty may start accruing as early as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the date the facility was first out of compliance. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these reasons, in &sect;488.402, we exclude the civil money 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty remedy in the discussion of the notification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements when remedies are imposed.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One provider organization recommended revising the notice of penalty section to specify that the State sends the
notice via certified mail in all cases except State operated facilities and other facilities when HCFA is imposing
the penalty based on a validation survey. This comment also listed specifics to be included in the notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter recommended that the notification requirements HCFA uses when it imposes the civil money penalty
must also be the minimal standards applied to the State, instead of allowing the State's notice to be prepared in accordance
with State's procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are not accepting the suggestion that the notice be sent via certified mail because this would preclude sending
a valid notice via other means, such as telefax, telegram, commercial overnight delivery services, or other means
that may be faster. In fact, for these reasons we are revising this section of the rule to eliminate the requirement
that the notice be sent by mail with a return receipt requested. Also, to have the State send the penalty notice to Medicare
participating facilities and to dually participating facilities, as the commenter suggests, would be inappropriate
as HCFA provides notices for Medicare facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We accept the comment to require that the contents included in the HCFA notice of penalty be contained in the State notice
of penalty. Accordingly, as stated in a previous response, we are revising redesignated &sect;488.434 to provide
that the State must notify the facility in accordance with State procedures for all non-State operated NFs when the
State takes the action; however, the State's notice must be written and must include, at a minimum, the information
specified in redesignated &sect;488.434(a). This revision is consistent with existing policy in prescribing the
content of State notices in Medicaid provider termination cases and other Medicaid and AFDC matters.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We received many comments opposing the facility's opportunity to have a 35 percent reduction in the civil money penalty
if the facility waived its right to a hearing. Commenters said that this provision is inappropriate in the regulatory
process, not reflective of Congressional intent, insulting, tantamount to blackmail and plea bargaining and without
statutory basis for offering a bonus to providers who waive their appeal rights. Some commenters objected to the 35
percent reduction if a facility waives its right to a hearing because they felt a justified penalty should be imposed
without any compromise or reduction. Another commenter stated that, if the penalties reflect the deficiencies,
then reducing the penalty amount makes the penalty lose some of its deterrent value. One commenter was concerned that
the waiver of hearing provision, as written, may induce HCFA or the State to inflate the penalty. Then, if the penalty
is reduced 35 percent because of the waiver, the fine amount is the amount it would have been before the reduction.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter agreed with this regulatory provision on waiver of a hearing and stated that this is appropriate since
informal conflict resolution can be used to eliminate misunderstandings or deficiencies that are not supported
by the evidence.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 35 percent reduction in the civil money penalty afforded providers for waiver of right to appeal is based on a State
model (&sect;488.436). Providers are free to reject the option to waive the right to a hearing. The intent behind this
regulatory provision is to encourage facilities to carefully consider their position in terms of substantial compliance,
as well as the costs they will incur in litigating the matter, before tying up already overburdened hearing resources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, if we are not confronted with the administrative costs of litigation, we believe we should consider offsetting
civil money penalty amounts accordingly. On its face, these waiver provisions could seem to lessen the deterrent
value of the civil money penalty. However, a 35 percent reduction of a $10,000 per day civil money penalty leaves a penalty
amount of $6,500 per each day of noncompliance, and this is a significant deterrent to continued noncompliance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We disagree with the comment that the waiver provision may induce HCFA or the State to inflate the penalty because the
per day amount of the civil money penalty will be determined before the facility would have the opportunity to exercise
its option to waive a hearing. This is because the notice of the intent to impose the penalty includes the amount of the
penalty per day of noncompliance, as well as the option to waive the hearing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding dispute resolution, we appreciate the support of this commenter and agree that dispute resolution is an
appropriate vehicle afforded the provider to address survey finding issues.

 The opportunity to waive the right to a hearing and consequently receive a 35 percent reduction in the amount of the
civil money penalty does not permit the facility to deny the existence of deficiencies for any purpose, nor will waiver
of the right to a hearing remove the deficiencies from the facility's record. When a facility waives its right to a hearing,
it is in effect not contesting the deficiency.

 We erred in the proposed text. We accept the suggestion and intended to require that, when a facility requests a waiver
of a hearing in writing, within the 60 day timeframe, HCFA or the State reduces the civil money penalty amount by 35 percent,
and we are revising the final rule accordingly. We are also adding a paragraph to specify that, if the facility does
not waive its right to a hearing, in writing, within 60 days from the date of the notice of intent to impose the penalty,
the civil money penalty is not reduced. We believe the specified timeframe gives the provider ample opportunity to
decide whether or not to exercise its option to waive a hearing.

 One commenter stated that allowing a reduction in the amount of the civil money penalty will necessitate that States
develop and implement complicated and costly accounting systems for recordkeeping and reporting purposes. Another
commenter suggested that the collection of civil money penalties will be very confusing and they would rather have
lower penalty amounts than the opportunity for a 35 percent reduction.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Less litigation as a result of the waiver of hearing provision more than compensates for the recordkeeping and reporting
necessary to implement the 35 percent reductions in civil money penalties. We are striving not only to reduce litigation
costs but also to reduce the considerable investment of time necessary to prepare for and participate in a hearing.
Imposing lower fine amounts instead of allowing the 35 percent reduction for a waiver is not in keeping with the reasons,
as stated above, for having this provision.

 A few commenters requested that the reduction of the civil money penalty amount when a facility waives its right to
a hearing be 50 percent. Another suggestion was permitting a reduction of up to 35 percent. One commenter recommended
the percent reduction be 10 percent and only available upon prompt payment.

 We believe that 35 percent is reasonable and appropriate, based on our review of an existing State model, and it approximates
the savings we believe are possible by not litigating these cases.

 One commenter suggested that the waiver of appeal rights submitted be written and that 50 percent of the civil money
penalty be paid within 15 days from the date of notification.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We accept the suggestion that the waiver be in writing and have made this revision in the final rule. We do not accept
the suggestion that 50 percent of the penalty be paid within 15 days from the date of the receipt of a request to waive
appeal rights. If a facility waives its right to request a hearing in accordance with the provisions specified in &sect;488.436,
and subsequently receives a 35 percent reduction in the amount of the penalty owed, we do not believe it is necessary
to also offer the facility the opportunity to pay only 50 percent of the civil money penalty at that time. To accept partial
payments of a civil money penalty creates an unnecessary recordkeeping system and detracts from the financial incentive
to motivate compliance which civil money penalties were intended to create. Also, we specified in the regulation
that the entire penalty is payable on the due date, and that date would be 15 days after receipt of the waiver request
if the facility has achieved substantial compliance with the requirements or the facility has been terminated. However,
if the facility has not achieved substantial compliance or been terminated when the waiver request is received, the
civil money penalty would continue to accrue until the facility achieves substantial compliance or is terminated.
The due dates for civil money penalties are specified in &sect;488.442.

We do not accept the commenters'

recommendations to change the number of days in which a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility may request or waive its right to a hearing. The

existing 60 day timeframe to request a hearing has been

effective in accommodating the needs of the government to

move quickly in situations of noncompliance without unduly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compromising the due process considerations of the provider. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It often provides sufficient time to the facility to resolve

disagreements prior to the initiation of costly litigation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or, failing resolution of disagreements, adequate time to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepare for a hearing. To adopt a shorter timeframe, as

Many commenters believed that the civil money

penalty fines of up to $10,000 a day are excessive and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exorbitant. A few comments stated that the range is too

broad and would create inconsistency on a national level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters said that imposing civil money penalties for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-immediate jeopardy deficiencies is severely punitive and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``overreacting'' and they should only be imposed in severe,

The Act allows a maximum civil money penalty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of $10,000 per day of noncompliance. By designating the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
highest two thirds of the civil money penalties as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediate jeopardy range, we believe we have developed a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system for the States to use under which relatively few 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities will be subject to a maximum penalty. We expect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the higher penalties will seldom be imposed, because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situations involving immediate jeopardy occur far less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequently than those with no immediate jeopardy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the range of civil money penalties for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediate jeopardy cases is broad enough to allow us the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flexibility to impose the maximum civil money penalty in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only the most egregious cases and some lower amount within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the range for other situations of immediate jeopardy. We 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe penalties imposed in the immediate jeopardy range 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are justified because residents are in life threatening 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situations, and we want to motivate the facility to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediately correct deficiencies. We set the amounts of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalties within the two ranges to allow consideration of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the unique characteristics of each situation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance. It is inappropriate to refer to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``consistent'' application of civil money penalties because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each situation of noncompliance and the factors that affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the amount of the civil money penalty are unique for each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility.

A State can use its licensure civil money penalty system for Medicaid purposes when it has demonstrated its effectiveness
in accordance with &sect;488.406. These provisions state that alternative State remedies for facilities participating
in Medicaid may be imposed if the State demonstrates to HCFA's satisfaction that the alternative remedies are as effective
in deterring noncompliance and correcting deficiencies as the HCFA remedies.

A few commenters recommended that civil money penalties be significantly reduced, because if a facility receives
a civil money penalty of $5,000 or more, that facility loses its ability to train nurse aides.

Response:

As stated above, the $10,000 per day civil money penalty limit is established in the Act. While the Act gives the State
and the Secretary the discretion to impose a penalty as high as the limit, we will not, as a matter of policy, lower civil
money penalty amounts in specific cases to preclude facilities from losing their ability to train nurse aides. If
a civil money penalty of $5,000 or more is imposed on a facility, it is indicative of the fact that an egregious situation
of immediate jeopardy exists. In this case, we believe the facility's ability to continue to train nurse aides is compromised
and the facility should lose approval of its nurse aide training and competency evaluation program. However, as we
have already stated, we anticipate that the higher penalties will seldom be imposed, as situations involving immediate
jeopardy occur far less frequently than those with no immediate jeopardy.

One commenter recommended revising proposed &sect;488.230(f)(2) to specify that a civil money penalty may not be
one of the alternative remedies imposed when a facility does not meet the eligibility criteria for continuation of
payment and HCFA will or the State must terminate a provider's agreement. Also, the commenter recommended that neither
HCFA nor the State may impose more than four penalties against a facility on the basis of a single survey and the maximum
total penalty amount that may be imposed against a facility during any twelve-month period is five hundred dollars
per licensed or certified bed.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act does not preclude the imposition of a civil money penalty remedy as an enforcement option when the facility
does not meet the eligibility criteria for continuation of payment or is terminated. In fact, section 1919(h)(7)
of the Act discusses the special rules applicable when other remedies additional or alternative to termination are
imposed. Concerning the specified amount of the penalty that can be imposed per licensed or certified bed during a
specific time period, the Act does not specify such a limitation, and utilizing these limitations would unnecessarily
restrict the authority of the Secretary and the State to tailor a civil money penalty remedy to the specific situation
of noncompliance. However, the Act does set dollar limitations for each day of noncompliance. Therefore, the Act
contemplates that all deficiencies will be aggregated for the purposes of determining the number of days of noncompliance
(as opposed to the number of deficiencies).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few commenters requested that we clarify if survey agencies may exceed the specified penalty ranges when a facility
alleges compliance but a revisit by HCFA or the State finds noncompliance. One commenter recommended that the penalty
be doubled in this situation even if it exceeds the penalty limit. Another commenter suggested replacing 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
may 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
shall 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
at proposed &sect;488.230(f)(3) so that this section reads, ``HCFA or the State shall increase the daily penalty
if the facility alleges compliance *&blank;*&blank;*.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter disagreed with &sect;488.230(f)(3) concerning HCFA's or the State's ability to increase the daily
penalty if the facility alleges compliance but a revisit finds noncompliance. The commenter recommended including
an objective and quantifiable basis for increasing such penalties or deleting this regulatory provision. Another
commenter suggested increasing the civil money penalty when a facility alleges completion of its plan of correction,
but a revisit finds the facility has not completed its plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, we are revising redesignated &sect;488.438 to provide that a civil money penalty would be decreased
to the lower range of penalty amounts if a revisit determines that the immediate jeopardy is removed but the noncompliance
continues. However, if the noncompliance, that continues constitutes repeated deficiencies in the same regulatory
grouping of requirements, the civil money penalty would be increased, as specified in sections 1819(h)(2)(B) and
1919(h)(2)(A) and (h)(3)(C) of the Act. A civil money penalty could be increased to the upper range of penalty amounts
if deficiencies for which a lower level penalty amount was imposed have become sufficiently serious to pose immediate
jeopardy. We are also revising &sect;488.438 to provide that civil money penalties are increased, even if a new penalty
amount exceeds the range for nonimmediate jeopardy, when deficiencies in the same regulatory grouping of requirements
for which a civil money penalty was imposed are repeated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We cannot accept the suggestion to increase a civil money penalty if a facility does not follow its plan of correction.
When a remedy is lifted for a facility, it is based on that facility's substantial compliance with the requirements,
not on the facility's adherence to its plan of correction. The health or safety of a resident could be jeopardized by
a situation in which a plan of correction was followed but the facility was still not in substantial compliance with
the participation requirements.

One commenter stated that there is no provision in the regulation which would prohibit daily penalties from mounting.
This commenter added that this is not reflective of the Congressional intent behind sections 1819(h)(3) and 1919(h)(4)
of the Act, which says that a finding to deny payment terminates when the State or Secretary finds that the facility
is in substantial compliance with the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A facility can always stop the accrual of a civil money penalty by correcting the situation that caused the noncompliance.
With regard to all remedies, we received many comments recommending that the standard of substantial compliance
with sections 1819(b), (c), and (d) and 1919(b), (c), and (d) of the Act be incorporated into the rule as an acceptable
measure of compliance. As discussed previously in this preamble, we accept this comment and we will lift remedies
imposed for noncompliance when a facility is in substantial compliance with sections 1819(b), (c), and (d) and 1919(b),
(c), and (d) of the Act.

A few commenters requested we add, at proposed &sect;488.230(f), that interest accrues on all penalties not settled,
at the credit card rate, from the date of citation.

We do not accept this comment. Redesignated &sect;488.438 discusses the base amount of the civil money penalties.
We do not think it is appropriate to incorporate the interest rate in this section. A discussion of interest follows
in redesignated &sect;488.442.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter suggested that when noncompliance could financially benefit a facility, the amount of the penalty
should never be less than twice what the State or HCFA can reasonably assume to have been the savings to the facility,
as a facility should never believe it is in its financial self-interest to violate the law. This commenter also said
that HCFA and the State should have access to any data (employee salaries, fees, supply costs, etc.) that will provide
necessary information to determine the amount of the penalty. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We do not agree. First, it would be beyond the scope of this rule to require the State to determine or for HCFA to try to
determine when noncompliance would financially benefit a facility. Moreover, to provide that civil money penalties
be twice the presumed savings incurred by the facility would be to establish an arbitrary requirement that would unnecessarily
complicate using civil money penalties as an enforcement option. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A facility that perceives it is in its financial self interest to violate the law commits a grave error as it could face
termination of its provider agreement for noncompliance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few commenters recommended that all minimum penalty amounts specified at proposed &sect;488.230(f) and the ``per
day'' modifiers in the regulation be deleted to permit the Secretary or the State more discretion when imposing civil
money penalty amounts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We do not accept these comments. The minimum penalty amount is set at $50 because we believe that any lesser amount would
not be a remedy for any provider. The $50 minimum penalty amount also corresponds to the imposition of civil money penalties
in increments of $50; this process was designed for purposes of simplicity of implementation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act specifies that a civil money penalty may be imposed for each day of noncompliance. We believe that removing
references to ``per day'' alters the clear instructions specified in the Act. Furthermore, the Secretary and the
State always have discretion to impose or not to impose a civil money penalty, since the law states that a civil money
penalty 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
may
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 be imposed for each day of noncompliance.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters responded that the factors used to determine the amount of the civil money penalty are too broad and
will promote inconsistency. A commenter posed that these factors are subjective, not uniform, and therefore, are
challengeable in a court of law. A few commenters suggested removing the factors used to determine the amount of the
civil money penalty from the final regulation while a few said that HCFA and the State should be required to give due
consideration to the information provided by the facility.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters were generally negative in response to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using the facility's financial condition as a factor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affecting the amount of penalty and offered the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arguments about this policy: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;It is not equitable; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;It would result in inconsistent civil money penalties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the same deficiency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Poorly managed and/or not-for-profit facilities should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be excused or pay a lower civil money penalty; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;It discriminates against facilities that are more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solvent; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;It is inappropriate if the facility can not appeal the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of the penalty; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Neither the Secretary nor the States have adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information to evaluate a facility's financial condition; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;It would be difficult to apply objectively and would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require an audit of the facility; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The regulation does not clarify how financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information is obtained, who evaluates this information and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if it will be available promptly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter requested that we remove a facility's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial condition as a factor and consider instead the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
location of the facility and the percent of Medicaid or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare patient days relative to the total patient days of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters suggested including the facility's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
degree of culpability as a factor in determining the amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the civil money penalty as mentioned in the preamble of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In determining the amount of the penalty, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1128A of the Act, which is incorporated by reference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into sections 1819(h) and 1919(h) of the Act, requires the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary to consider specific matters and also provides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority to take into account any other items relevant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the penalty determination. We are requiring the State to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also consider these specific matters to make Medicare and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid requirements equivalent for SNFs and NFs. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific matters the Secretary and the State must take into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
account, as stipulated in section 1128A of the Act, include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the facility's degree of culpability, history of prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offenses and financial condition. Therefore, we cannot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remove financial condition as the commenters suggested, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we are revising redesignated &sect;488.438(f) to include the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility's degree of culpability, which was inadvertently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
omitted from the proposed regulatory text. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We explain in &sect;488.438 what we mean by ``culpability'' in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the context of provider certification. Section 1128A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorizes civil money penalties for criminal or quasi-criminal acts, such as, false claims or claims for charges

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in excess of those permitted by law. The intent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual who commits one of these acts plays a prominent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
role in determining the amount of the civil money penalty. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, if this individual submits a false claim while 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the influence of drugs or the individual has a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
psychiatric condition, that person's culpability for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitting false claims may be reduced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The enforcement provisions for civil money penalties in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sections 1819(h) and 1919(h) incorporate section 1128A of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act and require a consideration of a facility's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
culpability in determining the amount of the civil money 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty. However, this consideration is not limited to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situations in which a provider ``intends'' for a situation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance to exist. In fact, a facility is culpable if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance causing harm or placing a resident at risk of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harm is intentional or is a product of neglect, indifference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or disregard. While a facility's culpability for serious 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance is a factor in the determination of the amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the civil money penalty, the absence of culpability is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not a factor, as a facility is always fully responsible for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the health and safety of its residents.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter asked that we specifically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
define ``history'' as used at proposed &sect;488.230(g)(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter suggested that the facility's history of

prior compliance only include the period of operation under

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Information concerning a facility's history 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of noncompliance, as discussed with regard to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.438(f)(1) of the final rule, is maintained in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State survey agency, the HCFA regional office and the Online 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Survey Certification and Reporting system (OSCAR). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSCAR system can provide facility specific reports from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
four most recent surveys. We do not accept the comment that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the facility's history of prior noncompliance only include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that of the current owner because when a change of ownership 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurs, all Medicare penalties and sanctions are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
automatically assigned to the new owner or owners with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exception of the two year restriction on Nurse Aide Training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Competency Evaluation Programs (which is explained later

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters suggested that we provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that if a facility wants its financial condition considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it must fully disclose all financial information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As stated above, it is a statutory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement that a facility's financial condition be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered as a factor to determine the amount of the civil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
money penalty. We do not specify in the regulation what we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will examine in determining the facility's financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition, because these factors are unique for each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility to furnish the information it believes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriately represents its financial status. We consider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a facility's financial condition in conjunction with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other factors specified in the rule when determining the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of a civil money penalty, because it is not our 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intent to put facilities out of business, and the amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the civil money penalty is determined on a case by case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We received a suggestion to remove the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility's financial condition as a factor in determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the amount of the civil money penalty but to permit the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility an opportunity to negotiate a payment schedule if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it can demonstrate that the civil money penalty would cause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial hardship after the assessment and final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjudication of a civil money penalty.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We do not accept this comment. First, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously stated, it is a statutory requirement to consider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a facility's financial condition as a factor in determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the amount of the penalty. Second, to negotiate a payment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
schedule based on the facility's financial condition after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the assessment and final adjudication of a civil money 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty would not be necessary since the facility's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial condition has already been considered in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination of the penalty amount.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Many commenters submitted examples of existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State civil money penalty systems which assigned a specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dollar amount per bed to each scope and severity level or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assigned a maximum daily fine amount for each scope and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
severity level. Another commenter asked that we clarify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that there will not be a correlation between the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beds and the amount of the civil money penalty. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are revising &sect;&sect;488.404 and 488.408 to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correlate the seriousness of the deficiencies with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selection of remedies when HCFA or the State chooses to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impose a remedy. (See explanation at &sect;488.404, Factors to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be considered in selecting remedies and &sect;488.408, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Selection of remedies.) Civil money penalties may be used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for deficiencies constituting immediate jeopardy. Civil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
money penalties may also be used for deficiencies which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constitute no actual harm but have a potential for more than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimal harm; or for deficiencies that constitute actual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We do not accept the comment suggesting assigning a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dollar amount per bed because the regulation, in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with section 1128A of the Act, requires a consideration of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility's financial condition in the determination of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
civil money penalty amount. We assume that a primary reason 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some States compute civil money penalty amounts based on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of beds is to take into account the financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition of facilities, that is, the larger facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be presumed to have a greater availability of cash 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than the smaller facilities. This is not necessarily the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
case, and even if it were a valid consideration in some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cases, to take this relationship into account would be to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider financial condition twice. Nor have we assigned a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific dollar amount for each degree of seriousness.

 In response to the concern raised by this

commenter, we are revising redesignated &sect;488.438(f). We 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are replacing the phrase, ``The scope, severity, and duration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the noncompliance'' with, ``The factors in section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
488.404.'' The factors specified in &sect;488.404 address the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment of the seriousness of deficiencies and include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessing the scope, severity and duration of the

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A commenter suggested the specific category of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the unmet requirement be a factor in determining the amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the penalty. Another commenter asked that we explain the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difference between ``health and safety requirements'' and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``administrative requirements'' as stated in &sect;488.230(g)(4) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the proposed regulation. We also received many 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendations to revise this regulatory provision to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require that HCFA or the State consider whether the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements with which the facility is out of compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are health and safety requirements, residents' rights, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality of life or failure to attain the highest practicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functioning or administrative requirements when determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the amount of the civil money penalty.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 After considering the above comments, we are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eliminating this provision because we believe that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors inherent in this provision are reflected in revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.438(f), which now requires the consideration of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors contained in &sect;488.404 when determining the amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the penalty. These factors include consideration of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether the facilities' deficiencies constitute: no actual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harm, with a potential for minimal harm; no actual harm, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the potential for more than minimal harm that is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediate jeopardy; actual harm that is not immediate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jeopardy; or immediate jeopardy to resident health or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety. These factors also require considering whether the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A few commenters recommended that civil money 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalties be mandatory for all substandard quality of care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies, immediate jeopardy situations and repeated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies at their proposed severity level 1 and scope of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3 or 4. A few other commenters who proposed a new scope and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
severity grid suggested that we modify the civil money 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty provisions to reflect the grid that they proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested doubling the civil money penalty for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repeated deficiencies, and another suggested simply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increasing the penalty for repeated deficiencies. Other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters requested that we add a description of civil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
money penalties that would include a flat, one time fine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Single deficiencies regardless of the severity; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Deficiencies with a starting point that cannot be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Repeated deficiencies; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Deficiencies where the State finds it more difficult 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to document continuous noncompliance.

penalties be imposed at specific scope and severity levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We do not accept these recommendations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requiring that civil money penalties be imposed for specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
types of deficiencies would be inconsistent with the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which provides that civil money penalties 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
may 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(emphasis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
added) be imposed for each day of noncompliance. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary does not have the authority to require the States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to impose civil money penalties where the Act gives States' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discretion. While the Secretary could implement a policy by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which each specific degree of seriousness would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
automatically precipitate civil money penalties at specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amounts, such a policy would undermine the Secretary's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flexibility to tailor enforcement action to the exact nature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of deficiencies in specific facilities. As a matter of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policy, we will limit the use of civil money penalties to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more serious deficiencies. Civil money penalties are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included as a remedy choice when the seriousness of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies is such that Category 2 or Category 3 remedies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be applicable, as specified in &sect;488.408, Selection of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In cases of repeated or uncorrected deficiencies, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposing a flat, one time civil money penalty for these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies would ignore the statutory requirement to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide for the imposition of incrementally more severe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fines for repeated or uncorrected deficiencies as specified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in sections 1819(h)(2)(B), 1919(h)(2)(A), and 1919(h)(3)(C) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Act. While we are providing in redesignated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.438 that penalties are increased for repeated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies in the same regulatory grouping of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements, we do not accept the recommendation to double 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fines because mandating the magnitude of the increase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would detract from the kind of flexibility the Congress gave 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the Secretary and the States. With regard to uncorrected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies, we may propose to increase a civil money 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty for those cases in which a lower level penalty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount was imposed should those uncorrected deficiencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
become sufficiently serious to pose immediate jeopardy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assign a flat, one time fine to a single deficiency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regardless of its seriousness does not take into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration the factors included in section 1128A of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act and specified in &sect;488.438 of this final rule, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ignores the fact that the Act mandates that a civil money 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty, when imposed, be computed for each day of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance. The Act contemplates the imposition of civil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
money penalties for whatever period HCFA or the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determines the noncompliance exists. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A commenter asked if the hearing officer makes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the assessment decision on the amount of the civil money 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As previously stated, when a facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requests a hearing on the noncompliance which led to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposition of the civil money penalty, HCFA or the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not initiate collection of the penalty until a final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative decision is rendered which upholds the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination of noncompliance. Upon further analysis, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are adding a paragraph to redesignated &sect;488.438 to explain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the reviewability of the civil money penalty that is imposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on a SNF or NF for noncompliance with participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. We now specify that in any case in which an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative law judge or State hearing officer (or higher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative review authority) finds that the basis for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposing a civil money penalty exists, as described in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.430, the administrative law judge or State hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officer (or higher administrative review authority) may not: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
set a penalty of zero or reduce a penalty to zero; review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the exercise of discretion by the Secretary or the State to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impose a civil money penalty; or consider any factors in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reviewing the amount of the penalty other than those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified at &sect;488.438(f). In other words, when the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative law judge or State hearing officer (or higher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative review authority) finds noncompliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supporting the imposition of the civil money penalty, he or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
she must remedy it with some amount of penalty consistent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the ranges of penalty amounts established in &sect;488.438. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This provision is consistent with other provisions specified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in this rule to motivate a SNF's and NF's compliance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation requirements in which we state that these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providers have the opportunity to appeal certifications of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance leading to an enforcement remedy. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision is also consistent with section 1128A(d) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act, which requires that specific factors be considered in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining the amount of any penalty.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We received many comments on the effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date of the civil money penalty. Some commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended that the effective date: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Be stayed if a hearing is requested; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Begin on the date an appeals decision is issued; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Begin on the date the facility receives notice of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed penalty. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter recommended that no civil money penalty be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposed if the facility is in compliance by the effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date of the notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters advocated that this regulatory section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be changed to require that the effective date of the civil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
money penalty be the date when the deficiency began as can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be documented by the surveyors. They said that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective date provision of the proposed rule: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Implies a ``grace period'' for providers to correct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Is inconsistent with OBRA '87; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Contradicts &sect;488.230(a)(2) of the proposed rule; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Undermines the States' ability to use civil money 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalties; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Defeats the deterrent effect of this remedy and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
goal of encouraging prompt compliance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are revising redesignated &sect;488.440 after thoughtful consideration of the many comments received. We are
changing the heading of paragraph (a) to read, ``When penalty begins to accrue.'' This phrase is more appropriate
in the context of a civil money penalty since this penalty cannot be collected until the provider has an opportunity
for a hearing if one is requested; however, it can begin to accrue before the hearing. Also, this revision includes
the accrual of the civil money penalty for past days of noncompliance since the last standard survey which are corrected
by the time of the current survey as provided in the Act at sections 1819(h) and 1919(h). Revised paragraph (a) now provides
that the civil money penalty may start accruing as early as the date that the facility was first out of compliance, as
determined by HCFA or the State. To stay the accrual of the penalty if a hearing is requested, to start the accrual when
a hearing decision is made, or to begin the accrual on the date of the notice, as the commenters suggest, would allow
noncompliance to continue without a remedy being imposed and would not be implementing the remedy as the Congress
intended. This intent is clearly stated in the Committee report that accompanied OBRA '87:

*&blank;*&blank;* the Committee amendment would expressly allow a State to impose civil money penalties for each
day in which a facility was found out of compliance with one or more of the requirements of participation, even if the
facility subsequently corrected its deficiencies and brought itself into full compliance. This, in the Committee's
view, is essential to creating a financial incentive for facilities to maintain compliance with the requirements
for participation. The Committee amendment would set no upper limit on the amount of these penalties and would allow
States to increase the amounts in cases of repeated noncompliance. States could impose civil money penalties prior
to a hearing.

Moving the date when the penalty can accrue to be as early as the date of the noncompliance permits noncompliance to
be sanctioned promptly and addresses the concerns of the commenters who said that the effective date in the proposed
rule implied a ``grace period'' for providers to correct deficiencies before a civil money penalty was imposed and
undermined the States' abilities to use this remedy. We expect that in virtually all cases, the civil money penalty
would start accruing from the date of the noncompliance. The only exception could be those cases in which the survey
identifies the noncompliance but there is undue delay before HCFA or the State notifies the provider of the imposition
of the penalty. However, the provider would receive a second notice before the collection of the civil money penalty,
as explained in &sect;488.440.

A commenter recommended deleting proposed &sect;488.230(i)(6) (redesignated as &sect;488.440(g)), which provides
that, in the case of immediate and serious threat deficiencies, HCFA will or the State must terminate the provider
agreement on the 23rd day after the appointment of temporary management if the threat remains.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We do not accept the suggestion to delete this provision because we believe it is important to specify the situations
that affect the accrual of civil money penalties. However, we are revising redesignated &sect;488.440(g) to specify
that termination occurs within 23 days after the last day of the survey if immediate jeopardy remains, and the daily
accrual of civil money penalties stops on that day.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters suggested that the regulation incorporate a provision assuring prompt revisits by HCFA or the States
to evaluate compliance based upon a facility's allegation of compliance, because several commenters stated that
survey teams often are not prompt in the follow-up process. Others asked if civil money penalties accrue when a revisit
is not timely. Several commenters asked that we clarify if there must be on-site revisits by the State to verify reports
by facilities. One commenter requested revisits be within a specified timeframe and another specified a 10 day timeframe
in which revisits must be conducted. One commenter recommended that civil money penalties be suspended immediately
(until the survey team can revisit) when authorities receive notification through certified mail that deficiencies
have been corrected.

Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While we understand the concern expressed by the commenters that surveyors conduct prompt revisits to confirm substantial
compliance, the fact remains that when a SNF or NF participates in the Medicare and/or Medicaid program, that facility
agrees to maintain substantial compliance with the participation requirements. When a civil money penalty or any
other remedy is imposed upon a SNF or NF, it is because it has not maintained substantial compliance with these requirements,
and we want to motivate corrective action. While HCFA and the States will try to revisit the facility in as timely a fashion
as possible, when a revisit is necessary to verify substantial compliance, neither HCFA nor the States will be constrained
by a specified timeframe in which to conduct these revisits. Nor will HCFA or the States suspend a penalty until a revisit
can be conducted. The revisit would not be necessary if the SNF or NF had met its commitment to remain in substantial
compliance with the participation requirements. Therefore, it is the provider's poor performance that has generated
the need for a revisit. Moreover, timeframes for revisits can vary from State to State and within a State due to geographical
variations and available personnel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hence, in those cases in which an on-site revisit is determined necessary to verify that the SNF or NF has come back into
substantial compliance with participation requirements, civil money penalties may accrue from as early as the date
the facility was first out of compliance, as determined by HCFA or the State, until the date of the revisit which finds
substantial compliance. Or, the civil money penalty may accrue from as early as the date the facility was first out
of compliance, as determined by HCFA or the State, until the date substantial compliance was achieved as documented
by written credible evidence submitted to, and accepted by, HCFA or the State before an on-site revisit, but which,
in certain situations, must be confirmed by an on-site revisit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sometimes an on-site revisit is not necessary to establish that a facility has come back into substantial compliance;
in those cases, the civil money penalty may accrue from as early as the date the facility was first out of compliance,
as determined by HCFA or the State, until the date for which there is written credible evidence of substantial compliance
which is acceptable to HCFA or the State without the on-site visit. In these cases, there is no reason to ``assure''
the timeframe of a revisit as stated by a commenter. In response to the concerns and questions of the commenters, we
are revising &sect;488.438(h) to provide for the policies expressed above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters asked what documentation will be acceptable to HCFA or the State as credible evidence as stated
in proposed &sect;488.230(i)(7) (redesignated as &sect;488.440(h)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to appropriately respond to each unique situation of noncompliance, HCFA or the State will evaluate written
credible evidence on a case by case basis. HCFA and the State have the discretion to determine what constitutes written
credible evidence. For example, a survey may determine that a facility's furnace is broken constituting a deficiency
for violating a Physical Environment requirement by its failure to maintain all essential mechanical, electrical
and patient care equipment in safe operating condition (&sect;488.70(c)(2)). In such a case, the facility may buy
a new furnace, have it installed, and submit the receipt to the State or HCFA as written credible evidence of substantial
compliance. If this written credible evidence is accepted by HCFA or the State, the accrual of the civil money penalty
would stop as of the date substantial compliance was achieved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sometimes substantial compliance can be achieved before an on-site revisit and the retroactive substantial compliance
date can be verified with an on-site revisit. For example, during a closed record review (which is an examination of
the records of discharged, transferred or deceased residents), it may be determined that a facility was not recording
the reason for transfer or discharge in the residents' clinical records. This would be a violation of a requirement
under Admission, Transfer and Discharge Rights set forth at 42 CFR 483.12. Since it would be inappropriate to send
residents' records in the mail as evidence of correction, a revisit would be necessary. During the revisit on May 30,
1994, documentation confirms that the facility came into compliance with this requirement on May 10, 1994, 20 days
before the revisit. Since the revisit confirms compliance with this requirement as having occurred on May 10, 1994,
the accrual of the civil money penalty for the facility could be from as early as the date the facility was first out of
compliance as determined by HCFA or the State until the date for which the revisit established that substantial compliance
was achieved, which would be May 10, 1994 in this example. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are other cases in which documentation cannot confirm the correction of noncompliance, and in these cases an
on-site revisit is necessary. For example, one of the requirements for Infection Control is that personnel must handle,
store, process and transport linens so as to prevent the spread of infection as specified in &sect;483.65. If a deficiency
is cited for a violation of this requirement and a civil money penalty is imposed, submitting written documentation
would not confirm the correction of the violation. An on-site revisit to observe personnel behavior is necessary
in this case to confirm that the facility is, in fact, back in substantial compliance with this regulatory provision.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter stated that fines should accrue until a follow-up survey confirms compliance. This commenter said
proposed &sect;488.230(i)(7) should be revised because it rests on a clause rejected by OBRA '87 that paper review
cannot adequately determine compliance. The commenter also said that if a facility requests a survey and is found
out of compliance, the facility would be held liable for the costs of the survey.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We do not accept this comment. First, we are not suggesting that written credible evidence submitted to HCFA or the
State can confirm substantial compliance in every situation. We are well aware that not every deficiency can be determined
to be corrected by written evidence as not every requirement is related to a written record. OBRA '87 did increase the
number of outcome oriented requirements and reduce the number of paper compliance requirements; however, it did
not eliminate all paper compliance requirements. The examples used in the discussion of the comment above describe
situations in which written credible evidence can confirm substantial compliance. When we can confirm substantial
compliance without an on-site revisit, valuable resources can be conserved, creating a savings for the taxpayer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We do not accept the comment to charge the facility for the costs of the survey when it alleges substantial compliance
but is found to be noncompliant at a revisit. The Act does not include the imposition of a survey charge as an available
remedy.

A commenter asked how a facility will notify the State when it has corrected the noncompliance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When a facility has corrected the noncompliance, it may notify the State in whatever manner it feels is most appropriate.
For instance, in certain situations written credible evidence sent through the mail will be the best method of notification.
In other cases a telephone call to request an on-site revisit will be the most appropriate method of notification.

A commenter asked how penalties will be computed during the interim when a facility believes it is in compliance and
a survey team, upon revisit, disagrees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While a revisit is pending, the penalties continue to accrue at the rate originally specified by HCFA or the State.
However, HCFA or the State may propose to increase the daily penalty if a facility with nonimmediate jeopardy deficiencies
alleges compliance, but on a revisit, HCFA or the State finds that the facility's deficiencies have become sufficiently
serious to pose immediate jeopardy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When a facility disagrees with the decision made at the time of the revisit, this disagreement could be resolved through
the administrative hearing process. HCFA has authority to settle cases at any time prior to a final administrative
decision for facilities in which HCFA's enforcement action prevails. The State has authority to settle cases at any
time prior to the evidentiary hearing decision for all cases in which the State's enforcement action prevails. These
provisions are specified in redesignated &sect;488.444. However, a civil money penalty would not be computed and
collected until substantial compliance is verified, HCFA's or the State's decision of noncompliance is upheld after
a final administrative decision, the facility waives its right to a hearing, or the facility is terminated.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter suggested adding a new provision to require that follow-up surveys be conducted within 10 days of the
facility notifying the State or HCFA that it has substantially corrected deficiencies. The penalty is terminated
on the date the facility provided the notice if the deficiencies are substantially corrected at the time of the revisit
or the 10 day period for a revisit has elapsed and the revisit has not occurred. If a revisit determines the scope and
severity of the deficiencies has changed, the penalty amount is adjusted and the penalty is effective on the date of
the facility's notice.

We cannot accept this comment in total. However, as previously explained in this preamble, we are accepting the commenters'
suggestion to incorporate the concept of substantial compliance into the regulation as the standard providers must
meet to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs as SNFs or NFs. Consequently, a remedy is lifted when deficiencies
lessen to the point that the facility is in substantial compliance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amount of the civil money penalty is increased to reflect repeated deficiencies in the same regulatory grouping
of requirements. The civil money penalty may be increased for a facility that has deficiencies, which, after imposition
of a lower level penalty amount remain uncorrected and, in fact, become sufficiently serious to pose immediate jeopardy.
The civil money penalty would be shifted to the lower range of penalty amounts for a facility which had immediate jeopardy
deficiencies if the immediate jeopardy is removed. However, if the noncompliance that continues after the immediate
jeopardy is removed constitutes repeated deficiencies in the same regulatory grouping of requirements, the civil
money penalty would be increased in accordance with &sect;488.438(d)(2) of this final rule. In a previous discussion,
we clarified the reasons why we will not be constrained by a specified timeframe to conduct on-site revisits or suspend
a penalty until we can revisit and the date when the penalty begins to accrue.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter suggested that at proposed &sect;488.230(i) we provide for the accrual of interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are revising redesignated &sect;488.440 to require that the notice of the penalty amount due include a statement
of the interest rate so that a provider is aware of the interest rate applicable if the penalty is not paid on the due date.
Redesignated &sect;488.442(c), which discusses the collection procedures for civil money penalties, specifies
how the rate of interest is computed. Redesignated &sect;488.442 Due date for payment of penalty.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters proposed changing the date when civil money penalties are due as stipulated at &sect;488.230(j)(1)
of the proposed rule to one of the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;30 days everywhere the proposed rule specifies 15 days, as 30 days is more commonly used in commerce;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;30 days from the date of notification or any earlier period as provided for by State law; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Within 10 days of receipt of notice of penalty or within 10 days of receipt of the final hearing decision unless
the decision is appealed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We do not accept the recommendations of the commenters to change the due date. The due date proposed (now in redesignated
&sect;488.442) is consistent with existing HCFA notification procedures in which we give the provider a 15 day notice
before a remedy begins, such as, in the case of the denial of payment for new admissions or termination in nonimmediate
jeopardy situations. Because we have no compelling reason to conclude that reducing the 15 days to 10 days or increasing
the 15 days to 30 days would result in a more effective enforcement process, we are not changing this policy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, while reviewing these comments, we realized that we did not include all of the provisions explaining when
the civil money penalty can be collected. Consequently, we are adding these provisions to redesignated &sect;488.442(a).

including appeals to the appropriate State or Federal court.

We do not accept this recommendation. We are revising redesignated &sect;488.442(a) to make clear that the civil
money penalty is collectible when a final administrative decision is issued upholding the imposition of the penalty.
This position is in accordance with the intent of section 1128A(e) of the Act, as stated in the conference agreement.
The conference agreement provides that no penalties will be assessed nor payment prohibited until all administrative
remedies have been exhausted. (See H.R. Rept. 97&hyph;208, 97 Cong., 1st Sess. Book 2 (Conference Report) p. 950.
(1981)).

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters supported the provision that allows the civil money penalty to be deducted from any sum then or later
owing to the facility by HCFA or the State. The commenters believe that this provision is time saving and cost effective.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters recommended only deducting the civil money penalty from any sum then or later owing by HCFA or the State
if the penalty payment is not received in full within 30 days from the date of notification. A commenter asked if HCFA
or the State will notify the facility when they plan to deduct the penalty from future monies that HCFA or the State owe
the facility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We appreciate the support of the commenters who agree that the amount of the penalty when determined, may be deducted
from any sum then or later that HCFA or the State owe to the facility as specified in redesignated &sect;488.442(b).
This provision implements section 1128A(f) of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments to only deduct the penalty if the facility has not paid in full within 30 days and the question about notifying
a facility of a deduction are concerns that will be addressed in forthcoming manual instructions. However, a facility
is not precluded from paying the civil money penalty, when it is collectible, at any time prior to the time when the penalty
would be deducted from sums then or later owing to the facility.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A commenter stated that HCFA and/or the State should collect the civil money penalty after all appeal rights are exhausted
because the ability to deduct a civil money penalty, when determined, from any sum then or later owing, is unfair and
could financially cripple the facility.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We do not accept the comment. First, a civil money penalty is not collectible until, as explained in a previous comment,
a final administrative decision is made that supports the imposition of the penalty. Second, a facility's financial
condition is one of the many factors considered in determining the amount of the penalty. It is not our intent to cause
a facility undue hardship; however, if the penalty imposed is in the upper limit of the immediate jeopardy range, we
believe it is justified, because residents are in life threatening situations and we want to motivate the facility
to immediately correct deficiencies. Finally, the Act permits that civil money penalties may be deducted from any
sum that HCFA or the State owes or will owe the facility, and since a provider has ample notice of the due date, the option
exists to pay the civil money penalty on or before the due date as opposed to the money being deducted from sums owed or
owing.

 Another commenter said more consistency between regulatory requirements and enforcement practice would be demonstrated
by requiring the agreement of the patient and his or her attending physician with the monetary penalty to be imposed
prior to the withholding of monies from the patient's funding source. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 To solicit the agreement of each and every resident and his or her attending physician before the imposition of a civil
money penalty would unnecessarily delay the imposition of the civil money penalty. Also, if a facility is not motivated
to promptly correct noncompliance, due to the lengthy delay created by seeking resident and physician approval,
the health and safety of residents could be compromised for an even longer period of time. Furthermore, when a provider
enters into an agreement with HCFA or the State, or both, to participate in the Medicare and/or Medicaid programs,
it is responsible for providing the agreed upon level of care to the residents. There is no justification for asking
each resident and his or her attending physician for permission to impose a civil money penalty since the resident
is the recipient and/or the beneficiary of the program and not a party to the agreement.

 Many commenters suggested that the rate of interest not be negotiable as stated in the proposed rule's preamble. The
commenters said this can promote inconsistency, is unworkable and inequitable. Commenters wanted to know how the
rate will be negotiated (as stated in the proposed preamble) and who will determine this rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters offered alternative language for this regulatory provision which included the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Interest accrues at the credit card rate from the date of citation on all penalties not paid prior to a request
for a hearing;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Interest is assessed at an annual rate which is 2 percent above the prime rate on the unpaid balance of the civil
money penalty beginning on the due date;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Interest accrues from the date of the violation at the highest rate permitted by State usury laws;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Interest is based on a national index (for example, 6-month Treasury bills); and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The interest rate must be placed in regulation.

 We agree that the interest rate should not be negotiable and we are revising redesignated &sect;488.442(c) to specify
the interest rate applicable to the collection of civil money penalties. For Medicare, the interest rate is the rate
fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury and used by the Department of Health and Human Services. The rule now states that
the interest rate is the higher of either_(1) the rate fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury after taking into consideration
private consumer rates of interest prevailing on the date of the notice of the penalty amount due (this rate is published
quarterly in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

 We received many comments on the collection of civil money penalties from dually participating facilities. A few
commenters were confused and asked for clarification of this regulatory provision. Commenters suggested amending
the language of the proposed rule, which says, ``the relative proportions of Medicare and Medicaid beds at the facility
actually in use'' by adding ``by residents covered by the respective programs *&blank;*&blank;*'' to this sentence.
Another commenter recommended the regulation say, ``the relative proportions of Medicare and Medicaid residents
in the facility at the time the facility receives notice of the imposition of the civil money penalty.''

 We are revising redesignated &sect;488.442(e) to include the phrase ``by residents covered by the respective programs
on the date the civil money penalty begins to accrue.'' By including this phrase, we require that civil money penalties
collected from dually participating facilities be apportioned to the Medicare and Medicaid programs, not according
to the proportionate number of beds but proportionate to the number of residents in each program on the date the civil
money penalty begins to accrue. For example, a facility has the capacity and is certified to provide care for 50 Medicare
beneficiaries and 50 Medicaid recipients. On the date the penalty begins to accrue, 15 Medicare beneficiaries and
45 Medicaid recipients are residing in the facility and 40 beds of the 100 beds are empty. The amount of the civil money
penalty is apportioned as follows: 25 percent (15/60) of the civil money penalty would be apportioned to the Medicare
Trust Fund for Medicare beneficiaries and 75 percent (45/60) of the civil money penalty would be applied to the protection
of the health and property of Medicaid residents of facilities that the State or HCFA finds deficient.

 Many commenters suggested alternative uses for the civil money penalties collected by HCFA or the State. Many suggested
using the civil money penalty amount to address the situation which led to the deficiency so as to protect the health

 We cannot accept the above suggestions for the disposition of a civil money penalty imposed in accordance with sections
1819(h)(2)(B)(ii), 1919(h)(3)(C)(ii) or 1919(h)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act. If the civil money penalty is used by the
facility to correct the noncompliance which led to its imposition, it is, in effect, not a remedy. While the use of the
civil money penalty to fund the State incentive program, to finance grants for needy facilities or to deposit into
the Long Term Care Monitor/Receiver Fund would be beneficial uses, the Congress has directed the use of the civil money
penalty amounts collected as specified in section 1128(A)(f) of the Act. Civil money penalties collected from Medicare
facilities are returned to the Medicare Trust Fund and, as specified at section 1919(h)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act and redesignated
&sect;488.442(e). Civil money penalties collected by the Medicaid State agency, in accordance with section 1919(h)(2)(A)(ii)
of the Act, are applied to the protection of the health or property of residents of nursing facilities that the State
or the Secretary finds deficient, including payment for the costs of relocation of residents to other facilities,
maintenance of operation of a facility pending correction of deficiencies or closure, and reimbursement of residents
for personal funds or property lost (redesignated &sect;488.442(f)). The law does not require that the money received
through civil money penalties be spent on direct patient care. In fact, the Act suggests that those funds will be spent
on administrative expenses, such as those incurred in moving patients to other facilities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 1919(h)(2)(A) of the Act specifies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that civil money penalties collected by the State be applied 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the protection of the health or property of residents of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nursing facilities that the State or Secretary finds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficient. We believe the Congress intended that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include the State reimbursement of a resident for personal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
property and funds lost at the facility as a result of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions by the facility or by individuals used by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility to provide services to residents. We are revising 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the rule accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We accept the suggestion to replace the word ``including'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the word ``such as'' in the paragraph that discusses the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of civil money penalties collected by the State. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revision does not alter the meaning of the provision, but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does provide needed clarity. The Act, as referenced above, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enumerates certain specified activities for which a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collected civil money penalty may be used; however, it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not an exhaustive list. As long as the intended use of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds may be said to relate to protecting resident health or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
property, it is not necessary that each use of the civil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
money penalty be expressly stated in the regulation. Using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the words ``such as'' more precisely conveys the intent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this provision and allows the State to have flexibility in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining what activities relate to protecting residents' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health or property.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A few commenters said that the regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision at proposed &sect;488.230(k) does not offer guidelines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on how civil money penalties may be settled and that there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is no control over the States' or Secretary's discretion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A consumer organization commented that granting States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete discretion to settle cases whenever and however 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they choose undermines the effectiveness of civil money 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalties. They added that this regulatory provision opens 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the door too wide for parties interested in not paying fines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to make inappropriate deals with decision-makers and avoid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility for their noncompliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters suggested deleting this regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision, and a few commenters specifically suggested that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section be deleted in accordance with their changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed at &sect;488.230(e) which provide for settlement in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which a facility pays the civil money penalty that was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposed (less the 35 percent), and corrects the deficiencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which led to the penalty, within 10 days of receipt of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice.

Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We cannot accept these comments. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority provided HCFA or the State to settle any case at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any time prior to a final administrative decision, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified at redesignated &sect;488.444, is consistent with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other regulatory provisions pertaining to civil money 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalties. Regarding the comment that this provision opens 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the door for decision makers to make deals with providers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we contend that the survey, certification and enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process is built on a system of integrity and implements the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary controls to assure that this integrity is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintained. To remove this provision, as suggested by a few 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters, would deny providers the opportunity to promptly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
settle their cases. We believe that the suggestion to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
settle by deducting 35 percent from the civil money penalty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if the deficiencies which led to the penalty are corrected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within 10 days does not allow a facility enough time to make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a decision regarding whether to waive or request a hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, the provision in redesignated &sect;488.436 deals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically with a provider waiving its right to a hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Redesignated &sect;488.444 provides the opportunity to settle a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
case, even if the hearing right was not previously waived. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This provision was incorporated into the regulation in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest of resolving disagreements at the stage in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process before sizeable expenditures of time and money are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
devoted to hearing procedures. Even if a hearing had been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested, if, before the proceeding, all parties can reach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement over the deficiencies to be corrected and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty to be paid until corrections are made, costly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearings procedures can be avoided.

 A commenter requested that press releases and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a notice to the long term care ombudsman accompany 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
settlement, and if the civil money penalty was imposed as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result of a complaint investigation, notice should be given 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the complainant.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We do not accept this comment. Sections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1819(g)(5) and 1919(g)(5) of the Act provide for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disclosure of information regarding inspections and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities of skilled nursing facilities and nursing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities. Survey and certification information, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
includes but is not limited to statements of deficiencies, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plans of correction and appeal results, is available to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public. The regulation at &sect;488.325 expands disclosure to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include among other things, notice of SNF or NF 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance and adverse action(s) imposed to the long term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
care ombudsman. Existing State survey agency procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require that a notice be sent to the complainant informing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
him or her of the disposition of the allegation. We 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintain that the present methods of disclosure used for all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance situations provide ample opportunity for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public awareness, and we do not believe that any additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefit is derived by having separate disclosure procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for those cases in which civil money penalties are used as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedy (see discussion for &sect;488.325 Disclosure of results 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of surveys and activities).

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A provider organization recommended that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issues that may be resolved at settlement include citation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a deficiency; severity and scope of the deficiency; the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedy imposed; exclusion of the deficiency as the basis for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased sanctions in the future; and exclusion of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiency or deficiencies cited on the HCFA Form-2567 as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the basis for further enforcement action by any other agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or office of the Department of Health and Human Services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(HHS).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We do not accept the suggestion to include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the regulation specific deficiency related issues that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be discussed at settlement. Providers have many 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunities to discuss and resolve the deficiency-related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issues raised by the commenter before the settlement of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
civil money penalty would occur. Providers have the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity to question survey findings during the survey, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the exit conference, while awaiting receipt of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
official deficiency statement, upon receipt of same, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through ongoing dialogue with the State and HCFA regional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offices. Also, all States must have a dispute resolution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process as required by &sect;488.331 of this rule to enable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providers to discuss perceived discrepancies in the survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process. While the existence of a deficiency may arise at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
settlement discussions, it is unnecessary to mention it or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any other of the above issues which are predicated on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existence of deficiencies and which may arise. Moreover, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have no authority, as the commenter suggests, to exclude a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiency in the present but increase the enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action if it is repeated in the future.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Virtually everyone who commented vehemently disagrees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with this proposed section. Consumer groups oppose this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section because, they believe, it forces HCFA or the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to terminate a facility's provider agreement rather than to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impose alternative remedies. State organizations disagree 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the provision that the State must agree to repay FFP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for Medicaid facilities rather than the facility agreeing to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repay (as stipulated for Medicare). Providers argue that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed rule is too strict, because repayment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal funding would begin the day that the State survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency identifies deficiencies rather than when HCFA or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State imposes remedies when facilities do not correct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies. Providers also believe that asking for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement to repay Federal funds for deficiencies at low 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scope and severity levels is harsh.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters believed that proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.232, as redesignated at &sect;488.450, will force States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to impose termination instead of alternative remedies for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all instances of noncompliance in NFs. They based their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
belief on the provision that says that, when the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey agency prefers an alternative remedy in lieu of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
termination, the State must agree to repay FFP. If the NF 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fails to correct the deficiencies during the correction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period, the State would be liable. These commenters said, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that because many States have no intention of entering into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an agreement to repay FFP, the State must start termination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that if the provision remains as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prerequisite to the use of alternative remedies, reliance on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
termination procedures will continue. In the commenter's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
view, the end result will be more litigation, because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providers will be placed in the unenviable position of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
having to respond to potential decertification for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relatively minor infractions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters criticized HCFA's proposed rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because it denies the intent of OBRA to make available to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States a range of remedies to be used as alternatives to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
termination for deficiencies of lesser severity and places 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NFs in the undesirable position of having to respond to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decertification actions for relatively minor violations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are aware of the difficulties posed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the repayment provisions of sections 1819(h)(2)(C) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1919(h)(3)(D) of the Act. As almost all commenters noted, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these requirements constitute a significant disincentive to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impose alternative remedies because the Act requires that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either the facility (under Medicare) or the State (under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid) repay the Federal government should the facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fail to correct identified deficiencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We note, however, that sections 1819(h)(2)(C) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1919(h)(3)(D) of the Act specify the rules that must apply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to SNFs and NFs when the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
only 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
course chosen to respond to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the violation of certification requirements is through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative remedies. We reach this conclusion because of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the literal language of both of the provisions of the Act, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which specifies that these remediation provisions apply when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State survey agency determines that it would be more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate to employ alternative means to assure compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than to seek a provider agreement termination. Thus, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters are quite right that when an alternative remedy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only is being sought, the repayment provisions of the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for SNFs and NFs are inescapable.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While we see the desirability of being able to pursue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only alternative remedies in many cases of facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance, the fact is that section 1919(h)(7) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act offers the availability of alternative remedies when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coupled with an action to terminate a provider agreement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when there would be no repayment consequences for either the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility or the State. In these cases, when HCFA agrees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the State's assessment that a provider agreement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
termination should be sought, the State's timing for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
termination controls. If the State opts for one or more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative remedies in addition to termination, those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies would be applied unless the Secretary chooses to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impose an alternative remedy. When both the State and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary choose to impose one or more alternative remedies, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1919(h)(7)(B)(ii) of the Act specifies that only the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary's remedies are imposed. As already discussed, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when the State's decision to terminate the provider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement as well as impose alternative remedies prevails, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we do not believe the rules of section 1919(h)(3)(D) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act would govern the imposition of the alternative remedy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, where a SNF's or NF's deficiencies do not pose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an immediate jeopardy to resident health or safety, HCFA or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State may opt for a ``slow-track'' termination and apply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one or more alternative remedies in the interim period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Should the facility achieve substantial compliance before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the effective date of the termination, as we would expect to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occur in almost every case, the termination action would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rescinded. Should the facility fail to correct deficiencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the effective date of the termination, the termination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would proceed, but neither the State nor the facility would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be liable to us for a repayment of funds for the time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following the identification of deficiencies. While we are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not suggesting that States or HCFA make a decision to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminate a provider agreement in all cases where facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies have been identified, we believe it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
important that States, and all others affected by these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions, be clear as to the consequences of using the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various provisions of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have concluded that the approach we have described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above can be applied to SNFs as well as to NFs and dually- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participating facilities. When we have identified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies for SNFs and seek provider agreement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
termination in accordance with section 1866(b) of the Act, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we would not be seeking only an alternative remedy. In such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cases, we believe the rules of section 1819(h)(2)(C) would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not apply since the State's recommendation is for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
termination and alternative remedies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe proceeding in the fashion we have described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relative to all nursing homes may strike the kind of balance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the Congress was seeking through its placing of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative remedies in greater prominence than had been the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
case before nursing home reform. Most importantly, nursing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
home residents would be protected, because the facilities in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which they reside would have every incentive to comply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quickly in order to have alternative remedies lifted. With 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that incentive, residents would face the unsatisfactory care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that gave rise to the enforcement action for only short 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
periods of time without facing the specter of relocating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were termination the first remedy of choice. Second, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States would have considerably more flexibility to impose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative remedies knowing that neither they nor the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility will be liable to us for the repayment of funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should a facility, in fact, fail to achieve substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance by the time that the termination action is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective. Of course, the mandatory denial of payment which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State or the Secretary is required to impose after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third month of noncompliance would not require the State for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid or the facility for Medicare to sign an agreement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to repay Federal funds if substantial compliance is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieved.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter believed that the continuation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of payments pending remediation provision should only be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applied in situations where the Secretary and the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disagree about whether to terminate and the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that termination should occur but the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that the facility can correct the problems. The

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This interpretation flows very logically from the wording of section 1919(h)(3)(D), which gives the Secretary permission
to continue payments (``The Secretary 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
may 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
continue payments *&blank;*&blank;*'' emphasis added). Since the Secretary has ample authority elsewhere in the
Act to pay facilities, he does not need this ``permission'' and therefore the provision would appear to be redundant.
It acquires meaning only if it is understood as making an exception to a situation where the Secretary would otherwise
be barred from making payment.

One commenter believes that sections 1919(h)(3)(D) and1819(h)(2)(D) of the Act, if not redundant, were incorporated
into the Act to constitute guidance in a situation that otherwise would make it unclear as to whether or not payment
should continue, that is, disagreement between HCFA and the State.

Other commenters noted that, ``A reasonable reading of the statute does not require the Secretary to second-guess
every determination by a State that intermediate sanctions should be attempted before resorting to termination.''
The commenters assert that the statutory provision should only apply in those very rare circumstances where the Secretary
concludes that termination is necessary, but yields to the State's recommendation that intermediate remedies be
imposed instead.

While we agree that the Secretary has the authority to pay Medicare facilities and pay States for Medicaid facilities
in accordance with sections 1861(v)(1) and 1903 of the Act, respectively, the provisions of sections 1819(h)(2)(C)
and 1919(h)(3)(D) limit the Secretary's authority to make payments for Medicare providers and States (for Medicaid
providers), respectively. However, that is not the only situation in which there would be lack of clarity as to whether
or not payment should continue. The clearer reading and the one we have adopted is that, without this provision, a lack
of clarity would exist over whether or not payments should continue despite noncompliance with the statutory participation
requirements. Further, we do not agree that the Act provides for the scheme offered by the commenter (that is, that
we only invoke section 1919(h)(3)(D) of the Act if there is disagreement about termination). Such disagreements
between the State and the Secretary over termination and establishing remedies are addressed at section 1919(h)(7)
of the Act.

One commenter expressed the opinion that there is almost universal agreement that terminating nursing homes from
Medicare and Medicaid is harmful to residents. The commenter believed that in most terminations, residents are transferred
to other substandard nursing homes farther away from family and friends. The end result of most provider terminations
is to expose residents to relocation trauma without getting better care. Other commenters also expressed concern
over the resident's reaction to a potential termination. Commenters believed that even when a facility has come into
compliance, residents suffer from the uncertainty of their situations. Although commenters agreed with our statement
in the preamble that we see provider agreement terminations generally to be the enforcement response to the most serious
deficiencies, they believed the proposed regulation allows almost unrestricted use of termination as a sanction.

We disagree with the commenter, who gave no evidence to support the contention that most provider terminations expose
residents to relocation trauma without getting better care. We acknowledge that there are instances in which termination
will cause some hardship to residents, but the advantages of removing residents from a noncompliant nursing home
could outweigh any disadvantages. Usually, HCFA and the State will impose alternative remedies prior to terminating
or in addition to terminating a facility in hopes that a facility will achieve substantial compliance. We believe
that in those cases in which termination becomes necessary, the termination is for the ultimate benefit of the residents
to assure that they receive the care to which they are entitled.

Many commenters believed that the proposed rule was so broadly worded that it could be understood to apply to every
situation where the extra time and the intermediate sanctions did not produce compliance. These commenters asked
that we revise the regulation to use the continuation of payment during remediation provision in only in the most egregious
situations where the Secretary disagrees with the State survey agency regarding termination.

Sections 1819(h)(2)(C) and 1919(h)(3)(D) of the Act do not provide any flexibility about the seriousness of a deficiency
in applying the continuation of payment during remediation provision. Indeed because the statute in both places
makes reference to the payment limitations being triggered if a facility is ``not in compliance with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 requirement of subsections (b), (c), or (d)'' (emphasis added), we believe that the Congress was focusing on any deficiency
that might cause a facility to not be in substantial compliance, not just cases of egregious noncompliance. Therefore,
we cannot accept the commenter's request.

One commenter recommended that we add the following sentence at the end of proposed &sect;488.232(a)(1)(i): ``In
considering whether it is more appropriate to impose alternative remedies than to terminate the facility, the State
shall take into account the relative effects on the facility's residents of relocation and remaining in the facility,
including the availability of suitable alternative placements for them.''

We are not adopting this recommendation because there may be instances when termination is necessary despite the
fact that it will cause some hardship to residents. As noted earlier, usually, HCFA and the State will impose alternative
remedies prior to terminating a facility; however, there may be instances where this is not possible. For example,
a facility could refuse to allow access to the surveyors, or could refuse to submit a plan of correction. A facility
might also remain out of substantial compliance with requirements after an up to 6-month period allowed for correction,
at which time the Act would require termination despite hardships to the residents.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters urged us to delete the provision at paragraph (a)(2) that HCFA or the State may terminate the SNF
or NF agreement before the end of a 6-month correction period if the criteria in paragraph (a)(1) of this section are
not met. Commenters believed that the Act does not authorize HCFA or the State to terminate a provider agreement if
a facility does not meet the threshold criteria (that is, the State survey agency finds that it is more appropriate
to impose an alternative remedy than to terminate the facility; the State has submitted a plan and timetable for correction
approved by HCFA; and the facility, in the case of a Medicare SNF, or the State, in the case of a Medicaid NF, agrees to
repay the Federal government payments received if corrective action is not taken in accordance with the approved
plan of correction). Commenters believed that once a determination is made to invoke the continuation of payment
provision, a facility should not be terminated or have its Federal funding discontinued unless it is found on a subsequent
survey to present immediate jeopardy, or the 6 months expire and the originally cited deficiencies have not been corrected.
On the other hand, a few commenters recommended that we change the section to read ``HCFA or the State must terminate''
rather than ``may terminate'' as it was proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We disagree with these commenters. First, on its face, the statute does not limit the authority of the Secretary to
deny further payments to facilities or States under these provisions to only those cases where deficiencies pose
immediate jeopardy. Rather, the statute speaks to all providers which do not meet ``a'' requirement of the Act. Second,
the States and the Secretary have plenary authority to terminate provider agreements any time there is facility noncompliance,
and sections 1819(h)(2)(C) and 1919(h)(3)((D) pose no limitation on that authority. If the State survey agency does
not prefer an alternative remedy in lieu of termination to remedy noncompliance, the Act compels the Secretary to
cease payments to the facility under Medicare or the State under Medicaid. If the State survey agency prefers an alternative
remedy in lieu of termination and the other two criteria are not met, the Secretary does not have authority to continue
payments under either program. However, if the State survey agency prefers termination, we cannot preclude a State
from imposing additional remedies while the termination is pending, which can be up to six months from the last day
of the survey. Therefore, we are not accepting the commenter's suggestion that we should continue Federal funding
unless we found on a subsequent survey that deficiencies present immediate jeopardy, or the 6 months have expired
and the facility has not corrected the originally cited deficiencies. To do so would be clearly inconsistent with
the Act, as we have discussed above. Neither immediate jeopardy nor a full 6 months of noncompliance have to have occurred
in order for the State or HCFA to terminate a provider agreement.

Many commenters suggested that we delete the

requirement that States submit the plan of correction to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA for approval in every case for which alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies are to be imposed. Some commenters assert that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this provision, as written, provides strong incentives to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using termination rather than alternative remedies. They 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
point out that if a State survey agency wants to impose any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedy other than termination, it must submit a plan of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correction to HCFA. The commenters believed that this will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
encourage States to terminate a provider agreement rather 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than to impose an alternative remedy because the requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that HCFA approve plans of correction under the continuation

of payment provision will be administratively burdensome.

The requirement that State survey agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submit a plan of correction to HCFA as part of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuation of payment provision is statutory. Sections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1819(h)(2)(C) and 1919(h)(3)(D) of the Act provide that,

``the State has submitted a plan and timetable for corrective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action to the Secretary for approval and the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approves the plan of corrective action.'' We do not have the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority to delegate this function to the State. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we may, through manual instruction provide for a mechanism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whereby, if the State survey agency has not received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval or disapproval from HCFA within a prescribed amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of time, we would deem the plan and timetable for corrective

action approved.

One commenter believed that the Secretary

should require States to seek HCFA approval for all plans of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correction involving use of alternative remedies only if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review will be done for the purpose of determining whether

the State has chosen its remedy strategically to achieve the

Sections 1819(h)(2)(C)(ii) and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approve all plans of corrective action. Moreover, the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not delve into the purpose behind approving the plans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of corrective action (that is only reviewing the plan of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correction to determine whether the State imposed the best 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedy for a given situation of noncompliance.) Adding such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a requirement to the regulation would inappropriately limit

accepting this suggestion.

One commenter believed that alternatives to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
termination should be allowed to be imposed because, without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a distinction between level and type of deficiency, even 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minor noncompliance becomes grounds for withholding of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We assume the commenter means that HCFA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should not use the continuation of payment provision for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minor noncompliance. As we have explained before, the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
makes no such distinction for minor deficiencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, we have no basis to revise the rule. If the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter is urging the use of remedies instead of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
termination, we believe that the enforcement scheme we have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed and in &sect;488.408, which correlates specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcement responses to specific levels of noncompliance, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides for incrementally more severe remedies for more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
serious deficiencies. Also, as discussed elsewhere in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule, while all facility noncompliance will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified, the enforcement response can range from a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provider's commitment to correct with no remedies imposed, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to termination of the provider agreement. Providers found 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be in substantial compliance will not have remedies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposed.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The majority of commenters who responded to this section asked that we take out paragraph (a)(1)(iii), which requires
that States repay Federal funds paid to a nursing facility when alternative remedies are used. One organization stated
that they believe HCFA is basing the regulation on a specific statutory requirement but they believe that this issue
should be discussed before implementation of its provision in the enforcement rules. They said that they believe
that a stronger public policy rests on the use of the alternative remedies and that a facility's failure to comply should
not create a financial threat to the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 First, we must point out that the repayment provision in redesignated &sect;488.450(a)(1)(iii) is based on the Act
and pertains to facilities, in the case of Medicare SNFs, as well as to the State, for NFs, that are not in substantial
compliance. Second, we recognize that the statutory requirement for State agreement to repay FFP for NFs if facilities
do not achieve substantial compliance can be a barrier for a State survey agency choosing to impose an alternative
remedy in lieu of termination. We understand the commenters' concern that many States will not agree to repay because
a NF's achievement of substantial compliance is not wholly within the State's control. We have been studying the repayment
issue and hope to develop a legislative proposal to remedy the inherent barriers in the Act. Absent a legislative change,
we cannot eliminate the requirement that States agree to repay Federal funds in accordance with section 1919(h)(3)(D)
of the Act. Neither do we have the authority to delay the implementation of this provision without legislative intervention.
However, the Act does not prevent States from obtaining a repayment agreement from a facility. The State could obtain
the facility's repayment agreement either before or after it enters into a repayment agreement with the Secretary.
Nor does the Act require that repayment of Federal funds be made if a facility is not in compliance with Federal requirements.
If the facility does not take corrective action in accordance with its approved plan and timetable and is not in substantial
compliance at the end of the correction period, the facility (for Medicare) or the State (for Medicaid) would be responsible
for repaying Federal payments for the correction period and HCFA would stop any further payment to the facility (for
Medicare) or the State (for Medicaid) for nursing home services. If the facility followed its approved plan and timetable,
but was not able to achieve substantial compliance at the end of the correction period, the facility or State would
not be responsible for repayment of Federal funds, but HCFA would stop further payment to the facility or State for
nursing home services. If a facility does not take action in accordance with its approved plan or correction and timetable,
but is able to achieve substantial compliance, the facility or State would not be responsible for repaying Federal
funds for the correction period, and the facility could continue in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Section 1919(h)(3)(D)
of the Act provide that the State agrees to repay ``if corrective action is not taken in accordance with the approved
plan and timetable'' that was approved by the Secretary. Furthermore, we have explained above that alternative remedies
can be imposed in addition to termination, and in such cases they would not be subject to the requirements of section
1919(h)(3)(D) of the Act.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters urged HCFA to delay the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement for the State to indemnify HCFA for FFP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repayment until day 90 if a facility is not in compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the requirements. Some commenters believed that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule eliminates any incentive for State survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies to recommend alternative remedies by imposing a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement to indemnify HCFA for FFP from day one. Others 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wanted to modify the regulations so that States would not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to guarantee repayment until day 90. One commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believed that such a policy would be consistent with the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and would ensure that facilities have the opportunity to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make corrections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 1819(h)(2)(C) and 1919(h)(3)(D) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act specify that the Secretary may continue payments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over a period of not longer than 6 months after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective date of the findings. To read ``the effective date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the findings'' to mean the 90th day would extend the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correction period from up to six months and up to nine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
months. Moreover, it would greatly distort the intent and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clear meaning of the phrase ``effective date of the findings'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to designate the 90th day after the findings were first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cited as the effective date. Therefore, the period covered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the sections 1819(h)(3)(C) and 1919(h)(3)(D) of the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is a maximum of six months, starting with the last day of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the survey. Sections 1819(h)(3)(C)(iii) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1919(h)(3)(D)(iii) of the Act provides that the facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(for Medicare) and the State (for Medicaid) agree to repay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Federal government payments received under these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subparagraphs if the corrective action is not taken in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with the approved plan and time period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, if the facility or the State must agree to repay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
money received for the period covered by section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1819(h)(3)(C) or 1919(h)(3)(D), they must agree to repay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
money received since the last day of the survey. Therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when the State or a facility enters into a repayment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement and the facility does not take action in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with its approved plan and timetable for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrective action or does not achieve substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance, the State or facility would be held financially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accountable for the period covered by the repayment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also disagree with the commenter's assertion that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the repayment period should not start until the 90th day in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order to give facilities more time to correct deficiencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The facility is notified of its deficiencies during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey, at the exit conference and then formally through the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Statement of Deficiencies shortly after the completion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the survey. We believe that the beginning of the repayment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period is irrelevant to the correction period. The facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has up to 6 months to take corrective action in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with its approved plan and timetable for corrective action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or achieve substantial compliance, or both. If the facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not meet that goal, the State or the facility will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected to pay back the Federal funding for the period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
covered by the repayment agreement.

Many commenters recommended that we delete 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
redesignated &sect;488.450(a)(1)(iii). Their comments included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;It is unrealistic that a State will agree to repay the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal government payments received if corrective action is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not taken in accordance with a facility's plan of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correction; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The language does not fit within the concept of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcement as envisioned in the Act; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;This provision is a heavy disincentive to use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intermediate remedies; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A State should not be monetarily penalized for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility's failure to comply with regulations when an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative remedy is chosen over termination; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;To put the State at risk for something that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ultimately out of the State's control does not make for good 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public policy; and

&bull;The provision is beyond statutory authority and should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be left to the States as to whether or not they wish to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recover reimbursement from the facilities for noncompliant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters asked that we amend this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsection to explicitly permit States to enter into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreements with facilities to repay Medicaid funds if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies are not corrected according to the approved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan of correction. Other commenters suggested that we only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hold a State liable for repayment of Federal Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments to a noncompliant facility if the facility remains 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
out of compliance and the State has not made full use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available intermediate remedies. One commenter wanted us to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
broaden the rule used for Medicare (that is, that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility agree to repay) to apply to Medicaid as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Absent a legislative change, we have limited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
choices when a State survey agency finds a facility out of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial compliance with Federal requirements and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative remedies only are the recommended enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
response. For Medicare, we must obtain an agreement to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repay from the facility or cease making payment to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility. For Medicaid, we either obtain a repayment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement from the State or stop Federal financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation to the State for that facility. In addition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State may terminate a NF. In response to the commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who worried about the State's liability for up to six months 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of FFP, the Act does not prevent States from securing an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement to repay from the facility before agreeing to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repay monies to the Federal government. In fact, during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transition period between when the new nursing home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements became effective and the effective date of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final survey process and enforcement rules, some States have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtained agreements to repay from facilities before signing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreements to repay to HCFA. However, we will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
explicitly include in regulation that States are permitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to enter into repayment agreements with facilities, nor will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we broaden the rule for Medicare to apply to Medicaid. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State has the discretion to determine whether repayment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreements between it and the Medicaid facilities would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beneficial. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also are not accepting the recommendation to only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hold a State liable for the repayment of Federal funds if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State had not made full use of available alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies. Accepting this recommendation would limit the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary's ability to implement the provisions of section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1919(h)(3)(D) of the Act.

One commenter suggested that we replace ``of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the determination of noncompliance by'' with ``that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility's provider agreement is terminated by'' at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.432(b).

Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amended language suggested by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter substantially alters the meaning of this section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and, if accepted, would be contrary to the Act. Sections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1819(h)(2)(C) and 1919(h)(3)(D) of the Act permit the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary to continue payments pending remediation if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State, for Medicaid, and the facility, for Medicare, meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain criteria. If the State agency prefers alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies rather than termination and the criteria of section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1819(h)(2)(C) and 1919(h)(3)(D) of the Act are not met, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary has no authority to make any payments to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility from the ``effective date of the findings,'' that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is, from the last day of the survey that found the facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was not in substantial compliance with the requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1819 (b), (c) or (d) or 1919 (b), (c) or (d) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act, or both. If termination of a facility's provider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement is sought, payments continue until the effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date of termination, which may not be more than 6 months 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after the last day of the survey. Substituting ``that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility's provider agreement is terminated by'' would permit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more payments to the State or the facility than the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allows. In fact, such a policy would be no different than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pre-existing policies to stop Federal payments on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective date of termination. For these reasons, we have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not accepted this comment.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter pointed out that &sect;488.432(c) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allows continuation of payments for up to 6 months from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
last day of survey. The commenter further stated that if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA intends that the government can decide to give a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility less than 6 months of continued payments, HCFA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should specify clear criteria in the regulations to guide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this decision. Because the proposed regulations do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contain any such criteria, the commenter suggests that we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delete the words ``up to.''

We are not accepting the commenter's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggestion, and we have not specified criteria as to when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA or the State would allow continued payments for less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 6 months. We do not want to in any way restrict HCFA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or the State's ability to decide, on a case-by-case basis, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the optimal amount of time for continuation of payment for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular facility.

 One commenter stated the Act does not require that a facility correct all deficiencies; rather, the Act requires that
a facility must have taken corrective action in accordance with the approved plan and timetable.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 While we believe that a provider must be in substantial compliance by the end of the allotted correction period to avoid
a loss of Federal payments or termination, we agree with the commenter that our language could be more precise and are
revising &sect;488.450(d) to delete the section title ``Deficiencies not corrected'' and renaming it ``Action
not taken in accordance with approved plan and timetable for corrective action.''

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters wanted to expand the period for providing notice of payment cutoff under the six month rule from
15 to 60 days. Commenters asserted that 15 days is insufficient time for the facility to correct any remaining problems
and obtain a follow-up survey. They contend it is even less sufficient if the facility disputes the continued existence
of the deficiencies and desires a hearing on the matter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are not expanding the notice period from 15 days to 60 days nor do we agree that the 15-day notice period is inadequate.
We base the 15-day notice period prior to termination on our experience with &sect;489.53(c)(1), which sets forth
notice requirements for other providers and suppliers. Moreover, the purpose of the notice is not for a facility to
make last minute corrections, but for the government to help fulfill its duty to provide due process to facilities
before termination. Facilities generally have had notice of their noncompliance long before the 15 days prior to
termination.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter recommended that, unless HCFA is the only party acting (that is, the State does not terminate Medicaid
participation), the State should provide the hearing and final decision. The commenter believed that if HCFA subsequently
disagrees with the State's decision, the facility should not be affected. HCFA's action would be against the State
alone, for recoupment of Federal financial participation, and should be appealed through the normal Departmental
Appeals Board (DAB) process.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We assume this commenter is referring to a NF. When a NF's provider agreement is terminated, the appeal procedures
which apply depend on who is taking the enforcement action. If the State is terminating a NF and the Secretary is taking
no action, the appeal procedures at 42 CFR part 431 apply. If the Secretary exercises her authority, finds noncompliance,
and terminates the NF, the appeal procedures at 42 CFR part 498 apply. If a NF is a State-operated entity, the Secretary
always takes the enforcement action, and the appeal procedures at 42 CFR part 498 would apply. In the case of facilities
which participate as a NF and a SNF (dually participating facilities), where both the State and the Secretary are making
enforcement decisions on the Medicaid and Medicare agreements respectively, the appeal procedures at 42 CFR part
498 apply. Since nearly 80% of all nursing homes are dually participating, the majority of NFs will appeal their enforcement
actions through the Federal appeal procedures at 42 CFR part 498. The appeals mechanism for providers adversely affected
by the repayment provision would be the same as an appeal of noncompliance which led to termination or other enforcement
remedies, except that a State can also appeal the recoupment of FFP under a DAB hearing in accordance with 45 CFR part
16. The recoupment of Federal funds will be one of the results of the termination; however, the noncompliance which
led to termination remains the initial determination which is at issue at the hearing, and is the action on which the
recoupment of funds is predicated.

Many commenters were not aware that most of the provisions in this section are required by the Act. Most of the comments
we received concerned proposed &sect;488.234 as a whole; therefore, we have grouped the comments under generic headings,
rather than under specific subsections. HCFA's Role in Enforcement Decisions.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations reflect the statutory role given to the Secretary by the Congress in the enforcement provisions of
the Act. Specifically, sections 1919(h) (5), (6), and (7) require the Secretary's involvement in enforcement decisions
with respect to Medicaid NFs should the Secretary find facility noncompliance and seek to impose either alternative
sanctions or termination or both.

Several commenters stated that the Congress did not intend HCFA to make all compliance decisions on dually certified
SNF/NFs.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HCFA does not make ``all the decisions'' on a dually certified SNF/NF. The Act itself prescribes that a finding of noncompliance,
by either the State or the Secretary, will prevail over the other agency's finding of compliance. Therefore, the Congress
decided that in cases where the agencies disagree, the finding of noncompliance becomes the effective finding regardless
of whether it is the Secretary or the State that has made the finding. In addition, the Act provides that a State's decision
to terminate prevails over HCFA's decision not to terminate, and the State's timing of a termination also prevails
over HCFA's.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We have no intention of second guessing the results of every State survey. Sections 1819(g)(3) and 1919(g)(3) of the
Act, however, require the Secretary to conduct validation surveys of a representative sample of SNFs and NFs in each
State within 2 months of surveys by the State survey agency. Section 1919(h)(3)(B) of the Act provides for the Secretary's
general validation authority exclusive of actual on-site validation surveys. As we stated in the proposed rule,
prior to the effective date of OBRA '87, HCFA, acting for the Secretary, monitored State surveys. OBRA '87 formalized
this process. The Congress also made explicit provision for whose enforcement approach would prevail in the case
of a disagreement between the State and HCFA. Sections 1919(h) (6) and (7) of the Act, as implemented by redesignated
&sect;488.452, specify situations in which the State rather than the Federal government prevails, with regard to
the choice of a remedy or the timing of an enforcement action.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few commenters stated that HCFA should take enforcement action against a Medicaid provider only after a validation
survey or other on-site survey. Some wanted to change the above regulation by inserting the phrase: ``on the basis
of a validation survey'' after ``HCFA finds.'' Some commenters wanted a State's enforcement decision to be the controlling
decision because the States understand local conditions better than HCFA does.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are not adopting these proposals to act only on the basis of an on-site validation survey, because they would limit
HCFA's oversight responsibility and limit HCFA's ability to protect residents' health, safety and rights. Federal
surveyors are able to review a State-prepared Statement of Deficiencies and come to an independent conclusion about
whether the deficiencies cited indicate substantial compliance or noncompliance with the statutory and regulatory
requirements. This has been a routine part of HCFA's monitoring of State survey agencies in the past. We do not think
the Congress intended to reduce these monitoring responsibilities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter noted that under &sect;488.452, if a State and HCFA have a difference of opinion on the deficiencies
cited, the one that finds noncompliance prevails. The commenter wondered how an administrator of the facility could
understand how to comply, if the State and HCFA could not agree on compliance/noncompliance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Act mandates that the finding of noncompliance prevails over the finding of compliance. All facility administrators
can read the Act, the regulations and the detailed guidelines that have been issued to implement the regulations.
We believe that facilities have a duty to operate in compliance at all times, regardless of whether the State and Secretary
agree that a noncompliance exists. Disagreements between the State and Secretary could be a result of different findings
between Federal and State surveys from different observations at different times, and not necessarily a disagreement
about the same set of facts. The surveys could occur 2 months apart, for example, during which time conditions at the
facility could change.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter stated that &sect;488.452(d)(1) appears to pose double jeopardy for nursing facilities in that compounded
remedies may be applied by both HCFA and the State agency. The commenter did not think that providers should have to
face corrective action from both agencies. Another commenter noted that in case of a Federal survey following a State
survey, two different remedies could apply; for example a State could terminate an agreement and the Secretary could
impose additional civil monetary penalties. The commenter stated that the one-time Federal survey could not consistently
or fairly evaluate the facility, and double sanctions from both agencies would not improve quality of care. The commenter
suggested that only one type of sanction be applied ``after'' the Federal and State surveyors concur on the findings.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 1919(h)(7) of the Act, specifically envisions cases where a facility may face remedies at the hands of both
a State and HCFA. Section 1919(h)(7)(B) of the Act expressly sets forth the rules as to whose remedies will apply when
either or both parties are seeking to impose alternative sanctions in addition to a provider agreement termination.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We do not accept the implication that one-time Federal surveys cannot fairly evaluate a facility. Federal surveyors
are trained, just as State surveyors are, in the requirements of the Act and the regulations. Federal surveyors have
always conducted Federal monitoring surveys to monitor State survey agency performance; therefore these, statutory
requirements formalize long-standing agency practice.

 One commenter stated that the net effect of the regulations is that facilities will be assumed to be out of compliance.
This commenter stated that historically, facilities were deemed to be in compliance unless there were allegations
to the contrary, and that if Federal and State surveyors disagreed, another survey should be required.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We do not agree that another survey should be conducted whenever there is disagreement between Federal and State surveyors.
Whatever the commenter may think of the wisdom of the Act's ``tie-breaker'' rule, the Congress has been quite clear
in directing which survey decision applies when HCFA and the State disagree about compliance and remedies. We also
do not agree that facilities will be assumed to be out of compliance. Facilities are required to meet all the requirements
at all times. When a facility signs a provider agreement, the facility is agreeing to maintain compliance. The surveyors'
job is to verify that compliance. If either a Federal or State survey finds the facility to be out of compliance with
program requirements, deference must be given to that certification of noncompliance in the interest of the protection
of resident health and safety.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters stated that the proposed regulations allow almost unrestricted use of terminations and do not
promote the use of intermediate sanctions. They wanted HCFA to revise the proposed rules to encourage and promote
the use of intermediate sanctions rather than terminations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters said that intermediate sanctions enable States and HCFA to promote correction of deficiencies with
incentives and pressures different from those imposed by termination or the threat of termination. They enable the
State and HCFA to move quickly against facilities with deficiencies and to target their enforcement actions to the
nature, character, and extent of the deficiencies. They quoted House Report No. 100&hyph;391(I) at 451&hyph;452,
470&hyph;497, as reprinted in 4 U.S. Code and Cong. &amp; Ad. News, 100th Cong. 1st Sess. at 2313&hyph;271 through
2313&hyph;272, 2313&hyph;290 through 2313&hyph;296; IOM at Chapter 5 (pp. 146&hyph;170); General Accounting
Office, ``Medicare and Medicaid Requirements: Stronger Enforcement of Nursing Home Requirements Needed'' (July
1987).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some stated that the regulations place roadblocks to the use of intermediate sanctions. They commented that &sect;488.456
allows termination if a facility fails to submit a plan of correction, or fails to comply with a plan of correction.
They also noted that &sect;488.406 describes other remedies as being ``in addition to termination of the provider
agreement.'' They stated that this wording makes it appear as if termination is the preferred or most common remedy.
They were also concerned that &sect;&sect;488.410 and 488.415 make termination mandatory if a facility refuses
the appointment of a temporary manager, despite the fact that temporary management ``is not an optional remedy under
the reform law.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These commenters were concerned that nursing home residents would be subjected to harm because of actual or threatened
terminations of their nursing homes. They stated that language in the preamble, indicating that terminations were
an enforcement response of last resort, was not reflected in the language of the regulations themselves.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters recommended that the regulations prohibit use of termination as a remedy, except in those circumstances
required under OBRA '87 or when alternative remedies have failed and the condition of the building is unsafe. They
wanted State regulators to find ways to use alternative remedies to protect residents, rather than making them homeless,
or subjecting them to the trauma of threatened termination, stating that ``If the building is safe but care is bad,
the operator should be evicted rather than the residents. Used properly, alternative remedies can be used to force
a substandard provider to sell the facility.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We agree that the use of alternative remedies should be encouraged. However, if a facility chooses not to submit a plan
of correction, neither HCFA nor the State survey agency has any means to determine how the facility intends to improve
conditions of inadequate care and, therefore, no clear picture for how residents will be protected. In such a case,
failure to terminate the provider agreement would be irresponsible on the part of HCFA or the State. However, if the
facility fails to comply with a plan of correction but achieves substantial compliance, we would not terminate the
facility's provider agreement. Allowing a nursing home to participate with deficiencies and with a plan of correction
represents a certain degree of risk. The nursing home's lack of success in making corrections could indicate that
the risk to the residents has not dissipated. Moreover, facilities that had a civil money penalty imposed could face
an increase in their penalty because the noncompliance was uncorrected. The responsible exercise of certification
duties requires that residents be protected, even if termination is necessary to achieve that protection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We disagree that temporary management ``is not an optional remedy.'' It is the State's or HCFA's decision as to whether
or not to impose temporary management, whether in immediate jeopardy or non-immediate jeopardy situations. In the
former cases, there is a choice between temporary management and immediate termination. If temporary management
is not imposed, either because HCFA or the State considers that action inappropriate or because the facility refuses
to relinquish management control to the temporary manager, the Act requires that the facility's provider agreement
be terminated. We have no authority to ignore this explicit statutory requirement. In the latter cases, temporary
management is an optional remedy when facilities are found to have widespread actual harm.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We note that we have no authority to evict non-complying officers or staff of the provider, as the commenter suggests,
or to force the sale of substandard facilities.

It is our intent that both HCFA and the State apply remedies tailored to fit specific problems. We have developed an
enforcement model which correlates categories of remedies to the seriousness of noncompliance. However, with approximately
16,000 nursing homes in the United States, it is impossible to specify in regulations precise remedies to fit every
particular problem in facilities. The seriousness of the noncompliance dictate the category of minimum enforcement
action to be taken. The exact choice of a remedy or remedies from that category should be based on an evaluation of the
nature of the situation in a particular nursing home and the course of action most likely to precipitate the rapid correction
of the noncompliance.

``Pay Back Provisions''

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters proposed interpreting the ``pay back'' provisions in section 1919(h)(3)(D) of the Act as applying
only to those rare situations in which the Secretary concludes that termination is necessary, but yields to the State's
recommendation that intermediate sanctions be imposed instead. In situations in which the Secretary does yield
to the State, that action could properly be contingent on the State's promise to repay Federal funds if the intermediate
sanctions do not succeed in bringing the facility into compliance. These commenters wanted HCFA to add language giving
guidance to the States on the corrective action plans mentioned in the Act.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We believe that the Congress intended to give facilities the chance to come into substantial compliance during a period
when only limited, alternative remedies are imposed, but that in return for this grace period, during which Federal
money is expended on noncompliant facilities, the facilities (and the State) must agree to repay the Federal money
if substantial compliance is not achieved. Because of the procedural specificity of preparing corrective action
plans, we have decided to incorporate such guidance in manual instructions.

Several commenters suggested that the State be designated the primary enforcement agency, with authority to select
and carry out remedies prior to HCFA review. They feared that enforcement would be delayed if the survey agency only
recommended to HCFA, and waited for HCFA's determination on what remedies to apply. Several commenters suggested
that we delete the requirement that State survey agencies submit the plan of correction along with suggested intermediate
sanctions, to HCFA for approval prior to imposing the intermediate sanctions.

The Act is quite clear in its division of responsibilities between the States and the Federal government when it comes
to the enforcement of Federal certification requirements. Under the Medicare program, the State has no authority
to impose remedies as the commenter suggests. Section 1819(h) of the Act reserves all enforcement decisions to the
Secretary and permits States to make recommendations only on the basis of the surveys they do under their section 1864
agreements with the Secretary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Medicaid program, however, we agree with the commenter that in most cases it is the States in the first instance
that are responsible for enforcement decisions affecting providers of services. In either case, we believe we have
designed an enforcement model that will place a premium on swift action once noncompliance is identified by either
the State or the Secretary, and we do not anticipate delay in the implementation of decisions.

A few commenters wanted to add provisions that would require HCFA and the State to consider the availability of other
nursing home beds, when a termination action is considered. They wanted HCFA and the State to consider the relative
effects on the facility's residents of relocation compared to remaining in the facility.

We are not adopting this recommendation because we believe that there may be instances in which termination is necessary
despite the fact that it may cause hardship to residents. Usually, HCFA and the State will impose alternative remedies
prior to terminating a facility, including a mandatory denial of payment for new admissions remedy imposed at the
3rd month; however, there may be instances when this is not possible. For example, a facility could refuse to allow
access to the surveyors, or could refuse to submit a plan of correction. A facility might also remain out of substantial
compliance with requirements after a 6-month period of correction, at which time the Act would no longer authorize
continued payment, despite hardships to the residents. We believe that in those cases in which termination becomes
necessary, the termination is for the ultimate benefit of the residents to assure that they receive the care to which
they are entitled.

The enforcement scheme delineated at &sect;488.408, Selection of Remedies, is a model that States must adopt. States
have the authority granted them under section 1919(h)(2)(A) of the Act to specify their own criteria as to when and
how to apply each of the remedies provided by the Act. Moreover, States are authorized to develop alternative remedies,
in accordance with section 1919(h)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act, and we encourage them to do so.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the proposed rule, we said that alternative remedies would continue until HCFA or the State determines that the
facility has corrected all deficiencies, until HCFA or the State terminates the provider agreement, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 until HCFA discontinues FFP. This statement included a typographical error (``and'' was used instead of ``or'')
that changed the meaning of the statement. We meant to say that alternative remedies would continue until HCFA or the
State determines that the facility has corrected all deficiencies, until HCFA or the State terminates the provider
agreement, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
or
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 until HCFA discontinues FFP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters expressed concern over when deficiencies are considered to be corrected: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;One said that it is not clear whether compliance is considered achieved when procedures for alleviating the
problem are in place, or when the actual problem no longer exists. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;One said that once the facility has notified HCFA that a deficiency has been corrected, penalties should be
suspended immediately until the survey team is able to return to the facility to alleviate a possible financial burden
on the facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Another said that the State should be required to do a follow-up within a specified period of time, and, if it
fails to do so, the remedy should be lifted automatically. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters said that the duration of alternative remedies should be linked solely to the deficiencies
that led to their imposition, not to the correction of all deficiencies. They said that consideration should be given
for significant progress and substantial compliance, suggesting that remedies should be lifted as soon as the facility
corrects all deficiencies that led to the imposition of the remedy. One commenter suggested that even if a deficiency
remains uncorrected, the remedy should be lifted if the scope and severity combination is brought down to a level that
does not authorize the remedy.

Sections 1819(h)(3) and 1919(h)(4) of the Act specifically state that the denial of payment sanction ends when HCFA
or the State determines that the facility is in ``substantial compliance'' with program requirements. In this final
rule, we are extending this principle to all other alternative remedies as well. The determination that the facility
is in substantial compliance may be made either through a survey team's revisit, or, through some other review, if
HCFA or the State, based on credible evidence which can be verified without an on-site visit, determines that at least
substantial compliance has been achieved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the Act, at sections 1819(h)(2)(E) and 1919(h)(2)(D), and at sections 1819(h)(2)(B) and 1919(h)(2)(A)(iii)
provides for certain additional qualifications as to when remedies are lifted, and we are incorporating them in the
regulation as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;In the case of temporary management, and in the cases of denial of payment and State monitoring imposed because
of repeated substandard quality of care, the remedy continues in effect until the facility has demonstrated, to the
satisfaction of the State or HCFA, that it is in substantial compliance, and that it is capable of remaining in substantial
compliance. (See &sect;488.414) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, with respect to the duration of all other remedies, we state in this final regulation they remain in effect
until_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A revisit confirms that the facility has achieved substantial compliance; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The date HCFA or the State, based on credible written evidence which can be verified without an on-site visit,
determines that the facility has achieved substantial compliance; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;HCFA or the State terminates the provider agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with &sect;488.430(i)(7), if a facility can show that substantial compliance was achieved on a date
earlier than a revisit by a survey team or before the State or HCFA receives or examines acceptable credible evidence,
the remedies cease to apply as of that date.

 The Congress enacted the various types of alternative sanctions that appear at sections 1819(h) and 1919(h) of the
Act with the expectation that they would be used. Drawing from the IoM study on nursing homes, which criticized the
large numbers of facilities that fluctuated between compliance and noncompliance, the Act is designed to impose
alternative sanctions swiftly once noncompliance is identified as a means of spurring facilities to correct deficiencies
more rapidly than might otherwise be the case. While this may prove costly to those facilities that find themselves
subject to such sanctions, this is a cost that the Congress obviously anticipated and concluded was necessary to assure
high quality care for program beneficiaries.

 Several commenters argued that the proposed regulations rely too heavily upon termination as a remedy. These commenters
feel that termination should be used as a last resort and only where other remedies have failed or where the building
is unsafe. In addition, some of these commenters want to consider the effect of termination on residents (transfer
trauma) and a few of them go further to recommend that the regulations prohibit the use of termination unless immediate
jeopardy to residents is present and only after everything else has failed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One of the main goals of the proposed enforcement regulations was to increase the number of remedies available to HCFA
and the States in order to ensure compliance with the health and safety requirements. We believe that implementation
of these final regulations will accomplish that goal. While we will encourage the use of alternative sanctions, we
firmly believe that provider agreement terminations may be appropriate in certain cases of noncompliance whether
or not deficiencies pose immediate jeopardy to residents. We, too, are concerned about the potential harm to residents
when they are required to move from a facility. For this reason, the regulations are designed to provide HCFA and the
State survey agency with the ability to target noncompliance with appropriate remedies to assure compliance with
the least disruption to residents and the facility. We cannot, however, restrict the use of termination to immediate
jeopardy situations. Sections 1819(a)(3) and 1919(a)(3) of the Act require that a facility meet all of the statutory
participation requirements to be considered a SNF or a NF, respectively (in other words, participate in either Medicare
or Medicaid). While we have explained elsewhere why it is justifiable to consider substantial compliance as acceptable,
the Act does not limit the above provisions by allowing indefinite noncompliance in non-immediate jeopardy situations.
Indeed, sections 1819(h)(2)(C) and 1919(h)(3)(D) of the Act only permit continuation of Federal payments to facilities
with non-immediate jeopardy deficiencies for a maximum of 6 months, and then only if certain criteria are met. Continuation
of payment after 6 months is only permissible if substantial compliance has been achieved. Further, section 1919(h)(7)(A)(i)
reinforces the 6 months maximum for participation for a noncompliant SNF.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter recommended that HCFA create a conditional waiver, not to exceed two years, that would apply to all physical
environment requirements. The commenter recognized that no period of correction may exceed the 6-month limitation
but pointed out that it may be physically impossible to correct structural deficiencies within that timeframe. Such
correction may necessitate applications for bank loans and certificate of need approval; moreover, the construction
season is limited by geographical location. The commenter believed that creation of conditional waiver not to exceed
two years, for physical environment requirements, would allow facilities to continue to participate legitimately
while correcting problems that the facility cannot correct within the 6-month period.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We agree that some physical environment deficiencies may take longer to correct than others and that these deficiencies
may not be wholly corrected within 6 months of the last day of the survey. However, as we have discussed previously,
facilities must meet the standard of ``substantial compliance'' in order to continue participation in the Medicare
and Medicaid programs. To meet the standard of ``substantial compliance'', deficiencies must be such that they cause
no harm or potential for more than minimal harm. Although we have no desire to terminate facilities that are otherwise
providing good quality of care, we believe that facilities have had ample time to comply with these requirements.
Physical environment requirements have been in place since October 1990. Moreover, this regulation will not become
effective until 6 months after the first day of the month after the regulation is published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A few commenters stated that the termination notice period of 2 days was inadequate to allow a fair opportunity for
elimination of jeopardy. These commenters and others mentioned that the 2-day notice period was inconsistent with
the 23-day termination process outlined at &sect;488.410. One commenter proposed a termination notice of 60 days
for cases not involving immediate jeopardy. The same commenter said the time period should start when the facility
receives notice of the remedies being proposed. One commenter asked how the public was to be notified of a termination
action and another felt a notice should be posted on the front door of the facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are not accepting these comments, although we believe that there may be some misunderstanding among commenters
as to the workings of the fast track termination cycle and the notice provisions applicable to facilities facing adverse
action. In describing these procedures in the proposed rule, we were stressing the paramount significance of protecting
resident health or safety in cases where immediate jeopardy is identified during the survey process. In such cases,
the overriding concern is the removal of the threat either through immediate correction by the facility or by the transfer
of residents to other more qualified facilities following the termination of the deficient facility's provider
agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We continue to believe that the 2-day prior notice provision of the proposed rule is necessary to protect these resident
interests and we are retaining it for this reason in this final rule. Past experience with this notice provision in
the case of Medicare SNFs has demonstrated to us that it is effective. Having said this, however, we want to dispel those
fears about this provision that in all cases a provider will never have more than 2 days' notice before having its provider
agreement terminated. As described in the proposed rule, we will have in place a 23-day termination cycle in immediate
jeopardy cases. This time frame spans the maximum period of time between the last day of the survey that identified
immediate jeopardy and the effective date of the termination. Thus, in many cases, providers, which will have been
advised of the survey findings during the survey or at the exit conference, will often have ample time to remove the
conditions that gave rise to the immediate jeopardy finding. The prior notice must be given early enough so that the
termination date does not extend beyond the 23-day period should the facility fail to remove the immediate jeopardy.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Facilities facing adverse action in these cases will not be guaranteed the maximum amount of time provided by these
regulations. For those facilities whose substandard conditions warrant the quickest possible response, it is entirely
possible that the effective date of the termination action will occur sooner than the 23rd day after the survey; and
it is these facilities that will likely receive notice of the impending action against them as quickly as administratively
feasible following the survey. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Extensive experience has demonstrated that it is possible to schedule revisits in a short time frame to verify that
the immediate jeopardy has been removed. Because of our experience that the 23-day process works, we will continue
to start the clock on the last day of the survey to ensure that jeopardy situations do not remain long uncorrected. We
see no justification for facilities to receive additional time to correct instances of immediate jeopardy. In the
same vein, we will continue to give a 15-day notice to the public and the facility in non- immediate jeopardy cases,
and a maximum of 6 months from the last day of the survey to reach substantial compliance before termination is effective.
A 15-day notice in nonimmediate jeopardy cases is a well established practice for all provider types. For both immediate
jeopardy and non-immediate jeopardy situations, the public will be notified of terminations by a variety of means;
in most instances, this will be accomplished by a newspaper notice, as is the predominant present practice. We believe
that a public notice posted on the front door of the facility would be an unnecessary affront to the facility when Federal
requirements stipulate that the survey results be made available to residents for examination in a place readily
accessible to residents and a notice of their availability must be posted (see &sect;483.10(g)).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A few commenters felt that termination should not be applied if deficiencies were corrected within the delineated
timeframes. One commenter said that the timeframe for termination should be no shorter than 6 months in cases that
do not constitute immediate jeopardy. One commenter suggested that the regulation require an ``acceptable plan
of correction'' from the facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current practice and the final regulations assure that termination will not be applied if noncompliance has been
corrected within the designated timeframes. Redesignated &sect;488.456(b)(1) states that the facility's provider
agreement may be terminated if the facility_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Is not in substantial compliance with the requirements of participation; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Fails to submit a plan of correction with the time specified by HCFA or the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 488.456(b)(2) states that HCFA and the State will terminate a facility's provider agreement if a facility_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Fails to relinquish control to the temporary manager, if that remedy is imposed by HCFA or the State; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Does not meet the eligibility criteria for continuation of payment as set forth in &sect;488.412(a)(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the Act does not mandate an automatic 6 month period for the correction of all deficiencies; 6 months is the
outside limit permitted for correction of deficiencies that constitute noncompliance and then only when specific
statutory criteria are met. The States and HCFA must have the flexibility to choose appropriate remedies, including
termination, and timeframes appropriate to the noncompliance identified. We agree with the suggestion to revise
redesignated &sect;488.456(b)(1)(ii) to read ``an acceptable plan of correction.'' This change is in line with
our current practice.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A few commenters were concerned that the proposed regulations were unreasonable and that HCFA and the States should
have an objective, measurable mechanism to govern the enforcement procedures. Another commenter felt the new regulations
would inflate termination actions tenfold and increase the State agency workload. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We do not agree with these comments. These regulations are designed to encourage the selection of a particular remedy
based on the nature of the noncompliance and the likelihood of immediate and sustained compliance. It was the intent
of the Act that the availability of additional remedies will mean that HCFA and the States will use termination as a
remedy less frequently. The use of these regulations for the selection of remedies will help ensure that the selection
of remedies is consistent and appropriate. We expect that these new regulations will not cause greater expenditures
for the State agencies. However, as we said in the proposed rule, a reallocation of resources, particularly geared
to more intensive monitoring of marginal facilities may well occur.

 One commenter recommended amending the regulations to permit the survey agency to initiate termination actions
based upon poor compliance history. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act provides the States and HCFA with the authority to terminate facilities with poor compliance histories. Specifically,
sections 1819(h)(2)(C) and 1919(h)(3)(D) of the Act provide for State and Federal discretion as to whether or not
termination is preferable to the imposition of alternative remedies in the case of noncompliance that constitutes
non-immediate jeopardy. We expect that a facility's previous history will be a significant factor in the determination
of whether termination or an alternative remedy is preferred. However, poor history in and of itself can not warrant
termination if the noncompliance has not persisted. That is, if the provider has indicated poor performance in the
past but is in compliance in the present, there would be no basis for termination.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After considering comments we received on proposed &sect;488.226 and &sect;488.240, we have decided to combine
both sections in a new &sect;488.426. We believe this change will be less confusing as transfers for all nursing homes
can be referenced in one place.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter asked the following questions: If a facility is terminated, who will be responsible for placing the
residents elsewhere? If no bed is available, who will pay for the residents' care in the facility until a bed is found?
The commenter stated that the State should have the responsibilities regarding transfer and discharge (in other
words, tour of the new facility, counseling, orientation to the new facility, etc.), to avoid transfer trauma.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Proposed &sect;488.240, now incorporated into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.426, stated that the State must arrange for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
orderly transfer of residents when a facility is closed or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its provider agreement is terminated. Further protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for residents is available in regulation. Section 489.55 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides that payment is available for up to 30 days after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the effective date of termination for eligible residents and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;441.11(a)(2) states that, in the case of continuation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FFP for Medicaid, the Medicaid agency must make reasonable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efforts to transfer recipients to other facilities. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation clearly gives the responsibility for orderly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transfer of residents to the State. Each case involving the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transfer of residents could potentially be different. We 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are, therefore, leaving it up to the State to decide, on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
case-by-case basis, what steps need to be taken to reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the risk of transfer trauma, understanding that the State's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility is to minimize the period of time during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which residents are receiving less than adequate care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter stated that a finding of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediate jeopardy will result in the facility's emergency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closure and transfer of the residents. This commenter asked 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where residents would be transferred if a county or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular area had too few available beds? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The finding of immediate jeopardy will not, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in and of itself, require States to close a facility and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transfer Medicare and Medicaid residents. In an emergency, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State could transfer Medicare and Medicaid residents to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
another facility or facilities. There could be situations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such as an earthquake or other natural disaster, where the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State would temporarily transfer residents to another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility until the facility can adequately care for its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residents. In this case, the facility did nothing wrong. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, in the case of immediate jeopardy, the facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failed to protect the health or safety of its residents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For immediate jeopardy situations, the statute at sections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1819(h)(4) and 1919(h)(5) of the Act provides for immediate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
termination if the jeopardy is not removed, but it does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require the State to close the facility. However, when a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility is terminated for immediate jeopardy, the State has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
up to 30 days to transfer the facility's Medicare and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid residents. Most States have a relocation plan that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outlines the circumstances under which the plan will be put 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into effect and the procedures to be followed. These plans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
usually provide for first attempting to place residents in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the closest facility or facilities and then attempting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
placement at increasingly distant facilities until available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beds are found. We believe it is unnecessary to mandate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures for States to follow in cases of closure or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transfer of residents, and that no greater procedural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specificity is required in regulations.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter expressed concern that after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coming to a nursing home with the expectation of living out 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the rest of one's life there, a resident may be forced to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
move to another location because of some technicality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Termination and closure of a facility are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
among several remedies available to protect the health and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety of Medicare and Medicaid residents. Although it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible that a noncompliant facility could be terminated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for not submitting to a plan of correction, as is required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for continuing participation in the Medicare or Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program, it is not likely. Most nursing homes are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interested in participating in the Medicare and Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs and will not risk termination based on such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters requested that we place 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more requirements upon the States to assist residents, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should a facility lose its Medicare or Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification. Two of the commenters, representing consumer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organizations, believe proposed &sect;488.240 is inadequate in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terms of requirement specificity, and they provided a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete and detailed rewrite of the section. Their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experience with closures and decertifications in the last 5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years has led them to believe that providers and regulators 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cannot be trusted to provide a ``safe and orderly'' transfer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process. As a result, their rewrite focuses on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendation that HCFA mandate the States to develop plans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that provide requirements for the ``safe and orderly'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transfer of all residents when the State closes a facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Included in the rewrite are provisions that outline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific residents' rights in the transfer process such as, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining the location of the transfer, availability of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
counseling and support, and the transferring of residents' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possessions and trust funds. The commenters also address 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for the new admitting facility, as well as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for the coordination among appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies, organizations and ombudsmen involved in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transfer process.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To ensure proper development and execution of the plan, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the commenters recommend that we require the State to submit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its transfer plan to HCFA for approval. HCFA, in turn, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should assess performance under the transfer plan annually, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the review of the State's enforcement performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters end their rewrite of proposed &sect;488.240 with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an enforcement recommendation that if the State's transfer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan is found inadequate, HCFA should take actions as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in proposed &sect;488.243 (b) and (c). They also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommend that immediate implementation of the plan be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waived during a crisis or disaster which makes it impossible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to fully implement a State's transfer plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the detailed rewrite of the section, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters recommend that the term ``all residents'' be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined, because the amount of assistance residents receive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the transfer process is directly related to their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid, Medicare, or private payment status. For example, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid residents receive services such as notice of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closing, information about care options, counseling, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transportation, and other types of relocation assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare residents are often not offered any of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services, and private pay residents usually receive no help 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whatsoever. One commenter suggested that it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inappropriate to ``require'' the transfer of residents if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility has not been delicensed by the State and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residents choose to remain at the facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, one of the commenters states that the preamble 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the text of the proposed regulation differ as to which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency has the responsibility for transferring residents, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the preamble stating that the State agency must arrange 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for transfer, proposed &sect;488.240 stating that the State has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the responsibility, and &sect;441.11(a)(2) stating that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid agency does.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We believe the commenters inadvertently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transposed proposed section numbers &sect;488.234 (b) and (c) as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there are no proposed sections &sect;488.243 (b) and (c). We 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appreciate these very thorough and specific comments and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of effort that went into them. Although there are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
valid considerations in the suggested rewrite of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section, some of them may be impossible for the States to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement. We, therefore, choose not to impose such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stringent requirements on the States. Existing regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at &sect;483.12(a) provide numerous procedural safeguards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding the transfer and discharge of residents. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, the States are already required by sections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1819(h)(4) and 1919(h)(5) of the Act to provide for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
orderly transfer of residents when a facility is terminated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or closed, and at sections 1819(c)(2) and 1919(c)(2) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act, to provide notice of transfer at least 30 days in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advance in most cases. We agree that proposed &sect;488.240, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
now incorporated into &sect;488.426, which uses the words ``all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residents,'' may be overly broad and we are revising that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section to specify that only Medicare and Medicaid residents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are affected by this section. We accept the suggestion that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the term ``orderly transfer'' be amended to ``safe and orderly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transfer'' to maintain consistency with the language of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sections 1819(h)(4) and 1919(h)(5) of the Act. Since 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sections 1819(h)(4) and 1919(h)(5) address immediate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jeopardy terminations, we cannot accept the comment that it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is appropriate to allow any Medicare or Medicaid residents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to remain in a facility that is being terminated for such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
serious situations. To do so, would put these residents in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jeopardy and would be clearly contrary to sections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1819(h)(4) and 1919(h)(5) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following addresses what one of the commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perceives as conflicting information regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility for the orderly transfer of residents. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preamble did indeed state that the survey agency is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsible for arranging for transfers, while proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.240 (now incorporated into &sect;488.426) is taken 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directly from sections 1819(h) and 1919(h) of the Act and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
places the responsibility generally on the State. We wish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to give the States the greatest latitude in determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which State agencies they will use. Therefore, it is our 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intent to rely on the broader interpretation in proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.240 and place the responsibility on the State as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by the Act. Although the commenter has correctly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pointed out that &sect;441.11(a)(2) places the responsibility on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Medicaid agency, we believe that each State should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
given the flexibility to select the appropriate agency under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its particular governmental structure. Therefore, we are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revising &sect;441.11(a)(2) accordingly.

 This commenter stated that, in the past, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility for arranging for the orderly transfer of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residents to another facility whenever a provider agreement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is terminated has been placed on the facility operator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to the State's oversight. This commenter stated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the proposed regulations would impose substantial costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and uncertain legal liabilities upon the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 According to existing regulations at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;483.12(a), the State, not the facility, has had the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility in the past for numerous procedural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safeguards regarding the transfer and discharge of residents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and has funded such costs. Sometimes the facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooperate in the transfer of residents and sometimes they do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not. Sometimes they have no resources with which to help. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the ultimate responsibility for all aspects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relative to transfer of residents in the case of a facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closure lies with the State to ensure that the well-being of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residents is protected.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Another commenter agreed with the regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
text but wanted us to require, in the case of provider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement termination, that the State permit a resident to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remain in a terminated facility provided the resident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arranges to pay for his or her care and the facility does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not close. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 It is not necessary to require States to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allow residents to remain in terminated facilities because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they already have that right. If a resident prefers to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remain in a terminated facility that is still operating, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is able to pay for his or her own care, that resident has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
every right to do so. The government has fulfilled its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obligation by providing notice to residents that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility's provider agreement has been terminated. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applies whether or not immediate jeopardy exists. The State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is the only entity that has the authority to close or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delicense a facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter suggested that if residents are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transferred because a facility is terminated, we should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require that the State provide for such transfer, at its own 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expense, and that it be held liable for its action during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such action.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We already require the State to transfer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare and Medicaid residents to another facility or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities in immediate jeopardy terminations. In fact, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid residents, the State is paid up to 30 days of FFP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the safe and orderly transfer to another facility or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities after termination. We have not accepted the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment that the State be held liable for its action during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such transfer. A State's liability should come under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purview of State law. We have no statutory basis to hold 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States liable for such actions. Therefore, we have not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included this provision in the regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter, representing a State Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Aging, stated that the language in the proposed rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding transfer of residents is inadequate and provided a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
list of minimum requirements for States. The twelve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements listed have all been covered by the preceding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters except for the following two instances. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter recommends that a facility that is being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminated be monitored daily and also recommends that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ongoing counseling for residents include follow-up post- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transfer counseling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Although the suggestion that facilities in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the process of being terminated be monitored daily is well- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intentioned, the specifics of transfer plans are under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purview of the States. We are not mandating that the States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
take specific action other than that already required and it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is unlikely they could implement this suggestion given the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uncertainty of how long the process will take and how much 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funding they will have available. Regarding the suggestion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that follow-up post-transfer counseling be provided to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residents, again it is the State that determines which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services are provided for transfer of residents.

Informal Dispute Resolution (&sect;488.331) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the preamble to the proposed rule, we specifically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asked for public comment about the desirability and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
feasibility of establishing a formal conflict resolution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process whereby providers dissatisfied with survey findings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could request a review of the deficiencies after the survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and prior to the formal administrative and judicial review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processes. We also acknowledged the existence of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numerous informal opportunities providers currently have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
throughout the survey process to challenge survey findings: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the survey, at the exit conference, while awaiting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receipt of the official deficiency statement, through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dialogue with State and regional officials, and upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receiving the official deficiency statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``conflict'' resolution has been changed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``dispute'' resolution in this final rule to be consistent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with terminology used in the Administrative Dispute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Resolution Act (ADRA) of 1990 and Executive Order 12778, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which encourage such a process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters believe that a dispute resolution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process is necessary. A few do not. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The majority of commenters in favor of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dispute resolution process contend that there is currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no means for providers to resolve conflicts with survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
findings short of costly litigation. Most say that they are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either not afforded the informal opportunities to resolve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conflicts to which we referred in the preamble to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule, or that the outcome of those opportunities is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
predetermined and, therefore, of little value. Also, many 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cite the ADRA of 1990 and Executive Order 12778 which (they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claim) direct Federal agencies to develop dispute resolution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mechanisms in an effort to reduce costly and lengthy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
litigation. A few commenters believe such a process could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also serve as a means to measure surveyor quality assurance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The majority of comments supporting a process suggested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that HCFA mandate an informal dispute resolution process, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
while less than one-third preferred that HCFA mandate a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formal one. Several commenters suggested that HCFA adopt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the current dispute resolution process of a specific State, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for example, Ohio or Louisiana. These commenters contend 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that existing programs in specific States have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
successful in resolving conflicts about survey findings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Others suggested that HCFA require that each State establish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a State-specific process, in order to give States the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flexibility to work within their existing administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
framework. Commenters proposed that since most States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
already have some type of dispute resolution process, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need only to require that it be formalized; in other words, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in written form and publicly recognized. Commenters also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested that HCFA establish one process to be used by all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States. These comments were presumably based on the belief 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a single process mandated by HCFA is the most effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
means to ensure that consistent opportunities are offered in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a consistent manner to all nursing home providers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dissatisfied with survey findings. The proposals we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received for a single process varied in extent and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sophistication and included suggestions that the dispute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resolution process: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Offer resolution opportunities at specific times during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the survey (for example, conduct daily exit conferences or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
communicate at the time a deficiency is identified), and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cease offering opportunities beyond specific events (for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, after the exit conference or after the issuance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the deficiency statement); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Provide multi-tiered opportunities that could include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring of corrections and mandatory revisits; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

&bull;Be limited to deficiencies at specific scope and

severity levels; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Offer opportunities proportionate to the noncompliance; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Allow incorrectly cited deficiencies and scope and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Require that another survey be conducted by different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveyors; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Establish local or national advisory councils, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arbitration panels, or quality assurance committees, etc., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comprised of specific types of individuals not previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directly involved in the dispute; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Involve consumers and ombudsmen. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conversely, other commenters did not believe that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dispute resolution process is necessary. They said that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providers already have numerous opportunities to refute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey findings throughout the survey process. Some alleged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that an additional process would only serve to delay the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcement process which would be contrary to the OBRA '87 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandate to minimize the time between the identification of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violations and final imposition of enforcement remedies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some also believed that if such a process were in place, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies may not be cited or, at a minimum, they would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be cited at lower scope and severity scale levels to reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the universe for challenges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One consumer organization argued that the regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system is not a two-party system in which the facilities and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State negotiate. Rather, it is a contractual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arrangement in which the State holds the public's trust and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acts as the public's agent to ensure that the contractees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfy the arrangement. They believed that if any party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should have ``appeal'' rights, it is the residents who should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be able to contest survey findings that do not require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities to comply with the law. They submitted, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore, that instead of establishing a dispute resolution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process for providers, HCFA should build mechanisms into the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey procedures to notify residents, families, ombudsmen 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and others when surveyors, during the course of the survey, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have not yet been able to substantiate suspected problems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These procedures would provide an opportunity for residents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and families to provide additional information to surveyors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter, opposed to a dispute resolution process, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remarked that there is currently so much interaction between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveyors and providers during the survey process that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providers are actually interfering with the performance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the survey. This commenter suggested that a sanction be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposed against providers when this occurs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Overall, most commenters, including States, offered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strong support for a dispute resolution process. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters were interested in resolving conflicts as early 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the survey process as possible and prior to litigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
They prefer to minimize the number of issues that could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advance to formal litigation by resolving early those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conflicts caused by misunderstandings, miscommunication, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oversights, etc. However, the consumer advocacy groups were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adamant in their opposition, arguing that any additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process will delay the enforcement process against 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncompliant facilities and shift focus away from resident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
care. These commenters believe that the perceived need by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providers for a dispute resolution process must be secondary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the responsibility HCFA, the States, and facilities have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to provide for the health and well-being of nursing home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residents.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: We recognize the validity of both major 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
points of view and have concluded that both perspectives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be addressed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Fall of 1992, we asked the States to provide us 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with a description of existing dispute resolution processes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offered to providers who disagree with survey findings. All 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States responded. Washington, DC, Puerto Rico, and Guam 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were not asked to provide their comments due to the small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of facilities surveyed. We discovered that all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States currently have a dispute resolution process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nevada's system of due process is required by State law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other States' processes, although not legally mandated, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are reflective of State policy and not legislation. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policies vary among States, and there are numerous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
differences in the details of the processes of individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Overall, the opportunities offered to providers by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States to challenge survey findings can be divided into two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basic stages: during and after the survey. All States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offer the providers a chance for rebuttal during at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one of these stages; half of the States include both in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process. During the survey, the opportunities afforded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providers include the chance for the provider's staff to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interact with the survey team throughout the process and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific opportunity to discuss survey findings at the exit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conference. After the survey, many States allow the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providers to elevate unresolved issues to survey agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management and/or the HCFA regional office for resolution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, providers in all States may record their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disagreement with survey findings on the Statement of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deficiencies HCFA&hyph;2567. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Our State Operations Manual currently requires that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States allow facilities to interact with the survey team 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the survey, to discuss findings at an exit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conference, to raise unresolved issues to the survey agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and/or to the HCFA regional office and to record their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disagreements with survey findings on the HCFA&hyph;2567.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As we reviewed all of the comments supporting a dispute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resolution process, it became apparent that, while the words 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``informal'' and ``formal'' were used to distinguish the type of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process a specific commenter preferred, many commenters, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regardless of which word was used, preferred the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process. The majority of those in favor of a dispute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resolution process have asked that it be required by HCFA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since many believe that a process can be required only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through rulemaking, most commenters, therefore, prefer a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We note that the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 1990 and the Executive Order 12778 of October 23, 1991, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Civil Justice Reform (56 FR 55195), encourage, but do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
direct dispute resolution, as some commenters have claimed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are not accepting those comments proposing that we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopt a specific State's process on a national level, nor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those suggesting that each State be permitted to design its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
own process in its entirety. While we have concluded that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all States offer some opportunity to resolve disputes, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have no evidence that suggests that any particular State's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process is more successful or effective than that of another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, we are accepting, with modification, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggestion that HCFA adopt one process to be used by all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States. Just as participation requirements and the survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and certification process for nursing homes are consistent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from State to State, so should the opportunity for providers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to challenge survey findings. In &sect;488.331, we are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requiring several core elements that all informal dispute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resolution processes must include as a minimum: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The entity conducting the survey must offer nursing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
home providers the opportunity, if they request it, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refute survey findings beginning with their receipt of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
official HCFA&hyph;2567 with which they disagree; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Providers must be able to advance their disagreements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to survey agency or HCFA regional office officials, or both; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In no case, will dispute resolution delay the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective date of an enforcement action; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The dispute resolution process (whether or not it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeds the minimum requirements specified in this final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule) must be available to providers, upon their request, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
written form. HCFA regional offices provide dispute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resolution to providers upon request, relative to Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveys. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe that specific procedural requirements that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine the manner in which dispute resolution proceeds, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for example, such things as how the request is made, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method by which the process is conducted, and who may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate in the process, should be left to the individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States. Upon the facility's request, the State will provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a written summary of that State's procedures relative to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
informal dispute resolution process. Any attempt on our 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part to codify procedural aspects of dispute resolution that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be applicable to all States would limit States' as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
well as providers' flexibility in utilizing and refining the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process, as necessary, to satisfy their needs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To allay commenters' fears that dispute resolution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would stall the survey process and delay enforcement action, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we are providing in &sect;488.331 the opportunity for providers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to dispute survey findings upon receipt of the official 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA&hyph;2567 with which they disagree, while prohibiting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
challenges by providers from postponing or otherwise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delaying the enforcement process. In no case will dispute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resolution delay the effective date of an enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action. Thus, while it is our hope that dispute resolution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures could be completed in all cases before the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective date of the enforcement action, we wish to make it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clear that where the completion of these procedures does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occur by that time, this will not be grounds to either delay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the enforcement action or give providers a right to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
challenge the inadequacy of these procedures. We believe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that to have a process that would allow for enforcement to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be deferred pending the scheduling and completion of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
informal appeals process is far outweighed by the needs of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residents to face a minimum of time during which they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receive care that does not meet the requisite health and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety standards. We also believe that not delaying the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective date of the enforcement action until the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conclusion of the dispute resolution process will encourage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities to make the kind of swift corrections the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress obviously intended when it enacted nursing home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reform. If a provider is subsequently successful, during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the dispute resolution process, at demonstrating that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies should not have been cited, the deficiencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are removed from the HCFA&hyph;2567 and any enforcement actions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that had been imposed as a result of those cited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies are lifted.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This dispute resolution system does not introduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional requirements into the survey process; rather, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reinforces instructions that already exist but which have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been applied inconsistently up to this point. Because we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are formalizing this element of the appeals process, we are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amending the appeals procedures at 42 CFR parts 431 and 498 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to eliminate the reconsideration process for SNFs and NFs, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respectively. Informal dispute resolution will duplicate, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in every pertinent way, this element of the process since it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will provide the opportunity for providers to contest survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
findings informally just as reconsiderations currently are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed to do. Accordingly, we have concluded that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retaining the reconsideration process for SNFs and NFs would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
create redundant procedures and are amending it so that it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applies only to other provider and supplier types. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the comment to use dispute resolution as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
means to measure surveyor consistency, accuracy, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision-making, section 1819(g)(2)(D) of the Act requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary and the States, and section 1919(g)(2)(D) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act requires that States, implement programs to measure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and reduce inconsistency in the application of survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results among surveyors. HCFA and the States will develop 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their own mechanisms to satisfy this requirement and may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
choose to use the dispute resolution process as a means to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluate surveyor performance in this area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We do not agree with some commenters' characterization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of dispute resolution as negotiation between providers and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the survey agency, nor do we agree that a process should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established to notify residents and their families when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveyors require additional information in identifying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies. First, dispute resolution as required in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule does not contemplate bargaining between providers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the survey agency; rather, it is a preliminary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity for providers to refute survey findings that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they believe are inaccurate and to present evidence to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
support their belief. The purpose of this informal process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is to clarify, if not eliminate, the issues that might 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
otherwise lead to needless litigation and to sharpen the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issues for an administrative law judge or State hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
official so that litigation, should it occur, may be less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burdensome and costly. This may work in two ways. It may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
convince the State or HCFA officials that erroneous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies have been cited, or it may convince providers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that, because the State and HCFA have ample support for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their conclusions, it would be unwise for providers to pursue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
litigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, States enter into an agreement with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary (HCFA), in accordance with section 1864 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act, to act as HCFA's agent for the purpose, (among others), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of determining if a facility meets participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. After following the survey protocol, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
includes interviews with residents, and family members or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legal representatives, surveyors may find that they do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have sufficient information to cite a deficiency. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we note that whenever nursing home residents or their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
families believe that a deficient or otherwise inappropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practice exists in the facility, regardless of whether a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey is in process, they should contact the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ombudsman, request a complaint investigation, or both. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters believe that a dispute resolution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mechanism may impact on how surveyors recognize deficiencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as well as how they assign scope and severity scale levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to cited deficiencies. First, it is important that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters be absolutely clear that neither the enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scheme presented in the proposed rule nor the modified model 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in this final rule was developed for the purpose of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identifying deficiencies. Rather, the assessment factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussed under ``Factors to be Considered in Selecting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Remedies'' of this preamble and codified at &sect;488.404 of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule will be used (as the former scope and severity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scale was to be used) to evaluate the seriousness of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies already identified in order to determine what, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if any, enforcement action is appropriate. Second, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
response to public comment, this final rule has incorporated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the concept of substantial compliance. This concept, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is discussed in detail under ``Certification of Compliance'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this preamble, provides that not all deficiencies will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result in enforcement action and should, therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eliminate resistance or hesitation of surveyors to cite 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies that they have identified for fear of provider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disputes of lower-level assessment determinations. As we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have stated elsewhere in this preamble, the survey process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides several opportunities for deficient practices or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
otherwise inadequate performance on the part of the State to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be identified and sanctioned. Therefore, if the situation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described by the commenters should occur, there are adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statutory and regulatory mechanisms to respond to it.

We do not accept the comment that we should sanction a

believe that this situation is adequately addressed in

section 2713 of the State Operations Manual, which provides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that surveyors may allow, or refuse to allow, facility

personnel to accompany them during a survey. Each case is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the surveyors' discretion and is to be worked out with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility management. If it cannot be worked out, surveyors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should contact their supervisors.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters responded to our request in the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule for recommendations for a regulatory design that could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accommodate the use of scope and severity scales for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining deficiencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A large number of commenters recommended that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we adopt a system for determining deficiencies similar to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that used by the State of Ohio. The Ohio system employs the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of a worksheet that must be completed for each violation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a requirement. The worksheet evaluates violations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against criteria such as preventability and resident choice, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and then classifies violations based on ratings of scope and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
severity into two types. The first type is called a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiency and the second, lesser violation, is called a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finding. Both a deficiency and a finding are recorded on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the statement of deficiencies and are disclosable to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public, but only a deficiency would require a remedy. To 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the extent that the State of Ohio does not use scope and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
severity scales to determine whether a violation should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appear on the statement of deficiencies but rather to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine appropriate enforcement action, the Ohio 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcement system is similar to the one that we proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another model proposed requires a mathematical weight 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for each tag number identified in the interpretive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidelines. Individual data elements would be ranked in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
descending order according to their importance in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation. The model then calls for a statistical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
computation incorporating scope to determine whether a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiency exists. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A third model submitted involves two factors in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining whether an observation is a deficiency. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first factor is preventability. Under this proposal, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either the negative outcome could not have reasonably been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foreseen or if the facility could foresee the negative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outcome and did everything reasonably possible to prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its occurrence but it occurred nonetheless, a deficiency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not be cited, regardless of scope and severity. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
second factor is substantiality. If a facility were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined to be in substantial compliance with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement, a deficiency would not exist. Scope and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
severity would be used to determine if the requirement were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other models that incorporate the concept of substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance into the determination of deficiencies but that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
do not involve the use of scope and severity scales were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also recommended. One commenter suggested that we create an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
audit form outlining the minimum requirements for long term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
care facilities, and then rate each item either a ``pass'' or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a ``fail'' depending upon whether the requirement was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantially met. Another suggestion was that we calculate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a percentage of error rate for each requirement and evaluate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the rating against a tolerable threshold of compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certain commenters believed that for resident outcomes to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have significance in the survey process, negative findings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which have no adverse impact upon the care being received by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residents should not constitute citable deficiencies. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter recommended that we adopt the Joint Commission on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations' accreditation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system which places any minor deficiencies that do not meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substandard care criteria on a recommendation report and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reserves the official citations for substandard care. Other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters believed that guidelines should express a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard of ``practicably met compliance with requirements'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which they asserted would be comparable to the ``highest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practicable'' language applied to facility responsibility for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resident care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the majority of commenters (mostly from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provider community) favored the use of scope and severity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scales to determine deficiencies, a significant number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters did oppose it. Many of these were concerned that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the use of scope and severity scales to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies would violate the intent of the Act that all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements be met and enforced. One commenter noted that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the intent of the Act is to ensure that each individual's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needs are met ``at the highest practicable level,'' not just 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at minimum standards. Others asserted that for enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be resident centered, residents' individual problems must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
matter, and that using scope and severity scales to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine deficiencies would force residents to put up with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a certain amount of misery before the facility would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to address their problems.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are not adopting the use of scope and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
severity scales to identify deficiencies because, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described below, the Act imposes limitations that make it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impractical. However, we are adopting substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance as the standard of performance to which providers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be held. This is consistent with the intent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act, and will accomplish much of what the advocates of scope 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and severity scales claimed that the scales would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplish. Although the thrust of nursing home reform was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to codify a system of nursing home regulation that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outcome oriented, the Congress enacted a number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements that simply do not lend themselves to an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outcome analysis. Moreover, the Act does not always lend 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
itself to an analysis of whether the resident population as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a whole was treated properly which, in our view, would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
essential to a workable scope index. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, section 1919(b)(3)(C)(i)(I) of the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires facilities to conduct a resident assessment no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
later than 14 days after admission. Whether a facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complies with this obligation, which the Act makes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to each resident, rests only on whether the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment was in fact done by the date prescribed in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act. Should a facility conduct an assessment on the 15th 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
day after a resident's admission, that facility will have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failed to comply with the requirement, notwithstanding the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fact that it may have conducted timely assessments on all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other residents, and notwithstanding the fact that there may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been no negative outcome for the resident who received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the untimely assessment. In the same fashion, section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1919(b)(7) of the Act requires that facilities having more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 120 beds employ a full-time social worker. Should a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility having 121 beds not have such an employee, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failure is a clear violation of the statutory standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regardless of whether there are any documented negative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outcomes that resulted from this failure. There are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numerous other examples of this type of requirement in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other requirements in the Act, as some commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pointed out, focus on a facility's duty with respect to each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resident and not its duty to perform in a certain fashion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the bulk of all individuals in residence. Other than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the resident assessment requirement discussed above, section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1919(c)(1)(A) of the Act requires facilities to protect and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promote the rights of each resident. Should a facility, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore, not perform in such a manner (as further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in the Act and implementing regulations) even for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one resident, it cannot be said that the facility was not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficient in this area notwithstanding the fact that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failure was an isolated one. In the same way, section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1919(b)(6) of the Act requires that the health care of every 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resident be under the supervision of a physician (or, at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State's option, other specified health care professionals). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Here, too, a facility may not be determined to meet this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement if it has successfully provided for such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supervision for most of its residents as long as even one of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its residents has not had the benefit of such supervision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is not to say that any violation of these or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similar requirements ought to result in the imposition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanctions of consequence. As we suggested in the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule, and as we require in this final rule, the degree of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seriousness of a deficiency looms large in determining the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriateness of a remedy. In some of the hypothetical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situations cited above, there may be nothing more than a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan of correction that is called for. The point is, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however, that the kind of analysis that allows for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration of a deficiency's seriousness in determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an appropriate remedy will not always work when seriousness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is considered to determine whether a deficiency exists. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
None of the commenters who sought the use of scales in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
context acknowledged these issues squarely or made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggestions that would allow us to address this matter in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
way that comports with the structure of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The substantial compliance standard that we are adopting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tolerates a reasonable degree of imperfection. Even though 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies will be cited for violations that constitute no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actual harm and a potential for no more than minimal harm, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these deficiencies, due to their negligible seriousness, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not deny a provider a certification of compliance nor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject a provider to a remedy. The substantial compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard should also insulate providers from the uneven 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcement that may result from inconsistent surveyor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
behavior, because the marginal deficiencies that surveyors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are likely to be the most uncertain about citing are liable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be the deficiencies that fall into the substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance range, and, consequently, neither a facility in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which a situation constituting no actual harm and a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential for no more than minimal harm was cited as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiency nor a facility in which the same situation was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not cited as a deficiency will be penalized.

One commenter was concerned that a formal

scope and severity scheme to determine deficiencies would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
add issues to hearings.

Providers have the opportunity to appeal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certifications of noncompliance leading to an enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedy, and if we adopted scope and severity scales for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining deficiencies, the commenter is correct that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scope and severity assignments would be an integral part of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the determination of noncompliance, and would therefore be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to challenge if the deficiency led to the imposition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of an enforcement remedy.

Many commenters requested that we incorporate

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We do not believe that the current survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials are subject to the notice and comment procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Administrative Procedure Act. As a result of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OBRA '87, the Medicare and Medicaid law and regulations now 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contain comprehensive, detailed criteria for assessing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality of care provided to Medicare and Medicaid residents, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as well as the standards and methodology for determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies. The survey forms, procedures and guidelines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
merely enable surveyors to certify whether facilities are, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in fact, complying with these binding statutory and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory requirements. These materials do not, in any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
way, add to or change these requirements and thus cannot be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characterized as ``substantive'' rules; rather, they are a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mixture of ``interpretive rules,'' ``general statements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policy,'' and ``rules of agency procedure'' within the meaning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A) which excludes such rules from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice and comment requirements.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the course of reviewing comments, it became 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apparent that many commenters associated the use of scope 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and severity scales to determine deficiencies with results 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that do not depend on using scope and severity scales in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this way. Many commenters were concerned that surveyors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not investigate extenuating circumstances surrounding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violations of requirements unless they were required to use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scope and severity scales for determining deficiencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This is not the case. The surveyor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidelines provide surveyors with a consistent structure to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluate situations and analyze information prior to making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance decisions. One such evaluation that surveyors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are directed to make under certain requirements is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment of a facility's responsibility for a certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situation. For example, survey guidelines list situations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where pressure sores may be unavoidable and aid surveyors in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining whether a resident's pressure sore was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preventable or not. This type of guidance is provided for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
many of the resident-centered requirements. In addition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveyor training courses stress ways to arrive at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent and accurate conclusions as to facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commenters requested that we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require surveyors to consider, when identifying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies, whether or not the facility identified a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violation before the survey and attempted to correct it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We believe that it would be inappropriate to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ignore a failure to prevent a negative outcome, but the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation does allow the competence that the facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrated by identifying and addressing the deficiency on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its own initiative to be considered when enforcement action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is selected.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Certain commenters asked that we direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveyors to determine whether a negative outcome is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result of a resident's refusal of treatment, which is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resident's right. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Whenever there appears to be a conflict 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between a resident's right and the resident's health or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety, we do direct the surveyor in the guidance to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveyors to determine if the facility attempted to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accommodate both the exercise of the resident's right and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the resident's health, including exploration of care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternatives through a thorough planning process in which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the resident may participate.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An additional factor that commenters believed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveyors should take into consideration when determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies is whether the noncompliance occurred because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the facility was following a physician's orders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We cannot allow this to be considered in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiency determination. The facility is accountable for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing to the resident the medical services to which he 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or she is entitled as a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and it is the facility's responsibility to ensure that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services provided by physicians will satisfy the facility's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obligations under the Act and regulations. The statute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically contemplates a relationship between a facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and either the Secretary or the State in which the facility, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in exchange for certification and payments for the care of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program beneficiaries, commits to provide care in a manner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with statutory requirements. A facility cannot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excuse itself from this obligation by deferring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility to an individual (the physician) with whom 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neither the State nor the Secretary has any statutory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relationship for the purpose of maintaining compliance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility health and safety standards.

Many commenters were also very concerned that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we correlate the stringency of the enforcement action with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the seriousness of the deficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is not necessary to use scope and severity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scales when determining deficiencies to ensure this result. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We establish criteria for determining remedies in &sect;488.408, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Selection of remedies, and we link infractions with specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categories of remedial action. Under this scheme, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility with a single deficiency that caused no harm is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treated the same as a facility with on-going, widespread 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problems that threaten resident lives.

facilities with a good history of patient care the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity to correct occasional isolated problems before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the end of the survey so as to avoid deficiency citations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for these problems.

 Any violation of Federal participation

ignore violations on account of a facility's past compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

corrected during the survey, surveyors will note the

the negative outcome is.

 A violation of any participation requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be considered a deficiency, even if the violation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
caused no negative outcome to occur. As discussed earlier, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there are a number of requirements in the Act for which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
questions of outcomes are irrelevant. The deficiency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
citation will in all cases clearly identify how or why the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement is or was not met and the extent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficient practice, but will only detail the impact or

 A great number of commenters complained that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities do not know what is required of them until they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are cited for deficiencies at the time of survey. They 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested that we inform providers of the Medicare or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid participation requirements, or both, to which they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be held accountable. Certain commenters specifically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 There is no reason why any Medicare or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid provider should be unaware of program participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. The requirements are public knowledge, and it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is incumbent upon facilities that enter into Medicare and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid agreements to familiarize themselves with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements with which they have voluntarily agreed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comply. Moreover, copies of the State Operations Manual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter recommended that violations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements be cited as they are discovered so that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility can act upon them immediately. The commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believed that correction should not be delayed until after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the exit conference. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Because we direct surveyors to maintain an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ongoing dialogue with facility staff, there should be few 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instances where the facility is not aware of surveyors' most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
serious concerns prior to the exit conference. We do expect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveyors to immediately communicate to the facility staff 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any findings that jeopardize the health or safety of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residents, but it would be impractical for surveyors to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advise the facility of each and every violation as it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified. It could also be misleading because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies cited on the HCFA&hyph;2567 are not official until 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they are reviewed by supervisory personnel and the State or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA. This review could invalidate or alter some of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies cited by surveyors while onsite at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility.

 Certain commenters asked that we recognize 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a facility's failure to comply with participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements does not always occur at the time of the survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
visit. These commenters requested that we empower surveyors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to write citations for deficiencies that occurred before the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey, even if they were corrected prior to it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If surveyors determine that a facility did 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not meet one or more participation requirements during a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period preceding the survey, they may cite the deficiency, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which may be sanctionable despite its correction prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the survey. The Congress intended for past deficiencies to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be identified and addressed. Sections 1819(h)(2)(A) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1919(h)(1) of the Act provide that if the Secretary or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State finds that a facility meets participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements, but as of a previous period did not meet such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements, then the Secretary or the State may provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a civil money penalty for the days for which it finds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the facility was not in compliance.

Surveyors do not make the ultimate compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision, which is why only a draft of the statement of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies is available to the facility at the time of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exit conference, if at all. The statement of deficiencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is reviewed by the State survey agency which makes the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance decision.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the preamble to the proposed rule, we requested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general public comment about how the severity scale levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were described as well as assigned. We specifically asked 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for comments on the proposed construction of the severity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scale whereby deficiencies at a severity of 3 or 4 can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result in the same sanctions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All comments received in response to this section have

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As mentioned elsewhere in this document, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of commenters expressed concern that HCFA or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey agency may decide to conduct an extended survey at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any time for any reason. One of the reasons for this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concern is that, under regulations at &sect;483.151(b)(2)(iii), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which expressly reflect the statutory requirement, when a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility undergoes an extended (or a partial extended) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey, it automatically loses approval of its Nurse Aide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Training and Competency Evaluation Program (NATCEP) for 2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Our response to that particular comment was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated earlier in this preamble under our discussion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extended surveys. However, there is a closely related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policy we would like to address here that goes beyond NATCEP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rescission as a result of an extended survey. There are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other circumstances described at &sect;483.151(b)(2) that also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trigger a 2-year prohibition on NATCEP. It has been our 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policy that the remainder (if any) of a 2-year prohibition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on NATCEPs also applies to a new owner when the provider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undergoes a change of ownership as defined in &sect;489.18(a), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Change of ownership or leasing: Effect on provider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement. The implicit basis for this policy has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (d) of &sect;489.18, which states that an ``assigned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement is subject to all applicable statutes and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations and to the terms and conditions under which it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was originally issued&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This policy was explicitly set forth in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (56 FR 48894) on September 26, 1991, as well as in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State Operations Letter 91&hyph;75. The latter reads in part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that, ``a facility subject to the prohibition on [NATCEP] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training remains subject for two years after the event 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
triggering the prohibition regardless of the change of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ownership.'' While we have been consistent in this policy, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we have been reexamining it within the larger context of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drafting these regulations. We have been reexamining all of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
our policies and regulations concerning remedies to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that they are consonant with the fundamental purpose of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies, which is to motivate providers to come quickly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into compliance with program requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the proposed rule, we spoke to the purpose of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanctions, saying in part that our intent is to ``deter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violations as well as encourage 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
immediate 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(emphasis added) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
response and sustained compliance.'' If the new owner of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provider must wait for the expiration of the remainder of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2-year prohibition of NATCEP that was imposed on a previous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owner, regardless of any action he or she may take to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correct the deficiencies that triggered the prohibition, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2-year prohibition on NATCEP would be unlike other remedies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As soon as a new owner corrects the noncompliance that led 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the imposition of any other remedy, the remedy can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lifted. The exception to this is that when a facility has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
had a denial of payment imposed against it for repeated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substandard quality of care or has been placed under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temporary management, in addition to achieving substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance, it must demonstrate to HCFA's or the State's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfaction that it will remain in substantial compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
However, it is not just the inconsistency with the other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies which has led us to reexamine our policy on this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue. In addition, HCFA does not want to discourage new, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capable ownership interests from improving the quality of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
care that residents receive. Investing in a NATCEP may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enhance quality of care; to prohibit a new owner from having 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such a program would be counterproductive with the larger 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes of the programs. Therefore, under this regulation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we are changing our policy on transfer of the prohibition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NATCEP to a new owner to bring it into line with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
workings of other remedies. The 2-year restriction of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NATCEP will not apply to the new owner of a provider unless 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that new owner or organization has been the subject of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extended (or partial extended) survey, or is otherwise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to the terms of &sect;483.151, under its tenure. If all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other requirements for the approval of NATCEP are met, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including substantial compliance with all program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements, the new owner may provide NATCEP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have received numerous inquiries from providers as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
well as their attorneys asking what appeal rights are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available when approval of a facility's NATCEP has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
denied or withdrawn. While the Act does not provide for any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formal appeals for denial or withdrawal of a NATCEP, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe that providers ought to have some opportunity to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
challenge this disapproval. Therefore, we expect providers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to appeal their NATCEP disapproval within the timeframes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established for dispute resolution, as described in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;488.331 of this final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have reached this result because, notwithstanding the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fact that the Act permits us and the State survey agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to conduct extended (or partial extended) surveys for any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reason, we are nevertheless under this regulation choosing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to conduct such surveys only when we or a State survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency determines that substandard quality of care exists. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Just as we believe a provider ought to have access to an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
informal dispute resolution mechanism to challenge what it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perceives to be inaccurate survey findings, we believe that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it ought to be able to challenge the correctness of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State survey agency's or HCFA's determination that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substandard quality of care existed. If successful in that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
challenge, then the factual basis for doing the extended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey will have been removed, and, in such cases, it would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be inequitable to saddle the provider with the loss of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NATCEP when there was no factual basis for doing so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are limiting the appeals of these matters to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
informal dispute resolution process because we do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe the loss of a NATCEP is a remedy of the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
magnitude or type as other statutory remedies for which a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more formal appeals mechanism is available. Unlike the case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with other remedies, a facility losing its NATCEP will not, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on that basis alone, face exclusion from the Medicare or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid programs, nor will it face the same kind of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deprivation that is arguably the case with respect to civil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
money penalties, denial of payment, or the imposition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temporary management. We believe the informal dispute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resolution process satisfies essential elements of due 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process here, since a provider will have notice of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended denial of its NATCEP and the opportunity to meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with agency officials to challenge the findings that gave 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rise to the denial.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to change to our regulations identified

above, it is necessary that we make minor, technical, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
editorial or cross reference changes to several other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation sections. We are making conforming changes to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Part 440 (&sect;440.40, 440.140, 440.150); we recodified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;440.150 to separate NFs and ICFs/MR to make it clear which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions apply to each. No substantive changes have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made as a result of this new section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Part 441 (&sect;441.11);

VI. Regulatory Impact Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)
(5 U.S.C. 601 through 612), unless the Secretary certifies that a regulation will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, all long term care facilities are considered
small entities. However, individuals and States are not included in the definition of a small entity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis for any final rule
that may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Such an analysis
must conform to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small
rural hospital as a hospital that is located outside a metropolitan statistical area and has fewer than 50 beds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As described earlier in the preamble, OBRA '87 mandated extensive revisions to the Medicare and Medicaid requirements
for nursing facilities. Under the previous system, long term care facilities were required to meet a set of requirements
called conditions of participation. Each condition of participation included groups of standards, and standards
were made up of separate elements. Enforcement was based on the level of the requirement for which a deficiency was
cited. For example, condition-level deficiencies in a SNF resulted in the initiation of termination procedures
and/or a denial of payment for new admissions. However, if only standard-level deficiencies were found, a plan of
correction was required with no further immediate sanctions. Conditions of participation later became Level A requirements,
and standards and elements became Level B requirements, as the result of a preliminary effort to dismantle the hierarchy
of requirements as mandated by OBRA '87. We revised the requirements that long term care facilities must meet in order
to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs on September 26, 1991 (56 FR 48826). These requirements focus
generally on actual facility performance in meeting residents' needs in a safe and healthy environment, as compared
to prior requirements which focused on the capacity of the facility to provide appropriate care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As of October 1993, there were 10,512 facilities certified for both Medicare and Medicaid (dually participating),
939 SNFs certified only for Medicare, and 4,974 NFs certified only for Medicaid. HCFA data indicate that 7.3 percent
(1,141) of all long term care facilities surveyed in 1992 were found to be deficiency-free. Facilities in full compliance
with the participation requirements would not, of course, be subject to the enforcement remedies contained in this
final rule. Six and one-half percent (1,021) of the surveyed facilities were found to have at least one Level A deficiency
and would have been subject to denial of payment for new admissions and/or termination under the former enforcement
rules. However, the number of involuntary terminations of long term care facilities for calendar year 1992 was 53
(29 SNFs/NFs and 24 NFs), less than one-half of one percent of all participating facilities. This figure demonstrates
that most of the facilities identified during a survey to have at least one serious deficiency can and do correct deficiencies
to avoid termination. The majority of the facilities surveyed (86.2 percent) were determined to have no Level A but
at least one Level B deficiency, a finding that usually would allow the facility to continue to participate for a longer
period of time while taking corrective action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The intent of the OBRA '87 legislation was to provide the Secretary and States with the authority to impose timely,
alternative remedies on noncompliant facilities that, under the previous enforcement process, had no incentive
to promptly correct deficiencies and maintain lasting compliance. Our proposed rule (57 FR 39278, August 28, 1992)
delineated the process we would use to survey, assess, and enforce facility compliance with all participation requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is clear that a large number of small entities will be affected by adoption of these procedures, and, as intended
by OBRA '87, a substantial number of those entities are at risk of some remedy if they are noncompliant until they make
changes in their operations to meet certification requirements. Therefore, we have prepared the following analysis
which, in combination with the rest of the preamble, is intended to conform to the objectives of the RFA. We are not preparing
a rural impact statement since we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this final rule will not have
a significant impact on the operations of substantial number of small rural hospitals.

B. Affected Entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We expect that the implementation of these final regulations will significantly influence facilities to conform
quickly with the Federal participation requirements in order to avoid remedies. We recognize that not all of the potential
effects of this final rule can be definitely anticipated, especially in view of their interaction with other Federal,
State, and local activities regarding adherence to requirements for participation in Medicare and Medicaid. In
particular, considering the effects of our efforts to improve survey and certification activities, through both
new survey procedures and instruments and the promulgation of regulations, it is impossible to quantify precisely
the future effect of all of these regulations on facilities' compliance activities or costs. We also are unable to
accurately project the frequency with which enforcement proceedings may occur in light of the options to apply a host
of remedies short of termination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of the 27,900 comments received in response to our proposed rule, virtually every aspect of the regulation
was re-evaluated. Where warranted, changes were made and the details of those changes were discussed in detail in
the preceding section of the preamble to this rule. In response to our proposed revisions to part 431, most of the negative
comments concerned the effect on ICFs/MR of withdrawing FFP during appeals. Some commenters noted that OBRA '87 specifically
exempted ICFs/MR from its scope, and stated that it is not appropriate to change the ICF/MR rules in implementing a
law that applies to other facilities. We agree that it would be preferable to include the provisions applicable to
ICFs/MR at a later date in rulemaking focused on ICFs/MR. Therefore, we are adopting the commenters' proposals that
the 120 days of FFP continue for ICFs/MR until such rulemaking is carried out, and are leaving the existing appeals
system in place for ICFs/MR. Thus, neither ICFs/MR nor their residents will experience any impact from this final
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also based on commenters' suggestions, we incorporate in this final rule the concept of substantial compliance as
the standard that prospective providers and existing providers must meet in order to begin or continue to participate
in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. After evaluation of the comments received, and in consideration of the fact
that, as noted earlier, only 7.3 percent of all nursing homes surveyed in 1992 were deficiency-free, we believe that
total compliance with all requirements is unrealistic and, in fact, a standard that many providers or prospective
providers would find impossible to meet. We note that the statute now sets forth more than 100 requirements that facilities
have to meet in order to participate in the Medicare or Medicaid programs, whereas before OBRA '87, facilities had
to comply with approximately 15. With the seven-fold increase in statutory requirements, there is a greater likelihood
that facilities will be found not to meet the statutory definition of a SNF or NF. We are convinced, however, based on
experience and commenters' views, that many statutory deficiencies do not result in actual harm to residents, nor
do they constitute the potential for anything more than minimal harm. We realized that under the provisions of our
proposed rule, a facility could have been subject to the most severe remedies, including denial of payment for new
admissions, termination of the provider agreement for SNFs and discontinuation of FFP for NFs, if any deficiency,
no matter how minor, was identified at the time of the survey. We recognized that imposing a remedy in all cases would
be contrary to our intention to correlate the severity of the remedy to the seriousness of the deficiency, and would
have a negative effect on facilities and residents. Instead, this final rule provides that remedies will not be imposed
when a facility is in substantial compliance with all participation requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are removing the scope and severity scales from the regulation and are, instead, providing assessment factors
which consider scope and severity to be used in evaluating the seriousness of deficiencies and determining whether
an enforcement response is required. We continue to believe, as we proposed, that because remedies are tailored to
reflect the seriousness of the violations, the use of the assessment factors will provide consistent remedy recommendations
and enforcement actions among all facilities. Since facilities will be aware of the correlation between the seriousness
of the noncompliance and the penalty imposed, we anticipate that remedies applied in this manner will deter violations
and encourage immediate response and sustained compliance. Based on the large number of comments we received expressing
concern over the imposition of civil money penalties, which can be imposed for past periods of noncompliance, we expect
that the regulations will have the desired effect of motivating facilities to remain in substantial compliance at
all times.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these final rules, a facility with isolated deficiencies that constitute no actual harm with potential for
minimal harm will be expected to correct the deficiencies and maintain compliance. However, a formal plan of correction
is required for deficiencies that constitute no actual harm with potential for minimal harm if the deficiencies are
widespread or if they constitute a pattern. A formal plan of correction is also required for all deficiencies that
constitute noncompliance. Facilities with deficiencies that constitute no actual harm with potential for no more
than minimal harm will be considered in substantial compliance with the participation requirements and will have
no remedy applied. We believe that the majority of the 86 percent of the facilities cited in 1992 with at least one Level
B deficiency would fall within this range. We note, however, that some noncompliance categorized previously as Level
B deficiencies could now result in remedies because of their effect on the residents.

In response to commenters, we are requiring that States provide an opportunity for informal dispute resolution whereby
providers dissatisfied with survey findings can request a review of the deficiencies upon receipt of the official
HCFA&hyph;2567. Dispute resolution augments the various other opportunities facilities have during and after
the survey to challenge the surveyors' findings, including during the survey, at the exit conference, while awaiting
receipt of the official deficiency statement, through dialogue with State and regional officials, and upon receipt
of the official statement of deficiencies. The process we are requiring generally reflects current practice and
guidance we have consistently given States, except that here it is formally adopted as a rule. While we believe that
many formal hearings will be avoided by utilizing dispute resolution, the regulations provide facilities with the
opportunity to appeal certifications of noncompliance leading to an enforcement remedy, and specify the formal
administrative and judicial review processes. However, because the Act mandates that enforcement systems minimize
the time between identification of violations and the imposition of remedies, we are not requiring that hearings
be held before the effective date of the enforcement action, except in the case of civil money penalties. Facilities
facing civil money penalties may also appeal the level of noncompliance but only where a successful challenge would
affect the amount of the civil money penalty that HCFA or the State could collect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the variety of alternative remedies now available, we believe termination will be the enforcement response
to the most serious noncompliance, and it can be avoided by facilities that are willing and able to effectively allocate
their resources to ensure substantial compliance. To the extent that those marginal facilities that are most at risk
from these provisions are able to come into substantial compliance, there may even be a reduction in the frequency
of enforcement actions. Of course, facilities will ordinarily incur some costs associated with compliance efforts.
Those costs could be significant if they necessitate substantial staffing increases or alterations to a physical
plant. Our elimination of FFP after termination of the provider agreement during the administrative hearing process
provides an incentive for facilities to comply promptly with enforcement actions, but could also add to the impact
on facilities.

C. Effect on State Survey Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The impact that this final rule will have on State survey agencies' surveys must be viewed in the context of other ongoing
activities related to survey and certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 1, 1986, HCFA implemented its new long term care outcome-oriented survey process (formerly called PACs:
Patient Care and Services Survey Process). This system shifted the emphasis away from the facility's capacity to
provide adequate care to the facility's success in providing such care. On October 1, 1990, HCFA implemented a revised
outcome-oriented survey process that includes the OBRA provision of resident rights review. Because the effective
date of this rule is July 1, 1995, training courses can be designed and offered timely to provide the State agency surveyors
and other staff with information on assessing the seriousness of deficiencies. The knowledge they gain in applying
Federal survey requirements in an accurate, consistent, and time efficient manner, should lead to improved surveys
at no increase in costs. We do not expect that assessing the seriousness of the deficiencies will add to the time needed
to conduct a survey since this process is one that surveyors have essentially engaged in for years. We do not expect
these regulations to necessitate greater expenditures on the part of State survey agencies; however, they probably
will result in a reallocation of resources, particularly geared to more intensive monitoring of marginal facilities.
Further, these regulatory changes will contribute to a shift toward more enforcement-oriented roles for State survey
agencies and surveyors. Although States will have an expanded role and increased responsibility as a result of this
final rule, they will also be given increased flexibility in carrying out their responsibilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We expect some incremental costs to facilities and to States as a result of facility appeals of termination and alternative
remedies. Although we have no experience on which to predict increases in volume or cost, we believe that the increase
will be offset somewhat as some hearings will be avoided as a result of dispute resolution. The appeals process has
been thoroughly explained elsewhere in this preamble. The responses to comments illustrate the thoughtful approach
taken, with a view to minimizing burden in implementing statutory requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Effect on Residents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We expect this final rule to result in improved quality of life and care for residents of long term care facilities.
Because of the various enforcement tools provided by this regulation, facilities will have more of an incentive to
remain in compliance with participation requirements. This sustained compliance will provide residents with consistent,
high quality health care. Because quality of life can be affected by a resident's sense of satisfaction with his or
her environment, the quality of care received, and the extent of control over his or her life, heightened facility
interest in maintaining substantial compliance should be perceived by residents and their families as improved
care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While termination of SNFs and NFs could have a significant impact on residents, especially those living in rural areas,
this final rule provides a variety of alternatives to termination for those facilities that are able to come into compliance.
To the extent that termination occurs less frequently, there would be less disruption to nursing home residents and
ensured access to needed services. In those cases in which termination becomes necessary, the termination is for
the ultimate benefit of the residents to assure that they receive the quality care to which they are entitled.

not eligible to participate in the program, such documentation includes, in addition to the description of the specific
deficiencies which resulted in the agency's recommendation, any provider or supplier response.

(a) Special rules for certification of noncompliance for SNFs and NFs are set forth in &sect;488.330. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The State agency will certify that a provider or supplier is not or is no longer in compliance with the conditions
of participation or conditions for coverage where the deficiencies are of such character as to substantially limit
the provider's or supplier's capacity to furnish adequate care or which adversely affect the health and safety of
patients; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If HCFA determines that an institution or agency does not qualify for participation or coverage because it is not
in compliance with the conditions of participation or conditions for coverage, or if a provider's agreement is terminated
for that reason, the institution or agency has the right to request that the determination be reviewed. (Appeals procedures
are set forth in Part 498 of this chapter.)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Additional rules for certification of compliance for SNFs and NFs are set forth in &sect;488.330. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The decision as to whether there is compliance with a particular requirement, condition of participation, or
condition for coverage depends upon the manner and degree to which the provider or supplier satisfies the various
standards within each condition. Evaluation of a provider's or supplier's performance against these standards
enables the State survey agency to document the nature and extent of deficiencies, if any, with respect to a particular
function, and to assess the need for improvement in relation to the prescribed conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The State survey agency must adhere to the following principles in determining compliance with participation
requirements: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The survey process is the means to assess compliance with Federal health, safety and quality standards; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The survey process uses resident outcomes as the primary means to establish the compliance status of facilities.
Specifically surveyors will directly observe the actual provision of care and services to residents, and the effects
of that care, to assess whether the care provided meets the needs of individual residents; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Surveyors are professionals who use their judgment, in concert with Federal forms and procedures, to determine
compliance; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Federal procedures are used by all surveyors to ensure uniform and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent application and interpretation of Federal requirements;

(d) The State survey agency must use the survey methods, procedures, and forms that are prescribed by HCFA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

effects of that care on residents are assessed in a systematic manner.

Providers or suppliers, other than SNFs and NFs, with deficiencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) If a provider or supplier is found to be deficient with respect to one or more of the standards in the conditions of
participation or conditions for coverage, it may participate in or be covered under the Health Insurance for the Aged
and Disabled Program only if the facility has submitted an acceptable plan of correction for achieving compliance
within a reasonable period of time acceptable to the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The existing deficiencies noted either individually or in combination neither jeopardize the health and safety
of patients nor are of such character as to seriously limit the provider's capacity to render adequate care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c)(1) If it is determined during a survey that a provider or supplier is not in compliance with one or more of the standards,
it is granted a reasonable time to achieve compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The amount of time depends upon the_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Nature of the deficiency; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) State survey agency's judgment as to the capabilities of the facility to provide adequate and safe care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Ordinarily a provider or supplier is expected to take the steps needed to achieve compliance within 60 days of being
notified of the deficiencies but the State survey agency may recommend that additional time be granted by the Secretary
in individual situations, if in its judgment, it is not reasonable to expect compliance within 60 days, for example,
a facility must obtain the approval of its governing body, or engage in competitive bidding.

Responsibility for certification. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) The State survey agency surveys all facilities for compliance or noncompliance with requirements for long term
care facilities. The survey by the State survey agency may be followed by a Federal validation survey. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The State certifies the compliance or noncompliance of non-State operated NFs. Regardless of the State entity
doing the certification, it is final, except in the case of a complaint or validation survey conducted by HCFA, or HCFA
review of the State's findings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

approval of HCFA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) The State survey agency certifies compliance or noncompliance for a dually participating SNF/NF. In the case
of a disagreement between HCFA and the State survey agency, a finding of noncompliance takes precedence over that
of compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) In the case of a validation survey, the Secretary's determination as to the facility's noncompliance is binding,
and takes precedence over a certification of compliance resulting from the State survey.

(i) Certification by the State is based on the survey agency findings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Certification by HCFA is based on either the survey agency findings (in the case of State-operated facilities),
or, in the case of a validation survey, on HCFA's own survey findings.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Certification of compliance. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A certification of compliance constitutes a determination that the facility is in substantial compliance and is

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Certification of noncompliance. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A certification of noncompliance requires denial of participation for prospective providers and enforcement action
for current providers in accordance with subpart F of this part. Enforcement action must include one of the following:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Termination of any Medicare or Medicaid provider agreements that are in effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Initial assessment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to select the appropriate remedy, if any, to apply to a facility with deficiencies, HCFA and the State determine
the seriousness of the deficiencies.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Determining seriousness of deficiencies. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To determine the seriousness of the deficiency, HCFA considers and the State must consider at least the following
factors:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Whether a facility's deficiencies constitute_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) No actual harm with a potential for minimal harm; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) No actual harm with a potential for more than minimal harm, but not immediate jeopardy; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Actual harm that is not immediate jeopardy; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Immediate jeopardy to resident health or safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Whether the deficiencies_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Are isolated; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Constitute a pattern; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Are widespread. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Other factors which may be considered in choosing a remedy within a remedy category. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Following the initial assessment, HCFA and the State may consider other factors, which may include, but are not limited
to the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The relationship of the one deficiency to other deficiencies resulting in noncompliance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) HCFA does and the State must notify the facility that a temporary manager is being appointed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the facility fails to relinquish control to the temporary manager, HCFA does and the State must terminate the
provider agreement within 23 calendar days of the last day of the survey, if the immediate jeopardy is not removed.
In these cases, State monitoring may be imposed pending termination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the facility relinquishes control to the temporary manager, the State must (and HCFA does) notify the facility
that, unless it removes the immediate jeopardy, its provider agreement will be terminated within 23 calendar days
of the last day of the survey. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(i) Take immediate action to remove the jeopardy and correct the noncompliance through temporary management; or

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Terminate the facility's participation under the State plan. If this is done, HCFA will also terminate the facility's
participation in Medicare if it is a dually participating facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The State must provide for the safe and orderly transfer of residents when the facility is terminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) If the immediate jeopardy is also substandard quality of care, the State survey agency must notify attending physicians
and the State board responsible for licensing the facility administrator of the finding of substandard quality of
care, as specified in &sect;488.325(h).

(a) If a facility's deficiencies do not pose immediate jeopardy to residents' health or safety, and the facility is
not in substantial compliance, HCFA or the State may terminate the facility's provider agreement or may allow the
facility to continue to participate for no longer than 6 months from the last day of the survey if_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The State survey agency finds that it is more appropriate to impose alternative remedies than to terminate the
facility's provider agreement; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The State survey agency has submitted a plan of correction approved by HCFA; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The facility in the case of a Medicare SNF or the State in the case of a Medicaid NF agrees to repay to the Federal government
payments received after the last day of the survey that first identified the deficiencies if corrective action is
not taken in accordance with the approved plan of correction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If a facility does not meet the criteria for continuation of payment under paragraph (a) of this section, HCFA will
and the State must terminate the facility's provider agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) HCFA does and the State must deny payment for new admissions when a facility is not in substantial compliance 3 months
after the last day of the survey. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) HCFA terminates the provider agreement for SNFs and NFs, and stops FFP to a State for a NF for which participation
was continued under paragraph (a) of this section, if the facility is not in substantial compliance within 6 months
of the last day of the survey.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a facility has been found to have provided substandard quality of care on the last three consecutive standard surveys,
as defined in &sect;488.305, regardless of other remedies provided_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) HCFA imposes denial of payment for all new admissions, as specified in &sect;488.417, or denial of all payments,
as specified in &sect;488.418; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The State must impose denial of payment for all new admissions, as specified in &sect;488.417; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) HCFA does and the State survey agency must impose State monitoring, as specified in &sect;488.422, until the facility
has demonstrated to the satisfaction of HCFA or the State, that it is in substantial compliance with all requirements
and will remain in substantial compliance with all requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Repeated noncompliance. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of this section, repeated noncompliance is based on the repeated finding of substandard quality of care
and not on the basis that the substance of the deficiency or the exact tag number for the deficiency was repeated.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Program participation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The determination that a certified facility has repeated instances of substandard quality of care is made without
regard to any variances in the facility's program participation (that is, any standard survey completed for Medicare,
Medicaid or both programs will be considered). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Termination would allow the count of repeated substandard quality of care surveys to start over.

(3) Change of ownership. (i) A facility may not avoid a remedy on the basis that it underwent a change of ownership. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) In a facility that has undergone a change of ownership, HCFA does not and the State may not restart the count of repeated
substandard quality of care surveys unless the new owner can demonstrate to the satisfaction of HCFA or the State that
the poor past performance no longer is a factor due to the change in ownership.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) HCFA does and the State must increase the penalty amount for any repeated deficiencies for which a lower level penalty
amount was previously imposed, regardless of whether the increased penalty amount would exceed the range otherwise
reserved for nonimmediate jeopardy deficiencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Repeated deficiencies are deficiencies in the same regulatory grouping of requirements found at the last survey,
subsequently corrected, and found again at the next survey.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When an administrative law judge or State hearing officer (or higher administrative review authority) finds that
the basis for imposing a civil money penalty exists, as specified in &sect;488.430, the administrative law judge
or State hearing officer (or higher administrative review authority) may not_

Factors affecting the amount of penalty. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In determining the amount of penalty, HCFA does or the State must take into account the following factors:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The facility's history of noncompliance, including repeated deficiencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The facility's financial condition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The factors specified in &sect;488.404.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The facility's degree of culpability. Culpability 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
for purposes of this paragraph includes, but is not limited to, neglect, indifference, or disregard for resident
care, comfort or safety. The absence of culpability is not a mitigating circumstance in reducing the amount of the
penalty.

Disagreement over timing of termination of facility. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State's timing of termination takes precedence if it does not occur later than 6 months after the last day of the
survey when both HCFA and the State find that_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A facility is not in substantial compliance; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The facility's participation should be terminated.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Disagreement over remedies.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) When HCFA or the State, but not both, establishes one or more remedies, in addition to or as an alternative to termination,
the additional or alternative remedies will also apply when_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Both HCFA and the State find that a facility has not achieved substantial compliance; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Both HCFA and the State find that no immediate jeopardy exists. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Overlap of remedies. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When HCFA and the State establish one or more remedies, in addition to or as an alternative to termination, only the
HCFA remedies apply when both HCFA and the State find that a facility has not achieved substantial compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Regardless of whether HCFA's or the State's decision controls, only one noncompliance and enforcement decision
is applied to the Medicaid agreement, and for a dually participating facility, that same decision will apply to the
Medicare agreement.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) designates endangered status pursuant to the Endangered Species Act
of 1973, as amended (Act), for the plant 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Poa mannii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Mann's bluegrass). Four extant populations containing a total of approximately 125 individuals of the species
are known to occur in the northwestern and north-central region of the island of Kauai. The species and its habitat
are threatened by goats, competition by naturalized, introduced vegetation, fire, landslides, and erosion. The
existence of few populations and individuals increases the likelihood of extinction from stochastic events and/or
reduced reproductive vigor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule implements the Federal protection provisions provided by the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Journal of Botany
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in 1869. The specific epithet was selected to honor one of the original collectors. Subsequently, the species was
validly published by Hillebrand (1888) in his flora.

Poa mannii 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
of the grass family (Poaceae) is a perennial with short rhizomes (underground stems) and erect, tufted culms (bunched
stems) 50 to 75 centimeters (cm) (20 to 30 inches (in)) tall. The leaf sheath completely surrounds the leaf, and the
ligule (appendage at the junction of the leaf blade and sheath) completely encircles the stem, is about 0.5 millimeters
(mm) (0.02 in) long, and has a tooth about 2 to 4 mm (0.08 to 0.2 in) long and a fringed margin. The leaf blade is up to 15 cm
(6 in) long and 2 to 4 mm (0.08 to 0.2 in) wide, and has a rough upper surface and a hairless lower surface. The panicles
(branched flower clusters) are usually less than 5 cm (2 in) long and have primary branches 5 to 20 mm (0.2 to 0.8 in) long.
The 4 to 7 mm (0.2 to 0.3 in) long, flattened spikelets (ultimate flower clusters) are pale greenish or yellowish brown
and usually are comprised of 4 or 5 flowers. The glumes (small pair of bracts at the base of each spikelet) are about 3
mm (0.1 in) long. The lemma (outer bract at the base of a floret) is 3 to 4 mm (0.1 to 0.2 in) long and has cobwebby hairs at
its base. The palea (inner bract at the base of a floret) is 3 to 3.5 mm (about 0.1 in) long and has a sharp, longitudinal
ridge. The reddish brown grain-like fruit is elliptical to spindle-shaped and about 1.5 mm (0.06 in) long. All three
native species of

Poa mannii

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
is found only on the northwestern and west-central portions of the island of Kauai. The four known populations extend
over a distance of about 10.5 by 8.5 kilometers (km) (6.5 by 5.3 miles (mi)) and are found in Kalalau, Makaha, Koaie,
and Waialae Valleys, all on State lands (David Lorence, National Tropical Botanical Garden, pers. comm., 1992).
The species was formerly found in Olokele Gulch (O'Connor 1990). Approximately 125 individuals have been observed
in the extant populations. This species typically grows on cliffs and rock faces at elevations between 460 and 1,150
meters (m) (1,510 and 3,770 feet (ft)) in lowland and montane mesic forests. Associated species include:

Federal action on 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Poa mannii 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
began as a result of section 12 of the Act, which directed the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution to prepare a
report on plants considered to be endangered, threatened, or extinct in the United States. This report, designated
as House Document No. 94&hyph;51, was presented to Congress on January 9, 1975. On July 1, 1975, the Service published
a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (40 FR 27823) of its acceptance of the Smithsonian report as a petition within the context of section 4(c)(2) (now section
4(b)(3)) of the Act, and giving notice of its intention to review the status of the plant taxa named therein. As a result
of that review, on June 16, 1976, the Service published a proposed rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (41 FR 24523) to determine endangered status pursuant to section 4 of the Act for approximately 1,700 vascular plant
species. The list of 1,700 plant taxa was assembled on the basis of comments and data received by the Smithsonian Institution
and the Service in response to House Document No. 94&hyph;51 and the July 1, 1975, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

 publication. General comments received in response to the 1976 proposal are summarized in an April 26, 1978, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 publication (43 FR 17909). In 1978, amendments to the Act required that all proposals over two years old be withdrawn.
A one-year grace period was given to proposals already over two years old. On December 10, 1979, the Service published
a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (44 FR 70796) withdrawing the portion of the June 16, 1976, proposal that had not been made final, including 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Poa mannii, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
along with four other proposals that had expired. The Service published updated notices of review for plants on December
15, 1980 (45 FR 82479), September 27, 1985 (50 FR 39525), and February 21, 1990 (55 FR 6183). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Poa mannii 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
was first included in the 1980 and 1985 notices of review as a category 1 species. Category 1 taxa are those for which
the Service has on file substantial information on biological vulnerability and threats to support preparation
of listing proposals. In the 1990 notice of review, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Poa mannii 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
was considered a category 1* species. Category 1* taxa are those which are possibly extinct. Since the 1990 notice
of review, three previously unknown populations of the species have been discovered, and a population has been found
in an area in which the plant was formerly known. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act requires the Secretary to make findings on petitions that present substantial information
indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted within 12 months of their receipt. Section 2(b)(1) of the 1982
amendments further required all petitions pending on October 13, 1982, be treated as having been newly submitted
on that date. On October 13, 1983, the Service found that the petitioned listing of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Poa mannii 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
was warranted, but precluded by other pending listing actions, in accordance with section 4(b)(3)(B)(iii) of the
Act; notification of this finding was published on January 20, 1984 (49 FR 2485). Such a finding requires the Service
to consider the petition as having been resubmitted pursuant to section 4(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Act. The finding was
reviewed in October of 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1991. Publication of the proposed rule constituted
the final 1-year finding for this species.

factual reports or information that might contribute to the development of a final rule. The public comment period
ended June 7, 1993. Appropriate State agencies, county governments, Federal agencies, scientific organizations,
and other interested parties were contacted and requested to comment. A newspaper notice inviting public comment
was published in ``The Honolulu Advertiser'' on May 12, 1993, and ``The Garden Isle'' on May 16, 1993. No letters of

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4 of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1533) and regulations (50 CFR Part 424) promulgated to implement
the Act set forth the procedures for adding species to the Federal Lists. A species may be determined to be an endangered
species due to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Its Habitat or Range
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The area of Kauai in which 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Poa mannii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is found has undergone extreme alteration because of past and present land management practices, including grazing,
deliberate alien plant and animal introductions, water diversion, and recreational development (Wagner

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1985). Feral animals have had the greatest overall impact, altering and degrading the vegetation and habitats of
the area; feral goats currently cause the greatest damage to the area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Feral goats, which have inhabited the drier, more rugged areas of Kauai since the 1820s, consume native vegetation,
trample roots and seedlings, cause erosion, and promote the invasion of alien plants (Cuddihy and Stone 1990). Feral
goats on Kauai are managed as a game species with a limited hunting season (Tomich 1986), but their numbers are large
enough to cause considerable habitat damage. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Poa mannii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 survives only in very steep areas that are inaccessible to goats, suggesting that goat predation may have eliminated
this species from more accessible locations, as is the case for other rare plants from northwestern Kauai (Corn

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Unrestricted collecting for scientific or horticultural purposes and excessive visits by individuals interested
in seeing rare plants could result from increased publicity. This is a potential threat to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Poa mannii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 grow. Predation is a probable reason that this species is currently found only on cliff faces inaccessible to goats
(D. Lorence and K. Wood, pers. comms., 1992). Predation by goats constitutes a threat to the expansion of the extant
populations of

D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
All four populations of Poa mannii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 are located on State conservation district land, which, among other purposes, are regarded as necessary for the protection
of endemic biological resources and the maintenance or enhancement of the conservation of natural resources. Activities
permitted in the conservation district are chosen by considering how best to make multiple use of the land (HRS, sect.
205&hyph;2). Some uses, such as maintaining animals for hunting, are based on policy decisions, while others, such
as preservation of endangered species, are mandated by both Federal and State laws. Requests for amendments to district
boundaries or variances within existing classifications can be made by government agencies and private landowners
(HRS, sect. 205&hyph;4). Before decisions on these requests are made, the impact of the proposed reclassification
on ``preservation or maintenance of important natural systems or habitat'' (HRS, sects. 205&hyph;4, 205&hyph;17),
as well as the maintenance of natural resources, is required to be taken into account (HRS, sects. 205&hyph;2, 205&hyph;4).
For any proposed land use change that would occur on county or State land, that would be funded in part or whole by county
or State funds, or that would occur within land classified as conservation district, an environmental assessment
is required to determine whether or not the environment will be significantly affected (HRS, chapt. 343). If it is
found that an action will have a significant effect, preparation of a full Environmental Impact Statement is required.
Hawaii environmental policy and, thus, approval of land use, is required by law to safeguard ``*&blank;*&blank;*
the State's unique natural environmental characteristics *&blank;*&blank;*'' (HRS, sect. 344&hyph;3(1)) and
includes guidelines to ``protect endangered species of individual plants and animals *&blank;*&blank;*'' (HRS,
sect. 344&hyph;4(3)(A)). However, the species is not presently protected as an endangered species under the State's
endangered species provisions, and, despite provisions for conserving endemic resources, individual rare species
may be overlooked during consideration of other land use priorities.

E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued Existence
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The existence of only four populations consisting of approximately 125 individuals of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Poa mannii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 increases the potential for extinction from stochastic events. The limited gene pool may depress reproductive vigor,
or a single human-caused or natural environmental disturbance, a disease, or predation could destroy an entire population
and a significant percentage of the known individuals of the species. In the steep areas where 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Poa mannii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 grows, erosion and landslides due to natural weathering can result in the death of individual plants as well as habitat
destruction. This process especially affects the continued existence of species or populations with limited numbers
and/or narrow ranges, such as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Poa mannii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and can be exacerbated by human disturbance and land use practices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Competition by alien plant species is a threat to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Poa mannii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Brought to Hawaii as a cultivated herbaceous plant, daisy fleabane has become naturalized in wetter regions of four
islands (Wagner 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1990). Daisy fleabane has invaded Kalalau, Koaie, and Waialae Valleys, three of the four areas where 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Poa mannii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 occurs (K. Wood, pers. comm., 1992). Lantana, brought to Hawaii as an ornamental plant, is an aggressive, thicket-forming
shrub that can now be found on all of the main islands in mesic forests, dry shrublands, and other dry, disturbed habitats
(Wagner 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1990). Lantana threatens all known populations of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Poa mannii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (D. Lorence and K. Wood, pers. comms., 1992). Prickly Florida blackberry, an aggressive alien species in disturbed
mesic to wet forests and subalpine grasslands on four islands, is considered a noxious weed by the State of Hawaii (Smith
1985, Wagner 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1990). Prickly Florida blackberry threatens the Kalalau and Waialae Valley populations of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Poa mannii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (K. Wood, pers. comm., 1992).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fire is considered an immediate threat to the rare plants of the cliff faces and valleys of the Na Pali Coast, where the
largest known population of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Poa mannii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 occurs. Under dry conditions, human-set fires would spread rapidly and could destroy these plants, due to the strong
prevailing winds and dry fuel load on cliff ledges. Fire could destroy dormant seeds as well as plants, even on steep
cliffs (Clarke and Cuddihy 1980).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past,
present, and future threats faced by this species in finalizing this rule. Based on this evaluation, this rulemaking
will list 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Poa mannii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as endangered. This species numbers only approximately 125 individuals in four known extant populations. Threats
to the continued existence of the species include habitat degradation and/or predation by goats, competition from
alien plants, fire, landslides and erosion, and lack of legal protection or difficulty in enforcing laws that become
effective with this listing action. Small population size and limited distribution make the species particularly
vulnerable to extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor from stochastic events. Because 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Poa mannii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range, it fits the definition of endangered
as defined in the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Critical habitat is not being proposed for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Poa mannii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for reasons discussed in the ``Critical Habitat'' section of this final rule.

Critical Habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary
designate critical habitat at the time a species is determined to be endangered or threatened. The Service finds that
designation of critical habitat is not presently prudent for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Poa mannii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The publication of a map and precise description of critical habitat in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, as required in a designation of critical habitat, would increase the degree of threat to this species from take or
vandalism and, therefore, could contribute to its decline. The listing of this species as endangered publicizes
the rarity of the plant and, thus, can make it attractive to researchers, curiosity seekers, or collectors of rare
plants. All involved parties and the major landowner have been notified of the location and importance of protecting
the habitat of this species, which will be addressed through the recovery process and through the section 7 consultation
process. There are no known Federal activities within the currently known natural habitat of this species. Therefore,
the Service finds that designation of critical habitat for this species is not prudent at this time, because such designation
would increase the degree of threat from vandalism, collecting, or other human activities and because it is unlikely
to aid in the conservation of this species.

Available Conservation Measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered under the Act include recognition, recovery actions,
requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain activities. Listing encourages conservation
actions by Federal, State, and local agencies, private organizations, and individuals. The Act provides for possible
land acquisition and cooperation with the State and requires that recovery plans be developed for listed species.
The requirement for Federal agencies and the prohibitions against certain activities involving listed plants are
discussed, in part, below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any taxon
that is proposed or listed as endangered and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations
implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR Part 402. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely
to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species or to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat.
If a Federal action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency must enter
into consultation with the Service. There are no known Federal activities that occur within the presently known habitat

The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.61, 17.62, and 17.63 set forth a series of general prohibitions
and exceptions that apply to all endangered plant species. With respect to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Poa mannii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, all prohibitions of section 9(a)(2) of the Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.61, would apply. These prohibitions, in
part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to import or export any endangered
plant species to/from the United States; transport such species in interstate or foreign commerce in the course of
a commercial activity; sell or offer for sale such species in interstate or foreign commerce; remove and reduce to
possession any such species from areas under Federal jurisdiction; maliciously damage or destroy any such species
on any area under Federal jurisdiction; or remove, cut, dig up, damage, or destroy any such species on any other area
in knowing violation of any State law or regulation or in the course of any violation of a State criminal trespass law.
Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies. Section 10 of the Act and 50 CFR
17.62 also provide for the issuance of permits under certain circumstances to carry out activities involving endangered
plants that are otherwise prohibited by section 9. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the policy of the Service (59 FR 34272) to identify to the maximum extent practicable at the time a species is listed
those activities that would or would not constitute a violation of section 9 of the Act. Such information is intended
to clarify the potential impacts of a species' listing on proposed and ongoing activities within the species' range.
The four known populations of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 occur on cliffs and rock faces located on State lands. The Service is not aware of any otherwise legal activities proposed
or being conducted by the public at this time that will be affected by this listing and result in a violation of section
9. Questions regarding whether specific activities will constitute a violation of section 9 should be directed to
the Field Supervisor of the Service's Pacific Islands Office (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->

Federal listing will automatically invoke listing under the State's endangered species act. Hawaii's endangered
species act states, ``Any species of aquatic life, wildlife, or land plant that has been determined to be an endangered
species pursuant to the [Federal] Endangered Species Act shall be deemed to be an endangered species under the provisions
of this chapter *&blank;*&blank;*'' (HRS, sect. 195D&hyph;4(a)). Therefore, Federal listing will accord the species
listed status under Hawaii State law. State law prohibits cutting, collecting, uprooting, destroying, injuring,
or possessing any listed species of plant on State or private land, or attempting to engage in any such conduct. State
law also encourages conservation of such species by State agencies and triggers other State regulations to protect
the species (HRS, sect. 195D&hyph;4 and 5). Two populations of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Poa mannii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 occur in forest reserves, which have rules and regulations for the protection of resources. State law mandates the
development and implementation of programs concerning the conservation of biological resources, including this
endangered species (HRS, sect. 195D&hyph;5(a)).

The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement,
as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in connection
with regulations adopted pursuant to section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A notice outlining
the Service's reasons for this determination was published in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Vigna o-wahuensis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
(Oahu vigna). These 12 species are found on 1 or more of the following Hawaiian Islands: Laysan, Necker, Nihoa, Niihau,
Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Lanai, Kahoolawe, Maui, and Hawaii. The 12 species and their habitats have been variously affected
or are currently threatened by one or more of the following: habitat degradation and/or predation by wild, feral,
or domestic animals (pigs, goats, deer, cattle); competition for space, light, water, and nutrients by naturalized,
introduced vegetation; habitat loss from fires; human impacts from recreational activities; and insect infestations.
Due to the small number of existing individuals and/or their very narrow distributions, these species and most of
their populations are subject to an increased likelihood of extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor from stochastic
events. This rule implements the protection provisions provided by the Act for these plant taxa.

The Hawaiian archipelago includes eight large volcanic islands (Niihau, Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Lanai, Kahoolawe,
Maui, and Hawaii), as well as offshore islets, shoals, and atolls set on submerged volcanic remnants at the northwest
end of the chain (the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands). The archipelago covers a land area of about 16,600 square kilometers
(sq km) (6,400 sq miles (mi)), extending roughly between latitude 18

&rsquo; W, and ranging in elevation from sea level to 4,200 meters (m) (13,800 feet (ft)) (Dept. of Geography 1983).
The regional geological setting is a mid-oceanic volcanic island archipelago set in a roughly northwest to southeast
line, with younger islands to the southeast. The youngest island, Hawaii, is volcanically active. The older islands
are increasingly eroded, so that the basaltic portions of many of the northwesternmost islands (such as Laysan, Necker,
and Nihoa) are entirely submerged, and coralline atolls and shoals are often all that remain above sea level (Macdonald

. 1986). The topography of the Hawaiian Islands is extremely diverse. On the younger islands, Hawaii and Maui, gently
sloping unweathered shield volcanoes with very poor soil development are juxtaposed with older, heavily weathered
valleys with steep walls, well-developed streams, and gently sloped flood plains. The older islands to the northwest
(i.e., Niihau, Kauai, Oahu, and Molokai) are generally more weathered. On a typical older island, sea cliffs and large
amphitheater-headed valleys on the windward (northeast) side contrast with erosionally younger, dissected slopes
on the leeward (southwest) side (Dept. of Geography 1983). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The climate of the Hawaiian Islands reflects the tropical setting buffered by the surrounding ocean (Dept. of Geography
1983). The prevailing winds are northeast trades with some seasonal fluctuation in strength. There are also winter
storm systems and occasional hurricanes. Temperatures vary over the year on an average of 5
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; Celsius (C) (11
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; Fahrenheit (F)) or less, with daily variation usually exceeding seasonal variation in temperature. Temperature
varies with elevation and ranges from a maximum recorded temperature of 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
37.7
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; C (99.9
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->

<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
12.7
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; C (9.1
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; F) recorded at 4,205 m (13,795 ft) elevation. Annual rainfall varies greatly by location, with marked windward
to leeward gradients over short distances. Minimum average annual rainfall is less than 250 millimeters (mm) (10
inches (in)); the maximum average precipitation is well in excess of 11,000 mm (450 in) per year. Precipitation is
greatest during the months of October through April. A dry season is apparent in leeward settings, while windward
settings generally receive tradewind-driven rainfall throughout the year (Dept. of Geography 1983). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The native-dominated vegetation of the Hawaiian Islands varies greatly according to elevation, moisture regime,
and substrate. The most recent classification of Hawaiian natural communities recognizes nearly 100 native vegetation
types (Gagne and Cuddihy 1990). Within these types are numerous island-specific or region-specific associations,
comprising an extremely rich array of vegetation types within a very limited geographic area. Major vegetation formations
include forests, woodlands, shrublands, grasslands, herblands, and pioneer associations on lava and cinder substrates.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are lowland, montane, and subalpine forest types in Hawaii, extending from sea level to above 3,000 m (9,800
ft) in elevation. Coastal and lowland forests are generally dry or mesic and may be open- or closed-canopied. The stature
of lowland forests is generally under 10 m (30 ft). Eleven species included in this ruling (

Vigna o-wahuensis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) have been reported from lowland forest habitat. Montane forests, occupying elevations between 1,000 and 2,000
m (3,000 and 6,000 ft), are dry to mesic on the leeward slopes of the islands of Kauai, Maui, and Hawaii. On those islands,
as well as on Oahu, Molokai, and Lanai, mesic to wet montane forests occur on the windward slopes and summits. The dry
and mesic forests may be open- to closed-canopied, and may exceed 20 m (65 ft) in stature. Of the species in this ruling,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) have been reported from montane wet forest habitat. At high montane and subalpine elevations, at and above 2,000
m (6,500 ft) elevation, are subalpine forests, usually open-canopied and forming a mosaic with surrounding grasslands
and shrublands. Subalpine forests are known only from Haleakala on East Maui and from Hualalai, Mauna Kea, and Mauna
Loa on Hawaii.

Hawaiian shrublands are also found from coastal to alpine elevations. The majority of Hawaiian shrubland types are
in dry and mesic settings, or on cliffs and slopes too steep to support trees. Wet montane shrublands are typically
dominated by

, a member of the grammitis family (Grammitidaceae), is a small, pendant, epiphytic (not rooted on the ground) fern.
The rhizome (prostrate stem) is covered with small dark, stiff scales 2 to 4 centimeters (cm) (0.8 to 1.6 in) long. Its
yellowish green fronds are usually between 10 and 40 cm (4 and 16 in) long and covered with hairs. The fronds have slightly
hairy stalks less than 1 cm (0.4 in) long. Each frond is comprised of oblong or narrowly triangular pinnae (divisions
or leaflets) 5 to 15 mm (0.2 to 0.6 in) long with margins that are smooth or toothed and lined with sparse hairs. The pinnae
are situated perpendicular to the axis of the midrib, with each pinna twisted such that its upper surface faces upward.
Round sori (groups of spore-producing bodies) usually develop in the central portion of the fertile frond, forming
two regular rows on each pinna. This species differs from other species in this endemic Hawaiian genus by having hairs
along the pinna margins, pinnae at right angles to the midrib axis, by the placement of the sori, and the degree of dissection
of each pinna (Bishop 1970, 1974; Hillebrand 1888; Linney 1989).

, a member of the morning-glory family (Convolvulaceae), is a vine with twining branches up to 10 m (33 ft) long that
are fuzzy when young. The leathery, oblong to oval leaves measure 3 to 9 cm (1.2 to 3.5 in) in length and 1 to 4 cm (0.4 to
1.6 in) wide. The upper leaf surface is usually hairless or covered with sparse hairs and the lower surface is covered
with dense fuzzy hairs. The white to greenish funnel-shaped flowers, each 2 to 2.5 mm (0.08 to 0.1 in) long, are produced
singly or in clusters of three on stalks 1 to 2 cm (0.4 to 0.8 in) long with tiny bracts (modified leaves) at the base of
each stalk. Stamens usually have glandular hairs at their bases. The flower has two styles that are separate or partly
fused. The fruits are tan or yellowish brown capsules 1 to 1.5 cm (0.4 to 0.6 in) long that contain one or two oval seeds
imbedded in black pulp. This species is the only member of the genus that is endemic to the Hawaiian Islands and differs
from other genera in the family by its two styles, longer stems and petioles, and rounder leaves (Austin 1990).

Diellia erecta,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a member of the spleenwort family (Aspleniaceae), is a fern that grows in tufts of three to nine lance-shaped fronds,
each 20 to 70 cm (8 to 28 in) long. The fronds emerge from a 1 to 2.5 cm (0.4 to 1 in) long rhizome covered with brown to dark
gray scales. The frond stalks are reddish brown to black and smooth and glossy, 2 to 21 cm (0.8 to 8.3 in) long, and have
a few stiff scales at their bases. Each frond has 15 to 50 lance-shaped pinnae arranged oppositely along the midrib.
The pinnae are usually between 2 and 4 cm (0.8 and 1.6 in) long and 4 to 8 mm (0.2 to 0.3 in) wide. Ten to 20 sori, which may
be separate or fused, are borne on each margin of the pinna. Each sorus is covered by an indusium (protective membrane)
that falls short of the edge of the frond and runs parallel to the edge of each pinna. This species differs from other
members of the genus in having brown or dark gray scales usually more than 2 cm (0.8 in) in length, fused or separate sori
along both margins, shiny black midribs that have a hardened surface, and veins that do not usually encircle the sori
(Degener and Greenwell 1950, Hillebrand 1888, Robinson 1912, Smith 1934, Wagner 1952).

Makawao on State and private land (HHP 1992c4, 1992c5, 1992c7, 1992c13, 1992c17; HPCC 1990a; Joel Lau, HHP, and R.
Hobdy, pers. comms., 1992). On the island of Hawaii, there are 2 populations on State land: 1 at Honomalino with over
20 plants, and 1 at Manuka NAR with at least 1 plant (J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). Statewide, this species has a total of
13 populations and approximately 63 known individuals.

In 1912, Joseph F. Rock collected the first specimens of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Flueggea neowawraea
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (mehamehame) from Kapua on the island of Hawaii (Rock 1913). Based on his specimens, he established the monotypic
genus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Neowawraea,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 named for Dr. Heinrich W. Wawra, a colleague of Rock's. He named the species 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Neowawraea phyllanthoides
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because of its apparent resemblance to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Phyllanthus,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a member of the same family (Euphorbiaceae). Earl Edward Sherff (1939) later transferred the taxon to the genus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Drypetes.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 W. John Hayden (1987), upon further investigation, placed the species in the genus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Flueggea.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Because retention of the specific epithet would result in a later homonym, Hayden chose to maintain the tribute to
Wawra in the new epithet,

neowawraea.

Flueggea neowawraea,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a member of the spurge family (Euphorbiaceae), is a large tree up to 30 m (100 ft) tall and 2 m (7 ft) in diameter with white
oblong pores covering its scaly, pale brown bark. The thin, papery, oval leaves, 4 to 14 cm (1.5 to 5.5 in) long and 2 to
9 cm (0.8 to 3.5 in) wide, are green on the upper surface and pale green on the lower surface. Plants are usually dioecious
(having separate male and female plants) with unisexual flowers lacking petals. Male flowers, on stalks less than
4 mm (0.2 in) long, have five green sepals with brownish tips. The female flowers, on stalks 1 to 2.5 mm (0.04 to 0.1 in)
long, have sepals of unequal length with irregular margins. The two-lobed stigma is positioned atop a 2.5 to 3 mm (0.1
in) long, round ovary with a nectary disk. The fleshy, round fruits, about 5 mm (0.2 in) in diameter, are reddish brown
to black and contain two slightly curved seeds about 3 mm (0.1 in) long that are somewhat triangular in cross section.
This species is the only member of the genus found in Hawaii and can be distinguished from other species in the genus
by its large size; scaly bark; the shape, size, and color of the leaves; flowers clustered along the branches; and the
size and shape of the fruits (Hayden 1990, Linney 1982, Neal 1965).

(HHP 1992d17, 1992d18, 1992d30 to 1992d32; HPCC 1990b; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). Also, three individuals (some
of which may be dead) are known from the two adjacent valleys of Mahanaloa and Paaiki, near Makaha Point, on State-owned
land (HHP 1992d9, 1992d13). Only one unhealthy individual is known from Limahuli Valley on privately owned land (HHP
1992d17). One tree is known from Kalalau and 10 from Pohakuao on State-owned land (J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). Sixteen
trees are known from the Poomau branch of Waimea Canyon, and 40 to 80 individuals are known from 4 scattered populations
along the Koaie branch of Waimea Canyon on State-owned land (HHP 1992d18, 1992d30, 1992d31; HPCC 1990b; J. Lau, pers.

 is currently known from 15 locations with approximately 33 individuals in the Waianae Mountains. The populations
are spread from East Kapuahikahi Gulch to Puumaialau Gulch over a distance of about 15.5 km (9.6 mi) on Federal, State,
County, and private land (HHP 1992d1 to 1992d4, 1992d6 to 1992d8, 1992d11, 1992d12, 1992d14 to 1992d16, 1992d19,
1992d20, 1992d24, 1992d26, 1992d29; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). On East Maui, one or two individuals are known from
Auwahi on the southwest slope of Haleakala at approximately 850 m (2,800 ft) elevation on privately owned land (HHP
1992d23). Five populations are known from the island of Hawaii in South Kona and Kau, extending over an area of about
10 by 5 km (6 by 3 mi) from Papa to Manuka, and numbering approximately 20 individuals, on State and private land (HHP
1992d21, 1992d22, 1992d27, 1992d28, 1992d34, 1992d35; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1990). A Hawaii Island population on
private land at Huehue Ranch in North Kona consists of an unknown number of individuals (Hayden 1990). Statewide,
the species totals 28 populations containing approximately 127 to 167 known individuals.

 plants. Other major threats include habitat degradation by feral and wild ungulates (pigs, goats, deer, and cattle),
competition with alien plant species, and fire. The small number of individuals within any population and the scattered
distribution of populations, compounded by a requirement for cross-pollination because the species is dioecious,
must be considered a serious threat.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hibiscus brackenridgei, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a member of the mallow family (Malvaceae), is a sprawling to erect shrub or small tree up to 5 m (16 ft) tall. Most plant
parts (young branches, leaves, and some flower parts) vary in the degree of hairiness. The leaves, about 5 to 15 cm (2
to 6 in) long and equally wide, have three to seven lobes but are generally heart-shaped in outline. Beneath each leaf
stalk is a pair of very thin stipules (leaf-like appendages), 5 to 15 mm (0.2 to 0.6 in) long, that fall off early in development,
leaving an elliptic scar. Flowers are borne singly or in small clusters. The petals, between 3.5 and 8 cm (1.4 and 3.1
in) long, are yellow, usually with a maroon spot in the center of the flower. Each triangular calyx lobe is reddish to
yellow, and usually has a raised, elongated gland on the midrib. Seven to 10 bracts are attached below the calyx. The
staminal column, which has anthers attached to the upper three-fourths or nearly to the base, extends beyond the petals.
The fruits are somewhat round or oval capsules 1.1 to 2 cm (0.4 to 0.8 in) long that have a beak-like appendage at one end.
This species differs from other members of the genus in having the following combination of characteristics: yellow
petals, a calyx comprised of triangular lobes with raised veins and a single midrib often bearing a prominent elongated
gland, 7 to 10 bracts attached below the calyx, and thin stipules 5 to 15 mm (0.2 to 0.6 in) long that fall off, leaving
an elliptic scar (Bates 1990).

Mariscus pennatiformis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(NCN), a member of the sedge family (Cyperaceae), is a perennial plant with a woody root system covered with brown scales.
The stout, smooth, three-angled stems are between 0.4 and 1.2 m (1.3 and 4 ft) long, slightly concave and 3 to 7 mm (0.1
to 0.3 in) in diameter in the lower part. The three to five linear, somewhat leathery leaves are 8 to 17 mm (0.3 to 0.7 in)
wide and at least as long as the stem. Each flower cluster, umbrella-shaped and moderately dense, is 4 to 15 cm (1.5 to
6 in) long and 5 to 25 cm (2 to 10 in) wide. About 5 to 18 spikes, comprised of numerous spikelets, form each cluster. Each
spikelet, measuring about 8 to 14 mm (0.3 to 0.6 in) in length, is yellowish brown or grayish brown and is comprised of
8 to 25 densely arranged flowers. The glumes (bracts beneath each flower), which are less than twice as long as wide,
are spreading and overlap tightly. The lowest glume does not overlap the base of the uppermost glume. This species
differs from other members of the genus by its three-sided, slightly concave, smooth stems; the length and number
of spikelets; the leaf width; and the length and diameter of stems. The two subspecies are distinguished primarily
by larger and more numerous spikelets, larger achenes (dry, one-seeded fruits), and more overlapping and yellower
glumes in ssp.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a member of the nettle family (Urticaceae), is a 3 to 5 m (10 to 16 ft) tall shrub with densely hairy branches. The elliptic
or oval leaves are between 4.3 and 13 cm (1.7 and 5.1 in) long and have smooth margins or slightly toothed margins on young
leaves. The upper leaf surface is moderately hairy and the lower leaf surface is densely covered with irregularly
curved, silky gray to white hairs up to 1 mm (0.04 in) long along the veins. The male flowers may be stalkless or have short
stalks. The female flowers are stalkless and have a densely hairy calyx that is either toothed, collar-like, or divided
into narrow unequal segments. The fruits are 1 mm (0.04 in) long achenes with the apical section separated from the
basal portion by a deep constriction. Seeds are oval with a constriction across the upper half.

Plantago princeps, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a member of the plantain family (Plantaginaceae), is a small shrub or robust perennial herb. Its erect or ascending
stems are hollow, about 2 to 250 cm (1 to 100 in) long, and often branched with young internodes that are more or less woolly
with reddish brown hairs. The oblong to elliptic, thick, leathery leaves are between 6 and 30 cm (2.4 and 12 in) long
and up to 5 cm (2 in) wide and are tufted near the ends of stems. The leaves have smooth or minutely toothed margins, a pointed
tip, and primary veins that converge at the base of the leaves. Numerous stalkless flowers are densely arranged in
a cluster 11 to 28 cm (4.3 to 11 in) long with each cluster on a stalk 10 to 50 cm (4 to 20 in) long. Each flower spreads at an
angle of nearly 90 degrees to the axis of the stalk or grows upright. The sepals are somewhat distinct and elliptic in
shape. The fruits are capsules that contain three or four tiny black seeds; the surface of the seeds is apparently covered
with a sticky membrane. This species differs from other native members of the genus in Hawaii by its large branched
stems, flowers at nearly right angles to the axis of the flower cluster, and fruits that break open at a point two-thirds
from the base. The four varieties (

, a member of the pea family (Fabaceae), is typically a sprawling shrub with branches up to 14 m (45 ft) long but may also
be a small tree up to 6 m (20 ft) in height. Each compound leaf is comprised of 18 to 38 oblong to elliptic leaflets, each
15 to 38 mm (0.6 to 1.5 in) long and 5 to 18 mm (0.2 to 0.7 in) wide, and is usually sparsely to densely covered with silky
hairs. The flowers, in clusters of two to nine, are salmon tinged with yellow, orange-red, or scarlet, or rarely pure
yellow. The petals are between 23 and 45 mm (0.9 and 1.8 in) long, the upper pair sometimes of a lighter color than the
other petals. The calyx is about 7 to 12 mm (0.3 to 0.5 in) long. Fruits are slightly flattened pods 7 to 23 cm (2.8 to 9 in)
long and about 5 mm (0.2 in) wide that contain about 6 to 27 olive to pale or dark brown, oblong seeds.

Solanum incompletum, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae), is a woody shrub up to 3 m (10 ft) tall. Its stems and lower leaf surfaces
are covered with prominent reddish prickles about 4 mm (0.2 in) long or sometimes with yellow fuzzy hairs on young plant
parts and lower leaf surfaces. The oval to elliptic leaves, 10 to 15 cm (4 to 6 in) long and about 7 cm (2.8 in) wide, have
prominent veins on the lower surface, and are on stalks up to 7 cm (2.8 in) long. The leaf margins are lobed with one to
four lobes on each side. Numerous flowers grow in loose branching clusters with each flower on a stalk about 9 mm (0.4
in) long. The calyx and flowers generally lack prickles. The white petals form a star-shaped corolla about 2 cm (0.8
in) in diameter. The curved anthers, about 2 mm (0.08 in) long, top short filaments that do not extend beyond the petals.
Fruits are round berries about 1.5 cm (0.6 in) in diameter that mature from yellow-orange to black. This species differs
from others in the genus by being generally prickly and having loosely clustered white flowers, curved anthers about
2 mm (0.08 in) long, and berries 1 to 2 cm (0.4 to 0.8 in) in diameter (Symon 1990).

Spermolepis hawaiiensis, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a member of the parsley family (Apiaceae), is a slender annual herb with few branches that grows to a height of 5 to 20
cm (2 to 8 in). Its leaves, dissected into narrow, lance-shaped divisions, are oblong to somewhat oval in outline and
grow on stalks about 2.5 cm (1 in) long. Flowers are arranged in a loose, compound umbrella-shaped inflorescence arising
from the stem, opposite the leaves. Each cluster consists of two to six flowers, with each flower on a stalk between
2 and 6 mm (0.08 and 0.2 in) long. The calyx is lacking in this species, but one to five bracts grow below the clusters of
flowers. The fruits are oval and laterally compressed and constricted at the line where the two halves of the fruit
meet. The fruits are 4 mm (0.2 in) long and 3 mm (0.1 in) wide, covered with curved bristles, and contain seeds that are
marked with longitudinal grooves beneath oil tubes that are characteristic of the parsley family.

1993). Currently, six populations are known on Oahu, Molokai, Lanai, and West Maui; one additional population may
exist on Hawaii. On Oahu, on State land at Diamond Head (land leased to the Department of Defense at the Diamond Head
Reservation), 10 plants were observed in 1992 during the dry season. In 1988, when the site was first visited, thousands
of plants were seen over an area less than 50 sq m (several hundred sq ft) (Wayne Takeuchi, DOFAW, pers. comm., 1992).
The population fluctuations probably reflect seasonal changes in precipitation. On Molokai, about 600 plants were
reported from Kamalo on private land within an area of less than 400 sq m (0.1 ac) (HHP 1992L6). On Lanai, 2 populations
of

an area of about 0.1 ha (0.25 ac) (HHP 1992L7; R. Hobdy, pers. comm., 1992). On West Maui, 3 populations are known on State
land: 1 in the Lihau section of the West Maui NAR, with 60 to 100 individuals within an area of about 0.4 ha (1 ac); 1 further
east in the Lihau section of the West Maui NAR, with several hundred plants scattered over a distance of 0.7 km (0.4 mi);
and 1 above Lahainaluna School, with several hundred individuals spread over an area of about 0.4 ha (1 ac) (HHP 1992L1,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, a member of the pea family, is a slender twining annual or perennial herb with fuzzy stems that grows to 0.4 m (1.3 ft)
in length. Each leaf is made up of three leaflets that vary in shape from round to linear, are 1.2 to 8 cm (0.5 to 3 in) long
and 0.1 to 2.5 cm (0.04 to 1 in) wide, and are sparsely or moderately covered with coarse hairs. Flowers, in clusters
of one to four, have thin, translucent, pale yellow or greenish yellow petals about 2 to 2.5 cm (0.8 to 1 in) long. The
two lowermost petals are fused and appear distinctly beaked. The sparsely hairy calyx is 4 to 8 mm (0.2 to 0.3 in) long
with asymmetrical lobes that measure about 3 mm (0.1 in) long. The fruits are long slender pods 4 to 9 cm (1.6 to 3.5 in)
long and about 5 mm (0.2 in) wide, that may or may not be slightly inflated and contain 7 to 15 gray to black seeds less than
6 mm (0.2 in) long. This species differs from others in the genus by its thin yellowish petals, sparsely hairy calyx,
and thin pods which may or may not be slightly inflated (Geesink

On July 1, 1975, the Service published a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (40 FR 27823) of its acceptance of the Smithsonian report as a petition within the context of section 4(c)(2) (now section
4(b)(3)) of the Act, and giving notice of its intention to review the status of the plant taxa named therein. As a result
of that review, on June 16, 1976, the Service published a proposed rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (41 FR 24523) to determine endangered status pursuant to section 4 of the Act for approximately 1,700 vascular plant
species, including all of the above taxa considered to be endangered or thought to be extinct, plus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Diellia erecta 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

(considered threatened). The list of 1,700 plant taxa was assembled on the basis of comments and data received by the
Smithsonian Institution and the Service in response to House Document No. 94&hyph;51 and the July 1, 1975, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

General comments received in response to the 1976 proposal are summarized in an April 26, 1978,

 publication (43 FR 17909). In 1978, amendments to the Act required that all proposals over 2 years old be withdrawn.
A 1-year grace period was given to proposals already over 2 years old. On December 10, 1979, the Service published a
notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (44 FR 70796) withdrawing the portion of the June 16, 1976, proposal that had not been made final, including the above
taxa, along with four other proposals that had expired. The Service published updated notices of review for plants
on December 15, 1980 (45 FR 82479), September 27, 1985 (50 FR 39525), and February 21, 1990 (55 FR 6183). In these notices,
11 of the taxa (including synonymous taxa) that had been in the 1976 proposed rule were treated as category 1 candidates
for Federal listing. Category 1 taxa are those for which the Service has on file substantial information on biological
vulnerability and threats to support preparation of listing proposals. Other than

but for which there are not enough data to support listing proposals at the time. Category 3A taxa are those for which
the Service has persuasive evidence of extinction. Through taxonomic revisions, each of the category 1*, 2, and 3A
taxa were synonymized under category 1 taxa on the 1990 list.

Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act requires the Secretary to make findings on petitions that present substantial information
indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted within 12 months of their receipt. Section 2(b)(1) of the 1982
amendments further requires all petitions pending on October 13, 1982, be treated as having been newly submitted
on that date. On October 13, 1983, the Service found that the petitioned listing of these species was warranted, but
precluded by other pending listing actions, in accordance with section 4(b)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act; notification
of this finding was published on January 20, 1984 (49 FR 2485). Such a finding requires the Service to consider the petition
as having been resubmitted, pursuant to section 4(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Act. The findings were reviewed in October of
1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1991. The proposed rule published on September 14, 1993 (58 FR 48012)
to list 12 species of plants from the Hawaiian Islands as endangered species constituted the final 1-year finding
that was required for these species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on comments and recommendations received in response to the proposal (see Comments and Recommendations, below),
the Service now determines these 12 plant species to be endangered with the publication of this final rule.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the September 14, 1993, proposed rule and associated notifications, all interested parties were requested to
submit factual reports or information that might contribute to the development of a final rule. The public comment
period ended on November 15, 1993. Appropriate State agencies, county governments, Federal agencies, scientific
organizations, and other interested parties were contacted and requested to comment. Newspaper notices inviting
public comment were published in ``The Maui News'' on October 7, 1993, the ``Hawaii Tribune-Herald'' on October 8,
1993, and the ``Honolulu Advertiser'' on October 7, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments were received from three parties: One from an individual in support of the listing of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Spermolepis hawaiiensis,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Spermolepis hawaiiensis, Adenophorus periens 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Adenophorus periens
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sesbania tomentosa
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park is more than 50; the third respondent provided information on three previously
unknown populations of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sesbania tomentosa,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 one from the south coast of East Maui and two from the northwest coast of the island of Hawaii. The information provided
by these respondents has been incorporated into this final rule. The information received does not indicate that
any of these species are under less threat than previously thought.

Section 4 of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1533) and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement
the Act set forth the procedures for adding species to the Federal lists of endangered and threatened species. A species
may be determined to be an endangered or threatened species due to one or more of the five factors described in section
4(a)(1). The threats facing these 12 species are summarized in Table 2.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Native vegetation on all of the main Hawaiian Islands has undergone extreme alteration because of past and present
land management practices including ranching, deliberate alien animal and plant introductions, and agricultural
development (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Wagner 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1985). The Northwestern Hawaiian Islands have undergone similar alteration, but to a lesser degree. The primary
threats facing the 12 plant species included in this ruling are ongoing and threatened destruction and adverse modification
of habitat by feral animals and competition with alien plants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eleven of the 12 species in this ruling are variously threatened by feral animals. (See Table 2.) Animals such as pigs,
goats, axis deer, black-tailed deer, and cattle were introduced either by the early Hawaiians (pigs) or more recently
by European settlers (all ungulate species) for food and/or commercial ranching activities. Over the 200 years following
their introduction, their numbers increased and the adverse impacts of feral ungulates on native vegetation have
become increasingly apparent. Beyond the direct effect of trampling and grazing native plants, feral ungulates
have contributed significantly to the heavy erosion still taking place on most of the main Hawaiian islands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pigs (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sus scrofa
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), originally native to Europe, Africa, and Asia, were introduced to Hawaii by the Polynesian ancestors of Hawaiians,
and later by western immigrants. The pigs escaped domestication and invaded primarily wet and mesic forests and grasslands
of Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Maui, and Hawaii. They presently threaten the existence of at least eight of the taxa in those
habitats. While foraging, pigs root and trample the forest floor, encouraging the establishment of alien plants
in the newly disturbed soil. Pigs also disseminate alien plant seeds through their feces and on their bodies, accelerating
the spread of alien plants through native forest (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Stone 1985). On Kauai, three populations
each of

Capra hircus

), native to the Middle East and India, were first successfully introduced to the Hawaiian Islands in 1792. Feral goats
now occupy a wide variety of habitats from lowland dry forests to montane grasslands on Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Maui,
and Hawaii, where they consume native vegetation, trample roots and seedlings, accelerate erosion, and promote
the invasion of alien plants (Stone 1985, van Riper and van Riper 1982). Goats are significantly degrading the habitat
of at least five species in this rule. On Kauai, goats contribute to the substantial decline of one population of

 (HHP 1992d18, 1992d30, 1992d31, 1992i2; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). On Oahu, encroaching urbanization and hunting
pressure tend to concentrate the goat population in the dry upper slopes of the Waianae Mountains, where one population
of

 exist (HHP 1992d15; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). The goat population in the Waianae area is apparently increasing,
becoming an even greater threat to the rare plants that grow there. On Molokai, two populations of

 at Makolelau are presently threatened by goats (HHP 1992c12, 1992c13; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). Until a few years
ago, feral goats were a major threat to rare plants in Haleakala National Park on East Maui, but because of an active
ungulate control program, the goat population was reduced to 100 by 1988. While they are no longer a significant threat,
the future ingress and reestablishment of goats are still a possibility (Lloyd Loope, National Park Service (NPS),
pers. comm., 1992) and could potentially affect the three populations of

Eight individuals of axis deer (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Axis axis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), introduced to the island of Molokai in 1868, increased to thousands of animals within about 30 years (Tomich 1986).
By the turn of the century, the herds so damaged the vegetation of Molokai that professional hunters were hired to control
their numbers (Tomich 1986). By then, the native vegetation had suffered irreparable damage from overgrazing by
axis deer. They degrade the habitat by trampling and overgrazing vegetation, which removes ground cover and exposes
the soil to erosion (J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). Activity of deer on Molokai has resulted in loss of habitat and/or individuals
of at least six of the species. In the absence of a protective fence, axis deer continue to invade the unfenced areas
and threaten to trample the plants. On both Molokai and Lanai, the axis deer populations are presently actively managed
for recreational hunting by the Hawaii State Department of Land and Natural Resources. Extensive red erosional scars
caused by decades of deer activity are evident on Lanai. The habitat of three Lanai populations of

The Nature Conservancy of Hawaii (TNCH) is presently erecting fenced exclosures to protect populations of rare taxa
(including two populations of

) that occur within Kanepuu Preserve (Heidi Bornhorst, TNCH, and J. Lau, pers. comms., 1992). Although the fence is
high enough to normally inhibit entry by deer, human pressure can force the deer to jump over the fence. On Maui, deer

The deer are presently confined to the western side of the island, where they feed on a variety of native and alien plants
(van Riper and van Riper 1982). On Kauai, one population of

Large-scale ranching of cattle (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Bos taurus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) in the Hawaiian Islands began in the middle of the 19th century on the islands of Kauai, Oahu, Maui, and Hawaii. Large
ranches, tens of thousands of acres in size, developed on East Maui and Hawaii (Cuddihy and Stone 1990) where most of
the State's large ranches still exist today. Degradation of native forests used for ranching activities became evident
soon after full-scale ranching began. The negative impact of cattle on Hawaii's ecosystem is similar to that described
for goats and deer (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Stone 1985). Cattle grazing continues in several lowland regions in the
northern portion of the Waianae Mountains of Oahu: in Lualualei, where one population of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Bonamia menziesii 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
exists, and in Kaumoku Gulch, where one population of

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
remains (HHP 1992b30; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). On Molokai, cattle ranching is slowly recovering from setbacks
caused by recent herd reductions enforced in an effort to eliminate bovine tuberculosis from domestic and feral stock.
As cattle ranching becomes reestablished on Molokai and the number of cattle increases, the threat to the rare plant
species that remain in those ranching areas will also likely increase. One population of

Sesbania tomentosa

on the west and southwest slopes of East Maui and in lowland regions of West Maui. On both East and West Maui, one or more
populations of

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
populations grow within a fenced exclosure. Although probably minimal, the possibility of cattle entering the exclosure
poses a potential threat. In the Kamaoa-Puueo and South Point regions of the island of Hawaii, cattle continue to graze
in habitat currently occupied by most of the populations of

Habitat disturbance caused by human activities threatens two of the taxa. On West Maui, all-terrain vehicles have
driven over

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sesbania tomentosa 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
plants growing west of Nakalele Point lighthouse (HHP 1992j43). Continued off-road activity threatens to destroy
a significant portion of that population. On the island of Hawaii, a dirt road runs through a population of

Sesbania tomentosa 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
located in the Kamaoa-Puueo region (HHP 1992j50). Off-road activity could damage a significant portion of that population
as well. In the Puu Anahulu region on that island, a ranch road was bulldozed close to a plant of

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Evidence of predation on two of the taxa by ungulates (cattle, deer, goats) is documented on Oahu, Lanai, and Maui.
On Oahu, plants of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

for cattle to feed on the plants (HHP 1992b30). On Lanai, axis deer are known to feed on this species, especially at Kanepuu.
Depredation of

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
by goats has been observed on Lanai and Maui. Goats are known to eat the branch tips and strip the bark of the plants (HHP
1992e14). While there is no evidence of predation on the other 11 species, none of them are known to be unpalatable to
cattle, deer, or goats. Predation is therefore a probable threat to species growing at sites where those animals have
been reported (

Many noxious alien plants such as Christmasberry have invaded the dry to mesic lowland regions of the Hawaiian Islands.
Introduced to Hawaii before 1911, Christmasberry forms dense thickets that shade out and displace other plants (Cuddihy
and Stone 1990). This fast-growing species is found in lowland areas of the major Hawaiian Islands (Smith 1985) and
is currently expanding its range. Christmasberry is a major component of the mesic forests of the Waianae and Koolau
Mountains of Oahu. For example, over half of the populations of

Strawberry guava, an invasive shrub or small tree native to tropical America, has become naturalized on all of the
main Hawaiian islands. Like Christmasberry, strawberry guava is capable of forming dense stands that exclude other
plant species (Cuddihy and Stone 1990) and is dispersed mainly by feral pigs and fruit-eating birds (Smith 1985).
This alien plant grows primarily in mesic and wet habitats and provides food for several alien animal species, including
feral pigs and game birds, which disperse the plant's seeds through the forest (Smith 1985, Wagner

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

to pose a direct threat to at least one population of

First introduced to the Hawaiian Islands as cattle fodder, molasses grass was later planted for erosion control (Cuddihy
and Stone 1990). This alien grass quickly spread to dry and mesic forests previously disturbed by ungulates. Molasses
grass produces a dense mat capable of smothering plants (Smith 1985), essentially preventing seedling growth and
native plant reproduction (Cuddihy and Stone 1990). Because it burns readily and often grows at the border of forests,
molasses grass tends to carry fire into areas with woody native plants (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Smith 1985). It is able
to spread prolifically after a fire and effectively compete with less fire-adapted native plant species, ultimately
creating a stand of alien grass where forest once stood. Molasses grass is becoming a major threat to seven of the species
on four islands. In the Waianae Mountains of Oahu, three populations of

Koster's curse, a noxious shrub native to tropical America, was first reported on Oahu in 1941. It had spread through
much of the Koolau Mountains by the early 1960s, and spread to the Waianae Mountains by 1970 (Cuddihy and Stone 1990).
It poses a serious threat to two populations of

Lantana, a native of the West Indies, became naturalized in dry to mesic forests and shrublands of the Hawaiian Islands
before 1871 (Cuddihy and Stone 1990). This shrub often forms thick cover and produces chemicals that inhibit the growth
of other plant species (Smith 1985). On Kauai, lantana is a major component of the vegetation at Paaiki Valley and Waimea
Canyon and is rapidly becoming established in Pohakuao. It poses a threat to populations of

A vine in the passionflower family, banana poka was introduced to the islands in the 1920s, probably as an ornamental.
This vine is extremely detrimental to certain wet forest habitats of Kauai, Maui, and Hawaii. Heavy growth of this
vine can cause damage or death to the native trees by overloading branches, causing breakage, or by forming a dense
canopy cover, intercepting sunlight and shading out native plants below. An infestation of this vine is located at
Olaa Tract on the island of Hawaii, the site of one population of

A recent introduction to the Hawaiian Islands, yellow Himalayan raspberry is rapidly becoming a major weed pest in
wet forests, pastures, and other open areas on the island of Hawaii. It forms large thorny thickets and displaces native
plants. Its ability to invade the understory of wet forests enables it to fill a niche presently unoccupied by any other
major wet forest weed in Hawaii. This has resulted in an extremely rapid population expansion of this alien plant in
recent years. One population of

The small number of populations and of individual plants of six of these species (

) increases the potential for extinction from stochastic events. The limited gene pool may depress reproductive
vigor, or a single human-caused or natural environmental disturbance could destroy a significant percentage of
the individuals or the only known extant population. For example, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Solanum incompletum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is known from a single population on the island of Hawaii and numbers only two individuals. Two of the species have fewer
than 5 populations and 6 of the species are estimated to number no more than 100 individuals (See Table 2). All of the
species in this ruling except 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sesbania tomentosa
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 either number fewer than 20 populations or total fewer than 200 individuals. The reproductive system of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Flueggia neowawraea
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 further exacerbates the problem of limited numbers. Since each tree bears only male or female flowers, they must be
cross-pollinated from a different tree (Hayden 1990). If only a few trees flower at the same time, or if flowering trees
are too widely separated for pollination by insects, no seed will be set. The survival of small, isolated populations,
which probably are already experiencing depressed reproductive vigor, is therefore further threatened.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past,
present, and future threats faced by these species in determining to make this rule final. Based on this evaluation,
this rulemaking will list these 12 species as endangered: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Adenophorus periens, Bonamia menziesii, Diellia erecta, Flueggea neowawraea, Hibiscus brackenridgei, Mariscus
pennatiformis, Neraudia sericea, Plantago princeps, Sesbania tomentosa, Solanum incompletum, Spermolepis hawaiiensis,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Vigna o-wahuensis.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 These 12 species are threatened by one or more of the following: habitat degradation and/or predation by pigs, goats,
deer, and cattle; competition for space, light, water, and nutrients by alien plants; habitat loss from fires; human
impacts from recreational activities; and insect infestations. Six of the 12 species either number no more than about
100 individuals or are known from fewer than 5 populations. Small population size and limited distribution make all
of these species particularly vulnerable to extinction from reduced reproductive vigor or from stochastic events.
Because these 12 species are in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of their ranges, they
fit the definition of endangered as defined in the Act. Therefore, the determination of endangered status for these
12 species is warranted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Critical habitat is not being proposed for the 12 species included in this rule, for reasons discussed in the ``Critical
Habitat'' section of this rule.

Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary
designate critical habitat at the time the species are determined to be endangered or threatened. The Service finds
that designation of critical habitat is not presently prudent for these species. Such a determination would result
in no known benefit to the species. The species have low total populations and/or numbers of individuals and face anthropogenic
threats. The publication of precise maps and descriptions of critical habitat in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, as required for the designation of critical habitat, would increase the degree of threat to these plants from take
or vandalism and could contribute to their decline. The listing of these species under the Act publicizes the rarity
of the plants and, thus, can make these plants attractive to researchers, curiosity seekers, or collectors of rare
plants. All involved parties and the major landowners have been notified. Protection of the habitat of the species
will be addressed through the recovery process and through the section 7 consultation process. Therefore, the Service
finds that designation of critical habitat for these species is not prudent at this time, because such designation
would increase the degree of threat from vandalism, collecting, or other human activities and because it is unlikely
to aid in the conservation of these species.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act include
recognition, recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain activities.
Listing can encourage and result in conservation actions by Federal, State, and local agencies, and private organizations
and individuals. The Endangered Species Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with the State
and requires that recovery plans be developed for listed species. The requirements for Federal agencies and the prohibitions
against certain activities involving listed plants are discussed, in part, below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species
that is proposed or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated.
Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR Part 402. Section
7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to insure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize
the continued existence of a listed species or to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action
may affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency must enter into consultation
with the Service.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Spermolepis hawaiiensis

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is located in Diamond Head Reservation, leased by the Department of Defense. Portions of Makua Military Reservation
are used by the Army and other branches of the military for ordnance training. The two species are not located inside
the impact areas or adjacent buffer zones and, thus, are not directly affected by military activities. The Army has
constructed firebreaks on the Makua Military Reservation to minimize damage from unintentional fires that occasionally
result from the use of ordnance (Herve Messier, U.S. Army, Ft. Shafter, pers. comm., 1990). Plants of

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Vigna o-wahuensis,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 grows on the previously federally owned island of Kahoolawe where the Federal government is involved with ordnance
disposal. Although periodic detonation of ordnance is required on the island, the populations of this species found
there are at sites too remote to sustain impacts from such detonation (J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). There are no other
known Federal activities that occur within the presently known habitat of these 12 plant species.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act and implementing regulations at 50 CFR 17.61, 17.62, and 17.63 set forth a series of general prohibitions and
exceptions that apply to all endangered plant species. With respect to the 12 plant species subject to this final rule,
all prohibitions of section 9(a)(2) of the Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.61 apply. These prohibitions, in part, make
it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to import or export any endangered plant
species to/from the United States; transport such species in interstate or foreign commerce in the course of a commercial
activity; sell or offer for sale such species in interstate or foreign commerce; remove and reduce to possession any
such species from areas under Federal jurisdiction; maliciously damage or destroy any such species on any area under
Federal jurisdiction; or remove, cut, dig up, damage, or destroy any such species on any other area in knowing violation
of any State law or regulation or in the course of any violation of a State criminal trespass law. Certain exceptions
apply to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies. Section 10 of the Act and 50 CFR 17.62 provide for the
issuance of permits under certain circumstances to carry out activities involving endangered plants that are otherwise
prohibited by section 9. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the policy of the Service (59 FR 34272) to identify to the maximum extent practicable at the time a species is listed
those activities that would or would not be likely to constitute a violation of section 9 of the Act. Such information
is intended to clarify the potential impacts of a species' listing on proposed and ongoing activities within the species'
range. Seven of the twelve species in this rule are known to occur on lands under the jurisdiction of the Fish and Wildlife
Service, National Park Service or Department of Defense. Collection, damage or destruction of these species on these
lands is prohibited without a Federal endangered species permit. Such activities on non-Federal lands would constitute
a violation of section 9 if conducted in knowing violation of Hawaii State law or regulations or in violation of State
criminal trespass law (see Hawaii State Law section below). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two of the listed species are of horticultural interest and both are currently in commercial trade. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Hibiscus brackenridgei 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
is a very attractive member of a genus known for its immense horticultural popularity and is the official State flower
of Hawaii. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sesbania tomentosa 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
also is an exceptionally attractive species that grows well in low elevation urban areas. Intrastate commerce (commerce
within a State) is not prohibited under the Act. However, interstate and foreign commerce (sale or offering for sale
across State or international boundaries), will require a Federal endangered species permit. (Endangered species
may be advertised for sale provided the advertisement contains a statement that no sale may be consummated until a
permit has been obtained from the Service.) Other than possible interstate commerce, the Service is not aware of any
other activities being conducted by the public that will be affected by this listing and result in a violation of section
9. Questions regarding whether specific activities will constitute a violation of section 9 should be directed to
the Field Supervisor of the Service's Pacific Islands Office (see

section). Requests for copies of the regulations concerning listed plants and general inquiries regarding prohibitions
and permits may be addressed to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Ecological Services, Endangered Species Permits,

Federal listing would automatically invoke listing under Hawaii State law. Hawaii's Endangered Species Act (HRS,
Sect. 195D&hyph;4(a)) states, ``Any species of aquatic life, wildlife, or land plant that has been determined to
be an endangered species pursuant to the [Federal] Endangered Species Act shall be deemed to be an endangered species
under the provisions of this chapter and any indigenous species of aquatic life, wildlife, or land plant that has been
determined to be a threatened species pursuant to the [Federal] Endangered Species Act shall be deemed to be a threatened
species under the provisions of this chapter.'' The State law prohibits cutting, collecting, uprooting, destroying,
injuring, or possessing any listed species of plant, or attempting to engage in any such conduct. The State law also
encourages conservation by State agencies and triggers other State regulations to protect the species (HRS, sect.
195&hyph;4 and 5). The State may enter into agreements with Federal agencies to administer and manage any area required
for the conservation, management, enhancement, or protection of endangered species (HRS, Sect. 195D&hyph;5(c)).

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule makes several changes in the interim rule for the Section 5(h) Homeownership Program for Public and
Indian Housing. It responds to the public comments received on the interim rule that was published September 20, 1991,
incorporating a few substantive modifications, as well as some clarifications and editorial revisions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule provides separate regulatory codifications of the Section 5(h) Homeownership Program for public housing
and for Indian housing, as appropriate for each. For Indian Housing Authorities (IHAs), the rule consists of subpart
P of the Consolidated Program Regulations for Indian Housing (24 CFR Part 905); for Public Housing Agencies (PHAs),
24 CFR Part 906. The language of these two versions is identical, excepting only appropriate distinctions in terminology
and phrasing, and in references to applicable Federal statutes and regulations on nondiscrimination and civil rights.
In general, the Section 5(h) Homeownership Program works the same way for both PHAs and IHAs.

The interim rule for the Section 5(h) Homeownership Program for Public and Indian Housing was published September
20, 1991 (56 FR 47852), with an effective date of October 21, 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Comments were received from 10 commenters, including six Public Housing Agencies (PHAs), one national association
of PHAs, two legal services organizations, and one private consultant. All comments have been considered, as indicated
by the discussion below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Because the texts of the IHA rule (Part 905, subpart P) and the PHA rule (Part 906) follow a parallel format, with provisions
that are substantially the same, the following discussion applies to both, except where noted. In most instances,
dual section references are cited, with the section of the IHA regulation followed by the corresponding section of
the PHA regulation, e.g., &sect;&sect;905.1001/906.1 through 905.1021/906.21. Except where differences in the
IHA and PHA versions are indicated, the term ``Housing Authority (HA)'' is used in the following discussion as a common
term of reference to both PHAs and IHAs.

In General: The Flexibility Issue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The extent to which the regulation should allow flexibility for Housing Authorities (HAs) and residents in the design
of their local homeownership plans was the subject of greatest concern to the commenters. While a number of comments
addressed this issue in the context of specific provisions of the regulation, as discussed below, some urged that
the regulation as a whole afford the maximum flexibility permitted by the statute, pointing out that the statutory
authorities for this program_Sections 5(h) and 6(c)(4)(D) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (Act)_are clearly
intended to authorize a high degree of local discretion. Some other commenters, however, argued for a more restrictive
approach, suggesting that local discretion be curtailed and regulatory requirements be more rigidly detailed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The changes that are incorporated in the final rule move in the direction of more local flexibility, as explained in
the section-by-section analysis below. The overall approach is deliberately brief and simple, limited to a basic
regulatory framework of essential standards and procedures. No attempt is made to specify the details of everything
that might possibly be required or permitted in all the variety of local situations. Anything not specifically prohibited
is permissible, if consistent with the three fundamental criteria stated in &sect;&sect;905.1004/906.4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The Department intends to develop additional handbook materials to provide appropriate guidance and administrative
instructions for HAs, residents, and HUD Field Offices concerning the development, processing and implementation
of Section 5(h) homeownership plans.

In paragraph (a) of &sect;&sect;905.1002/906.2 (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Applicability
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the final rule adds clarifying language to explain that, except where otherwise indicated by the context, the term
``resident'' includes Turnkey III homebuyers (and, in the IHA version, Mutual Help homebuyers as well), along with
rental tenants of public or Indian housing and Section 8 residents. As suggested by one commenter, language has been
added to make it clear that, unless otherwise indicated, references to sale, purchase, conveyance and ownership
include the types of transactions and interests that are incident to cooperative ownership, such as cooperative
shares, membership, and occupancy agreements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 As another point of clarification, paragraph (b) of this section adds an express declaration of nonretroactivity.
This responds to one commenter's question about whether a Section 5(h) homeownership plan approved under the statutory
authority, prior to publication of the interim rule, would have to be modified to conform to the requirements of the
interim rule. Neither the interim nor final rule imposes any additional requirements for homeownership plans approved
before the respective effective dates of each rule.

With regard to &sect;&sect;905.1003/906.3 (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General authority for sale
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), one commenter observed that HUD Field Offices need instructions on how to release the declaration of trust upon
sale of housing units under a HUD-approved Section 5(h) homeownership plan. The Department agrees that such instructions
are needed, and intends to provide them in the forthcoming processing handbook. In the IHA version of this section,
the language of the interim rule concerning housing developments that are subject to project debt under the ACC has
been deleted, because, as a result of loan forgiveness legislation, there are now no Indian housing developments
which are subject to such indebtedness.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter urged that resident consultation be added to &sect;&sect;905.1004/906.4 (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fundamental criteria for HUD approval
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) as a fourth criterion. The final rule does not adopt this recommendation. The three fundamental criteria that are
established by this section merit special emphasis at the outset, because they go to the plan as a whole, serving as
touchstones for weighing and linking the discrete requirements of all subsequent sections, including the specific
requirements for resident consultation under &sect;&sect;905.1005/906.5.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Resident consultation and involvement
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) have been revised to clarify the requirements for resident input at the initial planning stage, in connection with
the HA's development of its proposed homeownership plan for submission to HUD. This language responds to the observations
of several commenters who aptly pointed out that the interim rule failed to indicate who must be consulted when the
development is vacant. The final rule addresses this question by specifying that, where the plan involves an entirely
vacant development, the HA must consult with the HA-wide resident organization, if any.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter argued that no resident consultation at all should be required for newly-developed vacant units, but
the Department sees no justification for exempting such units from the requirement that pertains to vacant units
in general. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a further provision in the direction of more local flexibility, the final rule deletes the interim rule's requirement
for a public hearing, leaving it to the HA and the residents to work out methods of consultation that they find most appropriate
and productive. While a public hearing may be advisable for larger undertakings, relatively informal consultation
may be more appropriate in other situations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter mistakenly asserted that ``there is no mention of resident involvement prior to implementation''.
On the contrary, the interim rule strongly emphasized the requirement for resident input during the planning stage,
and that requirement remains unchanged in the final rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In paragraph (a) of &sect;&sect;905.1006/906.6 (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Property that may be sold
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the final rule corrects the interim rule's unintended indication that only conventional rental units would be
eligible for sale under the Section 5(h) Program. The final rule notes that a homeownership plan may provide for converting
Turnkey III homes (and, in the case of an IHA, Mutual Help homes as well) to Section 5(h) homeownership, subject to the
contractual rights of existing Turnkey III or Mutual Help homebuyers, and an appropriate ACC amendment. An HA might
thus afford existing Turnkey III or Mutual Help homebuyers the option to terminate their Turnkey III or Mutual Help
homebuyer agreements in favor of Section 5(h) purchase of their present homes, or might make vacant Turnkey III or
Mutual Help units available for purchase under the terms of a Section 5(h) plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the public comments asked whether the regulation applies to newly-constructed housing. The answer is yes,
as expressly stated in the interim rule and restated in the final rule at paragraph (a) of &sect;&sect;905.1006/906.6.
As a clarification, however, the final rule adds a cautionary note regarding a question that may arise in rare situations
where the HA wants to consider Section 5(h) sale of units developed as replacement housing for public or Indian housing
demolished or disposed of under the regulations implementing section 18 of the Act (for IHAs, subpart M of 24 CFR part
905; for PHAs, 24 CFR part 970). This calls attention to the fact that the demolition-disposition regulations require
selection of the initial occupants of such replacement units solely on the basis of the requirements governing rental
occupancy (or, in the case of replacement of Indian housing with new Mutual Help units, the homebuyer occupancy requirements
of the Mutual Help Program).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) of these sections amplifies the provisions concerning the physical condition of the property, adding
the Section 8 housing quality standards as an alternative measure for cases where no local code exists, along with
a cross-reference to the regulatory requirements for accessibility by purchasers with disabilities. One commenter
objected to the option for post-conveyance repair. The Department believes that this option should be retained,
subject to the kind of protections for the homebuyer that are stipulated, including the final rule's addition of a
maximum period of two years for completion of the work needed to satisfy the regulatory standard. As a further clarification,
the option for a sound sweat equity arrangement has been added as another example of permissible means for making post-sale
improvements.

), language has been inserted in subparagraph (b)(2)(ii) to make it clear that, in the context of sale of a multifamily
building or a group of single-family dwellings via a resident-controlled entity, the prohibition against encumbrances
applies only to encumbrances by the resident entity, prior to conveyance of individual units to residents. Thus,
it would not be necessary to obtain additional HA consent for mortgages or other encumbrances that are incident to
the purchase and financing of individual units, pursuant to the provisions of the homeownership plan and the agreement
between the HA and the resident-controlled entity.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several changes have been made in &sect;&sect;905.1008/906.8 (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Purchaser eligibility and selection
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). In response to comments, the final rule allows HAs more flexibility concerning how they may wish to formulate the
particulars of the eligibility and preference provisions of their homeownership plans. It also incorporates a number
of clarifications and editorial revisions, including reordering the paragraphs in a more logical sequence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In paragraph (b) of these sections, language has been inserted to make it clear that Turnkey III homebuyers (and, in
the case of IHAs, Mutual Help homebuyers as well) are within the overall class of public or Indian housing residents
who are eligible to purchase under the Section 5(h) Homeownership Program, should they elect to terminate their existing
homebuyer agreements in favor of purchase under a Section 5(h) plan. A homeownership plan might thus allow Turnkey
III or Mutual Help homebuyers the individual option to switch over to Section 5(h) purchase of their present homes.
As another possibility, a plan might allow such a homebuyer to vacate the present Turnkey III or Mutual Help unit and
purchase a vacant unit that is offered for sale under the Section 5(h) plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment objected to the option to include Section 8 residents. The Department believes that the statute was intended
to allow that option, at HA discretion, subject to the minimum residency requirement and the requirements for admission
to public or Indian housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter objected to the 30-day minimum residency requirement, while another suggested that a minimum one-year
period be prescribed. Because Section 5(h) of the Act authorizes an HA to sell to ``its tenants'', some initial period
of public or Indian housing or Section 8 residency is a statutory precondition for purchaser eligibility, and the
Department believes that 30 days is the shortest period that satisfies the statute. Each HA is, however, free to include
in its homeownership plan a longer minimum period for such tenure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One objection was expressed about the further option (as now reflected in paragraph (c) of these sections) for the
HA to extend eligibility to applicants who are not public or Indian housing or Section 8 residents at the time of application,
subject to the preference for existing public and Indian housing residents and the requirement for a minimum period
of public or Indian housing residency prior to conveyance. The Department believes that the HA should have this option
to extend eligibility to families on its waiting lists, or to other low-income families who may wish to apply, or to
both of those categories, if the HA considers that they are needed to make up a sufficient pool of eligible applicants
for purchase of the vacant units that will be offered for sale. Such nonresident applicants would also be subject to
the requirements for admission to public or Indian housing, including the income limits and Federal preferences
for admission, as prescribed by applicable regulations. (Those admission requirements do not, however, apply to
applicants who are already residents of public or Indian housing.)

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The first sentence of &sect;&sect;905.1008(d)/906.8(d) modifies the interim rule's provision restricting eligibility
to applicants who have been current in their lease obligations for a period of at least six months. If a family has been
in residence for less than six months, the homeownership plan may now allow eligibility on the basis of lease compliance
for that lesser period. The final rule also adds language that is appropriate in this context to existing Turnkey III
or Mutual Help homebuyers who may elect to terminate their present Turnkey III or Mutual Help homebuyer agreements
in favor of purchase under a Section 5(h) homeownership plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to several comments, the affordability standard of &sect;&sect;905.1008(e)/906.8(e) has been modified.
In the interim rule, the cost-to-income ratio_based on mortgage principal and interest, plus insurance and real
estate taxes (PITI)_was 30 percent, but a percentage figure of 35 percent was allowed with special justification.
As aptly pointed out by some commenters, the interim rule did not say what was required to justify the 35 percent exception
ratio or how maintenance, utilities and (if applicable) common ownership fees were to be taken into account. The final
rule's revised formula now states that the average monthly estimate for the total amount of all of the stated types
of homeownership costs_including maintenance and utilities and (if applicable) cooperative, condominium or homeownership
association fees, as well as PITI_may not exceed 35 percent of the applicant's adjusted income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter urged that separate affordability standards be adopted for single-family and multifamily properties,
with the latter to take into account cooperative or condominium carrying charges, as well as debt service payments
on individual mortgages or share loans. For single-family houses, this commenter recommended that a PITI cost-to-income
ratio of more than 35 percent be authorized, citing the fact that, in the general housing market, the current ratio
among first-time homebuyers tends to be higher. For multifamily properties, a two-part affordability standard
was recommended: (1) the ability of homebuyers to meet their financial obligations on an individual family basis;
and (2) the ability of the homebuyers involved to meet their financial obligations on an aggregated basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the prospective purchasers under the Section 5(h) Program are low-income families, the Department believes
that it would be imprudent to allow a cost-income ratio of more than 35 percent for either single-family or multifamily
housing. The final rule requires that, if applicable, cooperative, condominium or other homeownership association
fees must be taken into account. This is sufficient to address the financial viability of multifamily properties
on both an individual and aggregated basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (g) of these sections simplifies the requirements concerning preference among the various residency-based
categories of potentially eligible applicants. This affords each HA broad discretion in defining, on the basis of
present residency status, which categories of residents are eligible to apply under the particular homeownership
plan, and in establishing preferences among those categories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For occupied units, the rule continues to require a preference for the existing occupants. If such occupants cannot
meet the other eligibility requirements, or do not desire to purchase their units, a further provision of the rule
(&sect;&sect;905.1010/906.10) prohibits their involuntary displacement to make the units available for sale
to other families. Consequently, the question of other residency-based eligibility and preference categories
is pertinent only if the homeownership plan contemplates sale of vacant units, or if an existing occupant voluntarily
agrees to vacate and relocate, pursuant to &sect;&sect;905.1010/906.10. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For vacant units, the only residency-based preference category that is mandated by the final rule consists of residents
of the HA's other public or Indian housing units. The HA may limit eligibility to applicants in that category only,
in which case the question of further residency-based eligibility or preference categories will not arise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternatively, subject to the preference for families who are already residents of public or Indian housing, the
homeownership plan may, at the option of an HA, also allow application for purchase of vacant units by families in either
or both of the other residency-based categories permitted under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section: (1) Section
8 residents, and (2) other low-income families who are neither public or Indian housing nor Section 8 residents at
time of application or selection, subject to their completion of the prescribed minimum period of public or Indian
housing or Section 8 residence prior to conveyance. For example, families in the second category_families who are
not presently public or Indian housing or Section 8 residents_would have to take occupancy of the Section 5(h) unit
under a lease-purchase agreement, providing for completion of an initial period of public or Indian housing tenancy
(30 days or more, as prescribed by the homeownership plan) prior to conveyance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted in &sect;&sect;905.1008(h)/906.8(i), the rule does not preclude any other types of eligibility and preference
factors that the HA may wish to establish in its homeownership plan, if consistent with statutory and regulatory requirements.
For example, in a situation where vacant units comprising only a portion of an otherwise occupied development are
to be offered for sale, the homeownership plan could limit eligibility to the other residents of the same development,
or give them preference over the residents of other HA developments. As another example, with reference to families
that are not already public or Indian housing or Section 8 residents, the HA would have the option to restrict eligibility
to families who are already on the HA's waiting lists for other programs, or to give such waiting list families a preference
over other nonresident applicants.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One question was raised about &sect;906.8(h) of the PHA rule, which mandates a preference for residents who have completed
self-sufficiency and job training programs. (There is no parallel provision in the IHA rule). The commenter asked
whether a resident who completes such a program in one PHA may qualify for the preference under another PHA's Section
5(h) homeownership plan. That is a matter for local determination. In general, a plan should allow for recognition
of sound self-sufficiency and job training programs, regardless of where completed, but the regulation leaves each
HA discretion to define the standards for acceptability.

One commenter recommended that HUD set minimum standards for counseling, in connection with the requirements of

Counseling, training, and technical assistance
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Detailed regulatory requirements on this subject would be inappropriate for the wide variety of local situations
that may be presented by particular Section 5(h) homeownership plans. While the rule establishes basic standards,
it is intended to allow due flexibility for HAs to design the kinds of counseling, training and technical assistance
activities that are necessary and appropriate for each local situation.

Two commenters recommended that &sect;&sect;905.1010/906.10 (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Nonpurchasing residents
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) be changed to delete the prohibition against involuntary displacement of nonpurchasing residents. The final rule
retains that prohibition. Another commenter urged that assistance under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and
Real Property Acquisition Act of 1970 (URA) be extended to residents who relocate voluntarily. The final rule does
not adopt that recommendation. The rule mandates that nonpurchasing residents be provided the opportunity to relocate
to another suitable and affordable unit, with counseling and advisory services, along with payment of moving expenses.
However, it is noted that the rule also provides that a violation of the prohibition against involuntary displacement
may trigger a requirement that the HA provide URA relocation assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some changes have nevertheless been made in this section, largely editorial revisions to clarify the requirements
that were reflected in the interim rule. In paragraph (b) of the PHA version only, familial status has been added to
the list of nondiscrimination factors. (The IHA version covers nondiscrimination by cross-reference to &sect;905.115.)
In both the IHA and PHA versions, a new paragraph (c) has been added to clarify requirements for temporary relocation
of nonpurchasing residents in connection with repair or rehabilitation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This prohibition applies only against displacement for the specific purpose of making the unit available for Section
5(h) sale to another family. It is not intended to prohibit a permanent move for any other reason required or authorized
by the existing occupant's lease (or homebuyer agreement), consistent with applicable statutes and HUD occupancy
regulations. For example, where the size of the unit in relation to family size results in overhousing or underhousing,
a family may be required to move to another unit of suitable size, pursuant to the HA's assignment policy.

In &sect;&sect;905.1011/906.11 (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Nonroutine maintenance reserve
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the interim rule's references to ``maintenance reserve'' have been changed to ``nonroutine maintenance''. This
clarifying change was prompted by the suggestion of one commenter that the term ``capital improvement and replacement
reserve'' be used. Two other commenters objected to this section entirely as an undue restriction on local discretion.
The Department believes that, considering the flexibility allowed, this reserve requirement is justified by the
financial viability test that is implicit in Section 5(h) of the Act, and expressly stated in Sec. 6(c)(4)(D) of the
Act.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter pointed out that the last sentence of paragraph (a) of &sect;&sect;905.1014/906.14 (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Limitation on resale profit
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) seemed to contradict the authorization for limited equity or shared equity arrangements. In the final rule, this
sentence has been revised to make it clear that, under a limited or shared equity arrangement, the resale provisions
may limit the seller to a portion of the resale profit attributable to appreciation in value. Language to similar effect
has also been inserted in the limited equity option under paragraph (c) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter urged that the regulation be modified to require or strongly encourage restriction of resale to
low-income families only. The final rule does not adopt this recommendation. Although the regulation allows HA discretion
to design limited equity arrangements with such resale restrictions, the statute does not authorize the Department
to mandate that for all cases.

With regard to &sect;&sect;905.1016/906.16 (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Replacement housing
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), one commenter objected to the inclusion of replacement options other than development of additional public or
Indian housing units. As an alternative to such a narrow restriction, the commenter suggested that the options included
in the interim rule be given priority in the order listed. Other commenters objected to the options for rehabilitation
of vacant public or Indian housing units and for use of Section 8 certificates and vouchers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule makes no change in the replacement options stated in the interim rule. Those options are statutory,
and the Department has no authority to change them by regulation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters addressed the question of funding for replacement housing. One recommended that such funding be built
into the Section 5(h) Program itself, while another suggested a priority for Major Rehabilitation of Obsolete Projects
(MROP) funding. The Department has not adopted those recommendations. Although special funding priorities for
replacement housing in connection with Section 5(h) homeownership plans may be established in the contexts of the
other HUD programs from which the funding becomes available, no provision for such funding is incorporated in the
Section 5(h) Homeownership Program itself.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter recommended that the regulation set a time limit on the actual provision of replacement housing. In
recognition of the different factual situations that may affect the time required to have replacement units ready
for occupancy, the Department believes that it would be unwise to set a rigid time limitation by regulation. However,
reasonable time frames for this and all other major steps must be established in the timetable to be included in the
homeownership plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The same commenter argued against the flexibility afforded by the interim rule for the HA to address the community's
current priority housing needs, urging that the regulation impose a rigid requirement to replace with units of the
same sizes as those sold, regardless of current needs. The Department believes that such rigidity would risk absurd
results, in those local situations where identical replacement would be at odds with intelligent prioritization
by the HA of the community's current housing needs. One commenter urged that the replacement housing requirements
be applied retroactively to plans approved or pending before publication of the interim rule. That point is addressed
in paragraph (d) of this section, which, as in the interim rule, reflects the legislative mandate in Section 5(h) of
the Act that the replacement housing provisions shall not apply to ``applications'' (proposed homeownership plans)
that were submitted to HUD prior to October 1, 1990_the effective date of the legislation that added the replacement
requirement to Section 5(h).

only if the plan allows purchase of vacant units by families who are not public housing residents or already on the PHA's
waiting lists for those programs) has been added to paragraph &sect;906.20(c). (There is no affirmative marketing

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the final rule explains that the purpose of the property value estimate is merely to assist HUD in determining whether
the plan adequately addresses the risks of fraud and abuse and the potential for windfall profit. For this item of supporting
documentation, a rough estimate is sufficient, backed by information to support its reasonableness. Submission
of a formal appraisal is not required at this point, because the Department does not believe that such an expense is
justified for the purpose of HUD review of the proposed homeownership plan. (Note, however, that this is a matter involving
only the initial process of preparation and review of the HA's proposal. It is not intended to contradict the rule's
separate requirement, in &sect;&sect;905.1014(e)/906.14(e), for the appraisal of individual dwelling units
at the point of sale, made with the distinct purpose of calculating the amount of resale profit that would be payable
to the PHA by the individual purchaser.)

Comments on Other Issues
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter observed that the interim rule contained no explicit mention as to whether the Section 5(h) authority
can be used in conjunction with other public housing homeownership programs, such as HOPE. Such questions will be
addressed in the context of the other programs involved, on a case-by-case basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It was also observed that the interim rule contained no explicit mention of whether Section 5(h) can be used in conjunction
with the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC). The Department believes that this is not an appropriate matter for
rulemaking at this time. The Department has not received any Section 5(h) proposals involving LIHTCs, and no determination
has been made as to whether it would be possible to design a feasible proposal of that nature. If warranted by future
experience, the Department will consider this question for further rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter recommended that the rule incorporate a specific list of all statutes and regulations that must be complied
with. A list of all of the multitude of Federal statutes and regulations that might possibly be applicable to all of
the variety of possible features of all of the many possible types of homeownership plans would be excessively lengthy
for inclusion in a regulation. While cross-references are cited for some especially important Federal requirements_notably,
as to fair housing and nondiscrimination_the possible variations among local homeownership plans make it impossible
to present a standard matrix of applicable legal requirements. As emphasized in the requirement for the HA to include
in its supporting documentation a legal opinion from its own counsel (&sect;&sect;905.1021(g)/906.21(g)), it
is the responsibility of the HA to ascertain for itself just what requirements of Federal, State, Tribal and local
law are pertinent to the facts of each particular homeownership plan. Compliance with State, Tribal and local laws
and regulations on real estate transactions is one of the critical points that must be carefully reviewed by the HA's
counsel.

This subpart applies to low-income housing owned by Indian Housing Authorities (IHAs), subject to Annual Contributions
Contracts (ACCs) under the Act. The terms ``housing'' or ``low-income housing'', as used in this subpart, refer to
the types of properties described in the preceding sentence, except as indicated by the particular context. In reference
to housing properties, ``development'' means the same as ``project'' (as defined in the Act). Except where otherwise
indicated by the context, ``resident'' means the same as ``tenant'', as the latter term is used in the Act, including
Mutual Help and Turnkey III homebuyers, as well as rental tenants of low-income housing and Section 8 residents, and
references to sale, purchase, conveyance and ownership include the types of interests and transactions that are
incident to cooperative ownership.

In the case of a Section 5(h) homeownership plan that was approved by HUD before the effective date of the interim rule
under this subpart (October 21, 1991) no modifications or additional requirements will be imposed under the provisions
of the interim or final rule, except for reasonable administrative procedures prescribed by HUD. Similarly, in the
case of a plan that was approved under the interim rule, but before the effective date of the final rule (December 12,
1994), no modifications or additional requirements will be imposed under the provisions of the final rule, except
for such reasonable administrative procedures.

An IHA may sell all or a portion of a development to eligible residents, as defined under &sect;905.1008, for purposes
of homeownership, according to a homeownership plan approved by HUD under this subpart. Upon sale in accordance with
the HUD-approved homeownership plan, HUD will execute a release of the title restrictions prescribed by the ACC.
Because the property will no longer be subject to the ACC after sale, it will cease to be eligible for further HUD funding
for operating subsidies or modernization under the Act upon conveyance of title by the IHA. (That does not preclude
any other types of post-sale subsidies that may be available, under other Federal, Tribal, State, or local programs,
such as the possibility of available assistance under Section 8 of the Act, in connection with a plan for cooperative
homeownership, if authorized by the Section 8 regulations.)

In developing a proposed homeownership plan, and in carrying out the plan after HUD approval, the IHA shall consult
with residents of the development involved, and with any resident organization that represents them, as necessary
and appropriate to provide them with information and a reasonable opportunity to make their views and recommendations
known to the IHA. If the plan contemplates sale of units in an entirely vacant development, the IHA shall consult with
the IHA-wide resident organization, if any. While the Act gives the IHA sole legal authority for final decisions,
as to whether or not to submit a proposed homeownership plan and the content of such a proposal, the IHA shall give residents
and their resident organizations full opportunity for input in the homeownership planning process, and full consideration
of their concerns and opinions.

addition, participation of an RMC or other resident organization in the implementation of the plan is encouraged.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subject to the workability criterion of &sect;905.1004(a) (including, for example, consideration of common elements
and other characteristics of the property), a homeownership plan may provide for sale of one or more dwellings, along
with interests in any common elements, comprising all or a portion of one or more housing developments. A plan may provide
for conversion of existing housing to homeownership or for homeownership sale of newly-developed housing. (However,
for low-income housing units developed as replacement housing for units demolished or disposed of pursuant to subpart
M of this part, that subpart requires that the initial occupants be selected solely on the basis of the requirements
governing rental occupancy (or Mutual Help occupancy, if applicable), without reference to any additional homeownership
eligibility or selection requirements under this subpart.) Mutual Help or Turnkey III homeownership units may be
converted to Section 5(h) homeownership, upon voluntary termination by any existing Mutual Help or Turnkey III homebuyers
of their contractual rights and amendment of the ACC, in a form prescribed by HUD.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Physical condition of property. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The property must meet local code requirements (or, if no local code exists, the housing quality standards established
by HUD for the Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments Program for Existing Housing, under 24 CFR part 882) and the requirements
for elimination of lead-based paint hazards in HUD-associated housing, under subpart C of 24 CFR part 35. When a prospective
purchaser with disabilities requests accessible features, the features must be added in accordance with 24 CFR parts
8 and 9. Further, the property must be in good repair, with the major components having a remaining useful life that
is sufficient to justify a reasonable expectation that homeownership will be affordable by the purchasers. This
standard must be met as a condition for conveyance of a dwelling to an individual purchaser, unless the terms of sale
include measures to assure that the work will be completed within a reasonable time after conveyance, not to exceed
two years (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

housing, provided that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(1) The other entity has the necessary legal capacity and practical capability to carry out its responsibilities
under the plan.

(i) Assurances that the other entity will comply with all provisions of the HUD-approved homeownership plan; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Assurances that the IHA's conveyance of the property to the other entity will be subject to a title restriction
providing that the property may be resold or otherwise transferred only by conveyance of individual dwellings to
eligible residents, in accordance with the HUD-approved homeownership plan, or by reconveyance to the IHA, and that
the property will not be encumbered by the other entity without the written consent of the IHA; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Protection against fraud or misuse of funds or other property on the part of the other entity, its employees and
agents;

(iv) Assurances that the resale proceeds will be used only for the purposes specified by the HUD-approved homeownership
plan;

Standards and procedures for eligibility and selection of the initial purchasers of individual dwellings shall
be consistent with the following provisions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Applications. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Persons who are interested in purchase must submit applications for that specific purpose, and those applications
shall be handled separately from applications for other IHA programs. For vacant units, applications shall be dated
as received by the IHA and, subject to eligibility and preference factors, selection shall be made in the order of receipt.
Application for homeownership shall not affect an applicant's place on any other IHA waiting list.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Eligibility threshold. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subject to any additional eligibility and preference standards that are required or permitted under this section,
a homeownership plan may provide for the eligibility of residents of low-income housing owned or leased by the seller
IHA (including Mutual Help and Turnkey III homebuyers, who may elect to terminate their existing homebuyer agreements
in favor of purchase under the Section 5(h) homeownership plan) and residents of other housing who are receiving housing
assistance under Section 8 of the Act, under an ACC administered by the seller IHA; provided that the resident has been
in lawful occupancy for a minimum period specified in the plan (not less than 30 days prior to conveyance of title to
the dwelling to be purchased). For residents of other housing who are receiving housing assistance under Section
8, the minimum occupancy requirement may be satisfied in the unit for which the family is receiving Section 8 assistance
or the Indian housing unit. If the family is to meet part or all of the minimum occupancy requirement in the Indian housing
unit, the Section 8 assistance must be terminated before the family moves into the Indian housing unit. Indian housing
units are ineligible for Section 8 certificate and voucher assistance as long as they remain under the ACC as Indian
housing.

(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Applicants who do not meet minimum residency requirement for eligibility. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) A homeownership plan, at IHA discretion, may also permit eligibility for applicants who do not meet the minimum
residency requirement of paragraph (b) of this section (30 days or more, as prescribed by the homeownership plan)
at the time of application, provided that their selection is conditioned upon completion of the minimum residency
requirement prior to conveyance of title. A plan may thus allow satisfaction of the threshold requirements for eligibility
by: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Existing low-income housing or Section 8 residents with less than the minimum period of residency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Families who are already on the IHA's waiting lists; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Other low-income families who are neither low-income housing nor Section 8 residents at the time of application
or selection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Applicants who are not already low-income housing residents, however, must also satisfy the requirements for
admission to such housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Compliance with lease obligations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Eligibility shall be limited, however, to residents who have been current in all of their lease obligations (in the
case of Mutual Help or Turnkey III homebuyers, obligations under their homebuyer agreements) over a period of not
less than six months prior to conveyance of title (or, if so provided by the homeownership plan, such lesser period
as has elapsed since the beginning of low-income housing or Section 8 tenure), including, but not limited to, payment
of rents (or homebuyer's monthly payments) and other charges and reporting of all income that is pertinent to determination
of rents (or homebuyer's monthly payments). At the IHA's discretion, the homeownership plan may allow a resident
to remedy under-reporting of income, provided that proper reporting of income would not have resulted in ineligibility
for admission to low-income housing or for Section 8 assistance, by payment of the resulting underpayment for rent
(or homebuyer's monthly payments) prior to conveyance of title to the homeownership dwelling, either in a lump sum
or in installments over a reasonable period. Alternatively, the plan may permit payment within a reasonable period
after conveyance of title, under an agreement secured by a mortgage on the property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Affordability standard. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Eligibility shall be further limited to residents who are capable of assuming the financial obligations of homeownership,
under minimum income standards for affordability, taking into account the unavailability of operating subsidies
and modernization funds after conveyance of the property by the IHA. A homeownership plan may, however, take account
of any available subsidy from other sources (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, in connection with a plan for cooperative ownership, assistance under Section 8 of the Act, if available and authorized
by the Section 8 regulations). Under this affordability standard, an applicant must meet the following requirements:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) On an average monthly estimate, the amount of the applicant's payments for mortgage principal and interest, plus
insurance, real estate taxes, utilities, maintenance, and other regularly-recurring homeownership costs (such
as condominium, cooperative, or other homeownership association fees) will not exceed the sum of 35 percent of the
applicant's adjusted income, as defined in this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The applicant can pay any amounts required for closing, such as a downpayment (if any) and closing costs chargeable
to the purchaser, in accordance with the homeownership plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Option to restrict eligibility. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A homeownership plan may, at the IHA's discretion, restrict eligibility to one or more residency-based categories
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, for occupied units, eligibility may be restricted to the existing residents of the units to be sold; for vacant units,
eligibility may be restricted to low-income housing residents only, or to low-income housing residents plus any
one or more of the other residency-based categories that may be established under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section),
as may be reasonable in view of the number of units to be offered for sale and the estimated number of eligible applicants
in various categories provided that the residency-based preferences mandated by paragraph (g) of this section are
observed.

 If an existing resident of a dwelling authorized for sale under a homeownership plan is ineligible for purchase, or
declines to purchase, the resident shall be given the choice of either relocation to other suitable and affordable
housing or continued occupancy of the present dwelling on a rental basis, at a rent no higher than that permitted by
the Act. Displacement (permanent, involuntary move), in order to make a dwelling available for sale, is prohibited.
In addition to applicable program sanctions, a violation of the displacement prohibition may trigger a requirement
to provide relocation assistance in accordance with the Uniform Relocation and Real Property Acquisition Act of
1970 and implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24. Where continued rental occupancy by a nonpurchasing resident
is contemplated after conveyance of the property, the homeownership plan must include provision for any rental subsidy
required (

the two. Discounted purchase prices may be determined on a unit-by-unit basis, based on the particular purchaser's
ability to pay, or may be determined by any other fair and reasonable method (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

General. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a dwelling is sold to the initial purchaser for less than fair market value, the homeownership plan shall provide
for appropriate measures to preclude realization by the initial purchaser of windfall profit on resale. ``Windfall
profit'' means all or a portion of the resale proceeds attributable to the purchase price discount (the fair market
value at date of purchase from the IHA less the below-market purchase price), as determined by one of the methods described
in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section. Subject to that requirement, however, purchasers should be permitted
to retain any resale profit attributable to appreciation in value after purchase (or a portion of such profit under
a limited or shared equity arrangement), along with any portion of the resale profit that is fairly attributable to
improvements made by them after purchase.

Promissory note method.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Where there is potential for a windfall profit because the dwelling unit is sold to the initial purchaser for less than
fair market value, without a commensurate limited or shared equity restriction, the initial purchaser shall execute
a promissory note, payable to the IHA, along with a mortgage securing the obligation of the note, on the following terms
and conditions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The principal amount of indebtedness shall be the lesser of: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The purchase price discount, as determined by the definition in paragraph (a) of this section and stated in the
note as a dollar amount; or

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(ii) The net resale profit, in an amount to be determined upon resale by a formula stated in the note. That formula shall
define net resale profit as the amount by which the gross resale price exceeds the sum of: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The discounted purchase price; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Reasonable sale costs charged to the initial purchaser upon resale; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Any increase in the value of the property that is attributable to improvements paid for or performed by the initial
purchaser during tenure as a homeowner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) At the option of the IHA, the note may provide for automatic reduction of the principal amount over a specified period
of ownership while the property is used as the purchaser's family residence, resulting in total forgiveness of the
indebtedness over a period of not less than five years from the date of conveyance, in annual increments of not more
than 20 percent. This does not require an IHA's plan to provide for any such reduction at all, or preclude it from specifying
terms that are less generous to the purchaser than those stated in the foregoing sentence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) To preclude collusive resale that would circumvent the intent of this section, the IHA shall (by an appropriate
form of title restriction) condition the initial purchaser's right to resell upon approval by the IHA, to be based
solely on the IHA's determination that the resale price represents fair market value or a lesser amount that will result
in payment to the IHA, under the note, of the full amount of the purchase price discount (subject to any accrued reduction,
if provided for by the homeownership plan pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section). If so determined, the IHA
shall be obligated to approve the resale. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The IHA may, in its sole discretion, agree to subordination of the mortgage that secures the promissory note, in
favor of an additional lien granted by the purchaser as security for a loan for home improvements or other purposes
approved by the IHA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Limited equity method.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As a second option, the requirement of this section may be satisfied by an appropriate form of limited equity arrangement,
restricting the amount of net resale profit that may be realized by the seller (the initial purchaser and successive
purchasers over a period prescribed by the homeownership plan) to the sum of: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The seller's paid-in equity; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The portion of the resale proceeds attributable to any improvements paid for or performed by the seller during
homeownership tenure; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) An allowance for a portion of the property's appreciation in value during homeownership tenure, calculated by
a fair and reasonable method specified in the homeownership plan (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, according to a price index factor or other measure). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Third option.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The requirements of this section may be satisfied by any other fair and reasonable arrangement that will accomplish
the essential purposes stated in paragraph (a) of this section.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sale proceeds may, after provision for sale and administrative costs that are necessary and reasonable for carrying
out the homeownership plan, be retained by the IHA and used for housing assistance to low-income families (as such
families are defined under the Act). The term ``sale proceeds'' includes all payments made by purchasers for credit
to the purchase price (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 earnest money, downpayments, payments out of the proceeds of mortgage loans, and principal and interest payments
under purchase-money mortgages), along with any amounts payable upon resale under &sect;905.1014, and interest
earned on all such receipts. (Residual receipts, as defined in the ACC, shall not be treated as sale proceeds.)

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Permissible uses. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sale proceeds may be used for any one or more of the following forms of housing assistance for low-income families,
at the discretion of the IHA and as stated in the HUD-approved homeownership plan: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) In connection with the homeownership plan from which the funds are derived, for purposes that are justified to
ensure the success of the plan and to protect the interests of the homeowners, the IHA and any other entity with responsibility
for carrying out the plan. Nonexclusive examples include nonroutine maintenance reserves under Sec. 905.1011,
a reserve for loans to homeowners to prevent or cure default or for other emergency housing needs; a reserve for any
contingent liabilities of the IHA under the homeownership plan (such as IHA guaranty of mortgage loans); and a reserve
for IHA repurchase, repair and resale of homes in the event of defaults. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In connection with another HUD-approved homeownership plan under this part, for assistance to purchasers and
for reasonable planning and implementation costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In connection with a Tribal, State or local homeownership program for low-income families, as described in the
homeownership plan, for assistance to purchasers and for reasonable planning and implementation costs. Under such
programs, sales proceeds may be used to construct or acquire additional dwellings for sale to low-income families,
or to assist such families in purchasing other dwellings from public or private owners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) In connection with the IHA's other low-income housing that remains under ACC, for any purposes authorized for
the use of operating funds under the ACC and applicable provisions of the Act and Federal regulations, as included
in the HUD-approved operating budgets. Examples include maintenance and modernization, augmentation of operating
reserves, protective services, and resident services. Such use shall not result in the reduction of the operating
subsidy otherwise payable to the IHA for its other low-income housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) In connection with any other type of Federal, Tribal, State, or local housing program for low-income families,
as described in the homeownership plan.

 Replacement requirement
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. As a condition for transfer of ownership under a HUD-approved homeownership plan, the IHA must obtain a funding commitment,
from HUD or another source, for the replacement of each of the dwellings to be sold under the plan. Replacement housing
may be provided by one or any combination of the following methods: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Development by the IHA of additional low-income housing under this part (by new construction or acquisition).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Rehabilitation of vacant low-income housing owned by the IHA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Use of five-year, tenant-based certificate or voucher assistance under Section 8 of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If the homeownership plan is submitted by the IHA for sale to residents through an RMC, resident organization or
cooperative association which is otherwise eligible to participate under this subpart, acquisition of nonpublicly-owned
housing units, which the RMC, resident organization or cooperative association will operate as rental housing,
comparable to IHA-owned low-income housing as to term of assistance, housing standards, eligibility, and contribution
to rent.

Although a HUD funding commitment is required if the replacement housing requirement is to be satisfied through any
of the HUD programs listed in paragraph (a) of this section, HUD's approval of a Section 5(h) homeownership plan on
the expectation that such a funding commitment will be forthcoming shall not constitute a binding obligation to make
such a commitment. Where the requirement is to be satisfied under a Tribal, State or local program, or a Federal program
not administered by HUD, a funding commitment shall be required from the proper authority.

e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, rehabilitation of vacant public housing units, or an eligible local program). Where a homeownership plan provides
for sale proceeds to be used for replacement housing, HUD approval of the plan and execution of the IHA&hyph;HUD implementing
agreement shall satisfy the funding commitment requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, with regard to the amount
of replacement housing to be funded out of sale proceeds.

expenditure of the sale proceeds shall be covered in the regular independent audits of the IHA's housing operations,
and any supplementary audits that HUD may find necessary for monitoring. Where another entity is responsible for
sale of individual units, pursuant to &sect;905.1007(b), the IHA must ensure that the entity's responsibilities
include proper recordkeeping and accountability to the IHA, sufficient to enable the IHA to monitor compliance with
the approved homeownership plan, to prepare its reports to HUD, and to meet its audit responsibilities. All books

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Submission to HUD. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The IHA shall submit the proposed plan, together with supporting documentation, in a format prescribed by HUD, to
the appropriate HUD Field Office. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Conditional approval. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Conditional approval may be given, at HUD discretion, where HUD determines that to be justified. For example, conditional
HUD approval might be a necessary precondition for the IHA to obtain the funding commitments required to satisfy the
requirements for final HUD approval of a complete homeownership plan. Where conditional approval is granted, HUD
will specify the conditions in writing.

documents), if their essential terms and conditions are described in the plan. Consequently, those documents need
not be submitted as part of the plan or the supporting documentation.

Purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This part codifies the provisions of the Section 5(h) Homeownership Program for public housing, as authorized by
sections 5(h) and 6(c)(4)(D) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (Act) and administered by the Department of Housing
and Urban Development (HUD).

(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General applicability. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This part applies to public housing owned by public housing agencies (PHAs) (excluding Indian Housing Authorities
(IHAs)) subject to Annual Contributions Contracts (ACCs) under the Act. In reference to housing properties, ``development''
means the same as ``project'' (as defined in the Act). Except where otherwise indicated by the context, ``resident''
means the same as ``tenant'', as the latter term is used in the Act, including Turnkey III homebuyers, if applicable,
as well as rental tenants of public housing and Section 8 residents, and references to sale, purchase, conveyance
and ownership include the types of interests and transactions that are incident to cooperative ownership. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Nonretroactivity. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the case of a Section 5(h) homeownership plan that was approved by HUD prior to the effective date of the interim rule
under this part (October 21, 1991), no modifications or additional requirements will be imposed under the provisions
of the interim or final rule, except for reasonable administrative procedures prescribed by HUD. Similarly, in the
case of a plan that was approved under the interim rule, before the effective date of the final rule (December 12, 1994),
no modifications or additional requirements will be imposed under the provisions of the final rule, except for such
reasonable administrative procedures.

General authority for sale. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A PHA may sell all or a portion of a public housing development to eligible residents, as defined under &sect;906.8,
for purposes of homeownership, according to a homeownership plan approved by HUD under this part. If the development
is subject to indebtedness under the ACC, HUD will continue to make any debt service contributions for which it is obligated
under the ACC, and the property sold will not be subject to the encumbrance of that indebtedness. (In the case of a development
with financing restrictions (such as a bond-financed development), however, sale is subject to the terms and conditions
of the applicable restrictions.) Upon sale in accordance with the HUD-approved homeownership plan, HUD will execute
a release of the title restrictions prescribed by the ACC. Because the property will no longer be subject to the ACC
after sale, it will cease to be eligible for further HUD funding for public housing operating subsidies or modernization
under the Act upon conveyance of title by the PHA. (That does not preclude any other types of post-sale subsidies that
may be available, under other Federal, State, or local programs, such as the possibility of available assistance
under Section 8 of the Act, in connection with a plan for cooperative homeownership, if authorized by the Section 8
regulations.)

Fundamental criteria for HUD approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD will approve a PHA's homeownership plan if it meets all three of the following criteria: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Workability. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The plan must be practically workable, with sound potential for long-term success. Financial viability, including
the capability of purchasers to meet the financial obligations of homeownership, is a critical requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Legality. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The plan must be consistent with law, including the requirements of this part and any other applicable Federal, State,
and local statutes and regulations, and existing contracts. Subject to the other two criteria stated in this section,
any provision that is not contrary to those legal requirements may be included in the plan, at the discretion of the
PHA, whether or not expressly authorized in this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Documentation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The plan must be clear and complete enough to serve as a working document for implementation, as well as a basis for HUD
review.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Resident input. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In developing a proposed homeownership plan, and in carrying out the plan after HUD approval, the PHA shall consult
with residents of the development involved, and with any resident organization that represents them, as necessary
and appropriate to provide them with information and a reasonable opportunity to make their views and recommendations
known to the PHA. If the plan contemplates sale of units in an entirely vacant development, the PHA shall consult with
the PHA-wide resident organization, if any. While the Act gives the PHA sole legal authority for final decisions,
as to whether or not to submit a proposed homeownership plan and the content of such a proposal, the PHA shall give residents
and their resident organizations full opportunity for input in the homeownership planning process, and full consideration
of their concerns and opinions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Where individual residents, a Resident Management Corporation (RMC), or another form of resident organization
may wish to initiate discussion of a possible homeownership plan, the PHA shall negotiate with them in good faith.
Joint development and submission of the plan by the PHA and RMC, or other resident organization, is encouraged. In
addition, participation of an RMC or other resident organization in the implementation of the plan is encouraged.

Types of property.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Subject to the workability criterion of &sect;906.4(a) (including, for example, consideration of common elements
and other characteristics of the property), a homeownership plan may provide for sale of one or more dwellings, along
with interests in any common elements, comprising all or a portion of one or more public housing developments. A plan
may provide for conversion of existing public housing to homeownership or for homeownership sale of newly-developed
public housing. (However, for public housing units developed as replacement housing for units demolished or disposed
of pursuant to 24 CFR part 970, that part requires that the initial occupants be selected solely on the basis of the requirements
governing rental occupancy, without reference to any additional homeownership eligibility or selection requirements
under this part.) Turnkey III homeownership units may be converted to Section 5(h) homeownership, upon voluntary
termination by any existing Turnkey III homebuyers of their contractual rights and amendment of the ACC, in a form
prescribed by HUD.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Physical condition of property.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The property must meet local code requirements (or, if no local code exists, the housing quality standards established
by HUD for the Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments Program for Existing Housing, under 24 CFR part 882) and the requirements
for elimination of lead-based paint hazards in HUD-associated housing, under subpart C of 24 CFR part 35. When a prospective
purchaser with disabilities requests accessible features, the features must be added in accordance with 24 CFR parts
8 and 9. Further, the property must be in good repair, with the major components having a remaining useful life that
is sufficient to justify a reasonable expectation that homeownership will be affordable by the purchasers. These
standards must be met as a condition for conveyance of a dwelling to an individual purchaser, unless the terms of sale
include measures to assure that the work will be completed within a reasonable time after conveyance, not to exceed
two years (

 A PHA may sell dwellings to residents directly or (with respect to multifamily buildings or a group of single-family
dwellings) through another entity established and governed by, and solely composed of, residents of the PHA's public
housing, provided that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The respective rights and obligations of the PHA and the other entity will be specified by a written agreement that
includes: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Assurances that the other entity will comply with all provisions of the HUD-approved homeownership plan; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Assurances that the PHA's conveyance of the property to the other entity will be subject to a title restriction
providing that the property may be resold or otherwise transferred only by conveyance of individual dwellings to
eligible residents, in accordance with the HUD-approved homeownership plan, or by reconveyance to the PHA, and that
the property will not be encumbered by the other entity without the written consent of the PHA;

Purchaser eligibility and selection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Standards and procedures for eligibility and selection of the initial purchasers of individual dwellings shall
be consistent with the following provisions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Applications.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Persons who are interested in purchase must submit applications for that specific purpose, and those applications
shall be handled separately from applications for other PHA programs. For vacant units, applications shall be dated
as received by the PHA and, subject to eligibility and preference factors, selection shall be made in the order of receipt.
Application for homeownership shall not affect an applicant's place on any other PHA waiting list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Eligibility threshold.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Subject to any additional eligibility and preference standards that are required or permitted under this section,
a homeownership plan may provide for the eligibility of residents of public housing owned or leased by the seller PHA
(including Turnkey III homebuyers who may elect to terminate their existing Turnkey III homebuyer agreements in
favor of purchase under the Section 5(h) homeownership plan) and residents of other housing who are receiving housing
assistance under Section 8 of the Act, under an ACC administered by the seller PHA, provided that the resident has been
in lawful occupancy for a minimum period specified in the plan (not less than 30 days prior to conveyance of title to
the dwelling to be purchased). For residents of other housing who are receiving housing assistance under Section
8, the minimum occupancy requirement may be satisfied in the unit for which the family is receiving Section 8 assistance
or the public housing unit. If the family is to meet part or all of the minimum occupancy requirement in the public housing
unit, the Section 8 assistance must be terminated before the family moves into the public housing unit. Public housing
units are ineligible for Section 8 certificate and voucher assistance as long as they remain under ACC as public housing.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Applicants who do not meet minimum residency requirement for eligibility.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) A homeownership plan, at PHA discretion, may also permit eligibility for applicants who do not meet the minimum
residency requirement of paragraph (b) of this section (30 days or more, as prescribed by the homeownership plan)
at the time of application, provided that their selection is conditioned upon completion of the minimum residency
requirement prior to conveyance of title. (A plan may thus allow satisfaction of the threshold requirements for eligibility
by: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Existing public housing or Section 8 residents with less than the minimum period of residency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Compliance with lease obligations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Eligibility shall be limited to residents who have been current in all of their lease obligations (in the case of Turnkey
III homebuyers, obligations under their Turnkey III homebuyer agreements) over a period of not less than six months
prior to conveyance of title (or, if so provided by the homeownership plan, such lesser period as has elapsed since
the beginning of public housing or Section 8 tenure), including, but not limited to, payment of rents (or homebuyer's
monthly payments) and other charges, and reporting of all income that is pertinent to determination of rental charges
(or homebuyer's monthly payments). At the PHA's discretion, the homeownership plan may allow a resident to remedy
under-reporting of income, provided that proper reporting of income would not have resulted in ineligibility for
admission to public housing or for Section 8 assistance, by payment of the resulting underpayment for rent (or homebuyer's
monthly payments) prior to conveyance of title to the homeownership dwelling, either in a lump-sum or in installments
over a reasonable period. Alternatively, the plan may permit payment within a reasonable period after conveyance
of title, under an agreement secured by a mortgage on the property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Affordability standard.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Eligibility shall be limited to residents who are capable of assuming the financial obligations of homeownership,
under minimum income standards for affordability, taking into account the unavailability of public housing operating
subsidies and modernization funds after conveyance of the property by the PHA. A homeownership plan may, however,
take account of any available subsidy from other sources (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, in connection with a plan for cooperative ownership, assistance under Section 8 of the Act, if available and authorized
by the Section 8 regulations). Under this affordability standard, an applicant must meet the following requirements:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) On an average monthly estimate, the amount of the applicant's payments for mortgage principal and interest, plus
insurance, real estate taxes, utilities, maintenance and other regularly recurring homeownership costs (such
as condominium, cooperative, or other homeownership association fees) will not exceed the sum of: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 35 percent of the applicant's adjusted income as defined in 24 CFR Part 913; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Any subsidy that will be available for such payments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The applicant can pay any amounts required for closing, such as a downpayment (if any) and closing costs chargeable
to the purchaser, in accordance with the homeownership plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Option to restrict eligibility.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A homeownership plan may, at the PHA's discretion, restrict eligibility to one or more residency-based categories
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, for occupied units, eligibility may be restricted to the existing residents of the units to be sold; for vacant units,
eligibility may be restricted to public housing residents only, or to public housing residents plus any one or more
of the other residency-based categories that may be established under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section), as
may be reasonable in view of the number of units to be offered for sale and the estimated number of eligible applicants
in various categories, provided that the residency-based preference requirements mandated by paragraph (g) of
this section are observed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Residency-based preferences.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For occupied units, a preference shall be given to the existing residents of each of the dwellings to be sold. For vacant
units (including units which are voluntarily vacated), a preference shall be given to residents of other public housing
units owned or leased by the seller PHA (over any other residency-based categories that may be established by the homeownership
plan for Section 8 residents and any categories of nonresident applicants). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Self sufficiency preference.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For vacant units, a further preference shall be given to those applicants who have completed self-sufficiency and
job training programs, as identified in the homeownership plan, or who meet equivalent standards of economic self-sufficiency,
such as actual employment experience, as specified in the homeownership plan.

If an existing resident of a dwelling authorized for sale under a homeownership plan is ineligible for purchase, or

housing or continued occupancy of the present dwelling on a rental basis, at a rent no higher than that permitted by
the Act. Displacement (permanent, involuntary move) in order to make a dwelling available for sale, is prohibited.
In addition to applicable program sanctions, a violation of the displacement prohibition may trigger a requirement
to provide relocation assistance in accordance with the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition
Act of 1970 and implementing regulations at 49 CFR Part 24. Where continued rental occupancy by a nonpurchasing resident
is contemplated after conversion of the property to cooperative or condominium ownership, the homeownership plan
must include provision for any rental subsidy required (

A nonpurchasing resident who chooses to relocate pursuant to this section shall be offered the following relocation
assistance:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Advisory services to assure full choices and real opportunities to obtain relocation within a full range of neighborhoods
where suitable housing may be found, in and outside areas of minority concentration, including timely information,
counseling, explanation of the resident's rights under the Fair Housing Act, and referrals to suitable, safe, sanitary
and affordable housing (at a rent no higher than permitted by the Act), which is of the resident's choice, on a nondiscriminatory
basis, without regard to race, color, religion (creed), national origin, handicap, age, sex, or familial status,
in compliance with applicable Federal and State law. This requirement will be met if the resident is offered the opportunity
to relocate to other suitable housing under the Public Housing Program, any of the housing assistance programs under
Section 8 of the Act, or any other Federal, State or local program that is comparable, as to standards of housing quality,
admission and rent, to the programs under the Act, and provides a term of assistance of at least five years; and

If a dwelling is sold to the initial purchaser for less than fair market value, the homeownership plan shall provide
for appropriate measures to preclude realization by the initial purchaser of windfall profit on resale. ``Windfall
profit'' means all or a portion of the resale proceeds attributable to the purchase price discount (the fair market
value at date of purchase from the PHA less the below-market purchase price), as determined by one of the methods described
in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section. Subject to that requirement, however, purchasers should be permitted
to retain any resale profit attributable to appreciation in value after purchase (or a portion of such profit under
a limited or shared equity arrangement), along with any portion of the resale profit that is fairly attributable to
improvements made by them after purchase.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Where there is potential for a windfall profit because the dwelling unit is sold to the initial purchaser for less than
fair market value, without a commensurate limited or shared equity restriction, the initial purchaser shall execute
a promissory note, payable to the PHA, along with a mortgage securing the obligation of the note, on the following terms
and conditions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The principal amount of indebtedness shall be the lesser of:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The purchase price discount, as determined by the definition in paragraph (a) of this section and stated in the
note as a dollar amount; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The net resale profit, in an amount to be determined upon resale by a formula stated in the note. That formula shall
define net resale profit as the amount by which the gross resale price exceeds the sum of:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The discounted purchase price;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Reasonable sale costs charged to the initial purchaser upon resale; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Any increase in the value of the property that is attributable to improvements paid for or performed by the initial
purchaser during tenure as a homeowner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) At the option of the PHA, the note may provide for automatic reduction of the principal amount over a specified period
of ownership while the property is used as the purchaser's family residence, resulting in total forgiveness of the
indebtedness over a period of not less than five years from the date of conveyance, in annual increments of not more
than 20 percent. This does not require a PHA's plan to provide for any such reduction at all, or preclude it from specifying
terms that are less generous to the purchaser than those stated in the foregoing sentence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) To preclude collusive resale that would circumvent the intent of this section, the PHA shall (by an appropriate
form of title restriction) condition the initial purchaser's right to resell upon approval by the PHA, to be based
solely on the PHA's determination that the resale price represents fair market value or a lesser amount that will result
in payment to the PHA, under the note, of the full amount of the purchase price discount (subject to any accrued reduction,
if provided for by the homeownership plan pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section). If so determined, the PHA
shall be obligated to approve the resale.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The PHA may, in its sole discretion, agree to subordination of the mortgage that secures the promissory note, in
favor of an additional lien granted by the purchaser as security for a loan for home improvements or other purposes
approved by the PHA.

. Sale proceeds may, after provision for sale and administrative costs that are necessary and reasonable for carrying
out the homeownership plan, be retained by the PHA and used for housing assistance to low-income families (as such
families are defined under the Act). The term ``sale proceeds'' includes all payments made by purchasers for credit
to the purchase price (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, earnest money, downpayments, payments out of the proceeds of mortgage loans, and principal and interest payments
under purchase-money mortgages), along with any amounts payable upon resale under &sect;906.14, and interest earned

Sale proceeds may be used for any one or more of the following forms of housing assistance for low-income families,
at the discretion of the PHA and as stated in the HUD-approved homeownership plan: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) In connection with the homeownership plan from which the funds are derived, for purposes that are justified to
ensure the success of the plan and to protect the interests of the homeowners, the PHA and any other entity with responsibility
for carrying out the plan. Nonexclusive examples include nonroutine maintenance reserves under &sect;906.11;
a reserve for loans to homeowners to prevent or cure default or for other emergency housing needs; a reserve for any
contingent liabilities of the PHA under the homeownership plan (such as PHA guaranty of mortgage loans); and a reserve
for PHA repurchase, repair and resale of homes in the event of defaults. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In connection with another HUD-approved homeownership plan under this part, for assistance to purchasers and
for reasonable planning and implementation costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In connection with a State or local homeownership program for low-income families, as described in the homeownership
plan, for assistance to purchasers and for reasonable planning and implementation costs. Under such programs, sales
proceeds may be used to construct or acquire additional dwellings for sale to low-income families, or to assist such
families in purchasing other dwellings from public or private owners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) In connection with the PHA's other public housing that remains under ACC, for any purposes authorized for the use
of operating funds under the ACC and applicable provisions of the Act and Federal regulations, as included in the HUD-approved
operating budgets. Examples include maintenance and modernization, augmentation of operating reserves, protective
services, and resident services. Such use shall not result in the reduction of the operating subsidy otherwise payable
to the PHA under 24 CFR part 990. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) In connection with any other type of Federal, State, or local housing program for low-income families, as described
in the homeownership plan.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Replacement requirement
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. As a condition for transfer of ownership under a HUD-approved homeownership plan, the PHA must obtain a funding commitment,
from HUD or another source, for the replacement of each of the dwellings to be sold under the plan. Replacement housing
may be provided by one or any combination of the following methods: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Development by the PHA of additional public housing under 24 CFR part 941 (by new construction or acquisition).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Rehabilitation of vacant public housing owned by the PHA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Use of five-year, tenant-based certificate or voucher assistance under Section 8 of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If the homeownership plan is submitted by the PHA for sale to residents through an RMC, resident organization or
cooperative association which is otherwise eligible to participate under this part, acquisition of nonpublicly-owned
housing units, which the RMC, resident organization or cooperative association will operate as rental housing,
comparable to public housing as to term of assistance, housing standards, eligibility, and contribution to rent.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Any other Federal, State, or local housing program that is comparable, as to housing standards, eligibility and
contribution to rent, to the programs referred to in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section, and provides
a term of assistance of not less than five years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Funding commitments. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although a HUD funding commitment is required if the replacement housing requirement is to be satisfied through any
of the HUD programs listed in paragraph (a) of this section, HUD's approval of a Section 5(h) homeownership plan on
the expectation that such a funding commitment will be forthcoming shall not constitute a binding obligation to make
such a commitment. Where the requirement is to be satisfied under a State or local program, or a Federal program not
administered by HUD, a funding commitment shall be required from the proper authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Use of sale proceeds to fund replacement housing. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sale proceeds that are generated under the homeownership plan may be used under some of the replacement housing options
under paragraph (a) of this section (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., rehabilitation of vacant public housing units, or an eligible local program). Where a homeownership plan provides
for sale proceeds to be used for replacement housing, HUD approval of the plan and execution of the PHA&hyph;HUD implementing
agreement shall satisfy the funding commitment requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, with regard to the amount
of replacement housing to be funded out of sale proceeds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Consistency with current housing needs. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Replacement housing may differ from the dwellings sold under the homeownership plan, as to unit sizes or family or
elderly occupancy, if the PHA determines that such change is consistent with current local housing needs for low-income
families. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Inapplicability to prior plans. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

The PHA shall be responsible for the maintenance of records (including sale and financial records, which must include
information on the racial and ethnic characteristics of the purchasers) for all activities incident to implementation
of the HUD-approved homeownership plan. Until all planned sales of individual dwellings have been completed, the
PHA shall submit to HUD annual sales reports, in a form prescribed by HUD. The receipt, retention, and expenditure
of the sale proceeds shall be covered in the regular independent audits of the PHA's public housing operations, and
any supplementary audits that HUD may find necessary for monitoring. Where another entity is responsible for sale
of individual units, pursuant to &sect;906.7(b), the PHA must ensure that the entity's responsibilities include
proper recordkeeping and accountability to the PHA, sufficient to enable the PHA to monitor compliance with the approved
homeownership plan, to prepare its reports to HUD, and to meet its audit responsibilities. All books and records shall
be subject to inspection and audit by HUD and the General Accounting Office (GAO).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Whether to develop and submit a proposed homeownership plan is a matter within the discretion of each PHA. A PHA may
initiate a proposal at any time, according to the following procedures: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Preliminary consultation with HUD staff
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Before submission of a proposed plan, the PHA shall consult informally with the appropriate HUD Field Office to assess
feasibility and the particulars to be addressed by the plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Submission to HUD. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PHA shall submit the proposed plan, together with supporting documentation, in a format prescribed by HUD, to
the appropriate HUD Field Office. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Conditional approval. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Conditional approval may be given, at HUD discretion, where HUD determines that to be justified. For example, conditional
HUD approval might be a necessary precondition for the PHA to obtain the funding commitments required to satisfy the
requirements for final HUD approval of a complete homeownership plan. Where conditional approval is granted, HUD
will specify the conditions in writing.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Upon HUD notification to the PHA that the homeownership plan is approvable (in final form that satisfies all applicable
requirements of this part), the PHA and HUD will execute a written implementing agreement, in a form prescribed by
HUD, to evidence HUD approval and authorization for implementation. The plan itself, as approved by HUD, shall be
incorporated in the implementing agreement. Any of the items of supporting documentation may also be incorporated,
if agreeable to the PHA and HUD. The PHA shall be obligated to carry out the approved homeownership plan and other provisions
of the implementing agreement without modification, except with written approval by HUD.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The standards and procedures to be used for homeownership applications and the eligibility and selection of purchasers,
consistent with the requirements of &sect;906.8. If the homeownership plan allows application for purchase of vacant
units by families who are not presently public housing or Section 8 residents and not already on the PHA's waiting lists
for those programs, the plan must include an affirmative fair housing marketing strategy for such families, including
specific steps to inform them of their eligibility to apply, and to solicit applications from those in the housing
market who are least likely to apply for the program without special outreach.

Other information.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any other information that may reasonably be required for HUD review of the plan. Except for the PHA-HUD implementing
agreement under &sect;906.19, HUD approval is not required for documents to be prepared and used by the PHA in implementing
the plan (such as contracts, applications, deeds, mortgages, promissory notes, and cooperative or condominium
documents), if their essential terms and conditions are described in the plan. Consequently, those documents need
not be submitted as part of the plan or the supporting documentation.
