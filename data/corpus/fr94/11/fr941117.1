<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This notice revises an earlier proposed airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Teledyne Continental Motors
(TCM) (formerly Bendix) S&hyph;20, S&hyph;1200, D&hyph;2000, and D&hyph;3000 series magnetos equipped with impulse
couplings, that would have superseded an AD that currently requires inspections for wear, and replacement, if necessary,
of the impulse coupling assemblies. The proposed rule would have retained the repetitive inspections for wear required
by the current AD, but would have also required replacement, if necessary, of riveted impulse coupling assemblies
with newly designed, improved, snap ring impulse coupling assemblies. In addition, the proposed AD would have required
marking the magneto data plate to indicate installation of a snap ring impulse coupling assembly. Installation of
snap ring impulse coupling assemblies would have constituted terminating action to the inspection requirements
of the AD. That proposal was prompted by availability of an improved design for the impulse coupling assembly. This
action revises the proposed rule by retaining the 500 hour repetitive inspections for wear required by the current
AD but makes them effective for the snap ring couplings as well. The actions specified by this proposed AD are intended
to prevent magneto failure and subsequent engine failure.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 4, 1983, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued airworthiness directive (AD) 78&hyph;09&hyph;07
R3, Amendment 39&hyph;4538 (48 FR 1482, January 13, 1983), to require inspections for wear, and replacement, if necessary,
of the impulse coupling assemblies on certain Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM) (formerly Bendix) S&hyph;20, S&hyph;1200,
D&hyph;2000, and D&hyph;3000 series magnetos equipped with impulse couplings. That action was prompted by reports
of numerous magneto failures. That condition, if not corrected, could result 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in magneto failure and subsequent engine failure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations was published as a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM)
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on September 21, 1993 (58 FR 48987). That NPRM would have retained the repetitive inspections for wear required by
the current AD, but would have also required replacement, if necessary, of the riveted impulse coupling assembly
with newly designed, improved, snap ring impulse coupling assemblies. In addition, the proposed AD would have required
marking the magneto data plate to indicate installation of a snap ring impulse coupling assembly. Installation of
snap ring impulse coupling assemblies would have constituted terminating action to the inspection requirements
of this AD. That NPRM was prompted by the manufacturer redesigning the impulse coupling assembly to include snap ring
fastening technology which strengthens the cam axle and reduces wear. The snap ring impulse coupling assembly was
believed not to have the failure mode of the previous design. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the issuance of that NPRM, the FAA has received reports of snap ring impulse coupling assemblies being worn beyond
limits. This supplemental proposed AD would therefore retain the 500 hour repetitive inspections for wear required
by the current AD, but would require these inspections for magnetos equipped with snap ring impulse coupling assemblies
as well. Since this change expands the scope of the originally proposed rule, the FAA has determined that it is necessary
to reopen the comment period to provide additional opportunity for public comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of TCM Mandatory Service Bulletin (MSB) No. MSB645, dated
April 4, 1994, that describes procedures for inspection of the impulse coupling assemblies for wear; and TCM SB No.
639, dated March 1993, that clarifies procedures for installation of impulse coupling assemblies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 130,000 magnetos would be affected by this proposed AD, that the required inspection would
take 1 work hour, plus 1 work hour to change the impulse coupling, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour.
The average utilization of the fleet of these airplanes is estimated to be evenly divided between commercial/commuter
service and private owners. The commercial/commuter service population is estimated to operate 500 hours time in
service (TIS) per year; therefore the cost to perform the inspections required by the proposed AD would be approximately
$3,575,000 per year. The FAA estimates that private owners operate their aircraft between 50 and 100 hours TIS per
year; therefore it will take approximately 5 to 10 years to reach 500 hours time in service. The estimated cost for these
owners would also be $3,575,000 spread over a time period of 5 to 10 years or 715,000 per year for 5 years or $357,500 for
10 years. The cost to replace the impulse coupling assembly is $125 per magneto plus one work hour at $55 per work hour
for a total of $180 per magneto. While all the riveted impulse coupling assemblies will eventually have to be replaced,
it is not possible to estimate the cost per year. The total cost for replacement for U.S. operators would be $23,400,000.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

 The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has received reports of some confusion as to what is meant by S&hyph;20,
S&hyph;1200, D&hyph;2000, and D&hyph;3000 series magnetos as referenced in TCM Mandatory Service Bulletin (MSB)
No. MSB645, dated April 4, 1994, and this airworthiness directive (AD). A typical example is S6RN&hyph;25, where
the S designates single type ignition unit (a D designates a dual ignition unit), the 6 designates the number of cylinders,
the R designates right hand rotation, the N is the manufacturer designation (this did not change when TCM purchased
the Bendix magneto product line), and the number after the dash indicates the series (a&hyph;25 is a S&hyph;20 series
magneto while a&hyph;3200 is a D&hyph;3000 series magneto, etc.).

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This Notice proposes allocations for 50 megahertz of spectrum that is being transferred from Federal Government
use to private sector use. This action is necessary to comply with provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1993 (Reconciliation Act) that require the Commission to allocate, and propose regulations to assign, this
spectrum within 18 months of adoption of the Reconciliation Act. Our goal in this proceeding is to ensure that spectrum
reallocated for private sector is put to its highest and most valued use and that the greatest benefit to the public
is attained.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The purpose of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
NPRM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is to propose allocations for 50 megahertz of spectrum that is being transferred from Federal Government to private
sector use as required by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993,
Pub. L. No. 103&hyph;66, Title VI, Section 6001(a)(3), 107 Stat. 312 (approved August 10, 1993) (Reconciliation
Act).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. In compliance with the provision of the Reconciliation Act, the Department of Commerce released a report on February
10, 1994, which made a preliminary identification of 200 megahertz of spectrum for reallocation from Federal Government
to private sector use, including 50 megahertz at 2390&hyph;2400 MHz, 2402&hyph;2417 MHz, and 4660&hyph;4685 MHz
identified for immediate availability. The Reconciliation Act requires that, by February 10, 1995, the Commission
allocate, and propose regulations to assign, the 50 megahertz of spectrum that is immediately available. On May 4,
1994 we released a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice of Inquiry,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 59 FR 25589 (5/17/94), in this proceeding to seek information on potential uses for the spectrum that is immediately
available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The instant 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
NPRM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 proposes that all 50 megahertz of immediately available spectrum be allocated generally for Fixed and Mobile services.
Such a broad and general allocation will allow for flexible use of the spectrum and should ensure that the spectrum
is put to its best and most valued use. We also believe that most of the services that will be provided in this spectrum
will likely meet the statutory criteria for auction and therefore propose that licenses for this spectrum be made
available through competitive bidding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. We wish to create a competitive market structure that will provide incentives to develop and introduce innovative
service features and technologies. Comments are requested on a licensing structure that will achieve such a result,
including channel block size and geographic licensing areas. We also propose that technical flexibility in the provision
of services be permitted and request comment on specific technical requirements necessary to maximize flexibility
while ensuring against interference.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. As an alternative to allocating this spectrum generally for Fixed and Mobile service, we request comment on the
possible allocation of these bands for specific communications services. A number of suggestions were put forth
by various commenters responding to the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice of Inquiry
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in this proceeding. These include an aeronautical audio/visual service to provide real time information and entertainment
aboard aircraft, wireless local loop service, broadcast auxiliary services to support advanced television, low-power
communications, either on a licensed or unlicensed basis, and continued use of some of this spectrum by the amateur
community.

Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reason for Action:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The changes to Part 2 of the Commission's Rules proposed herein are for use of the spectrum that is being reallocated
from Federal Government to non-Government use. This reallocation of spectrum is required by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Objectives:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission seeks to allocate the spectrum for services that present the greatest potential to provide benefit
to the public by providing for the introduction of new services and the enhancement of existing services. These new
and enhanced services will create new jobs, foster economic growth, and improve access to communications by industry
and the American public.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Legal Basis:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The legal basis for these rule changes is found in Sections 4(i), 303(g), 303(r), and 332(a) of the Communications
Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;154(i), 303(g), 303(r), and 332(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance Requirements:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 No reporting, recordkeeping, or other compliance requirements are proposed in this item.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Federal Rules Which Overlap, Duplicate or Conflict With These Rules:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 None.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Description, Potential Impact, and Number of Small Entities Involved:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Many small entities could be positively affected by this proposal because the allocations proposed will foster new
technologies, resulting in new jobs, economic growth, and improved access to communications by industry, including
small entities. The number of small entities that will be affected is unknown.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Any Significant Alternatives Minimizing the Impact on Small Entities Consistent with the Stated Objectives:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This Notice of Proposed Rule Making solicits comments on a variety of alternatives. Additionally, all significant
alternatives presented in response to the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice of Inquiry
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in this proceeding have been addressed in this Notice of Proposed Rule Making.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Paperwork Reduction:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposal has been analyzed with respect to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 and found to contain no new or modified
form, information collection and/or recordkeeping, disclosure or record retention requirements and will not increase
the burden hours imposed on the public.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule would amend our regulations to establish psychiatric residential treatment facilities as a new
category of Medicaid facility, and establish standards that these facilities would have to meet; and specify that
psychiatric units of general hospitals may be used for acute psychiatric care for individuals under age 21. It also
would improve the regulatory implementation of the statutory requirements for State development of a comprehensive
mental health program and coordination of various State authorities concerned with provision of mental health and
related services. In addition, this proposed rule would ensure that representatives from agencies providing services
to an individual develop and manage a coordinated plan of care whenever feasible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule would implement section 4755(a) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (Public Law 101&hyph;508).

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Medicaid is the Federally assisted State program authorized under title XIX of the Social Security Act (the Act) to
provide funding for medical care provided to certain needy aged, blind and disabled persons, families with dependent
children, and low-income pregnant women and children. Each State determines the scope of its program, within limitations
and guidelines established by the law and the implementing regulations at 42 CFR chapter IV, subchapter C. Each State
submits a State plan that, when approved by HCFA, provides the basis for granting Federal funds to cover part of the
expenditures incurred by the State for medical assistance and the administration of the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1902(a) of the Act specifies the eligibility requirements that individuals must meet in order to receive
Medicaid. Other sections of the Act describe the eligibility groups in detail and specify limitations on what may
be paid for as ``medical assistance.''

II. Statutory and Regulatory History_Inpatient Psychiatric Hospital Services Benefit for Individuals Under Age
21 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Social Security Amendments of 1972 (Public Law 92&hyph;603) amended the Medicaid statute to, among other things,
allow States the option of covering inpatient psychiatric hospital services for individuals under age 21. In this
preamble, we will refer to inpatient psychiatric hospital services for individuals under age 21 as the ``psychiatric
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
21 benefit.'' Originally the statute required that the psychiatric
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
21 benefit be provided by psychiatric hospitals that were accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of
Hospitals. This organization is now called the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations.
We will refer to this organization as the ``Joint Commission.''

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1976 the Social and Rehabilitation Service, one of the agencies that later merged to form HCFA, published final
regulations in the 45 CFR part 249 implementing the psychiatric
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
21 benefit. These regulations allowed the coverage of this benefit in psychiatric facilities that were accredited
by the Joint Commission. The term ``psychiatric facility'' was used rather than the statutory term ``psychiatric
hospital'' because the Joint Commission had modified its accrediting practices to encompass a broader range of settings
providing psychiatric services. Since the statute at that time required Joint Commission accreditation, HCFA desired
to keep its requirements consistent with Joint Commission practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1981 HCFA received comments from the Joint Commission expressing concern about HCFA's regulatory requirement
for Joint Commission accreditation. The Joint Commission indicated that this Federal requirement was in conflict
with Joint Commission policy that facilities should seek accreditation voluntarily. In response, HCFA noted that
the regulatory requirement for Joint Commission accreditation could not be removed because it was required by statute.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1984, the Congress amended section 1905(h) of the Act, removing the requirement for Joint Commission accreditation
and adding the requirement that providers of the psychiatric
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
21 benefit meet the definition of a ``psychiatric hospital'' under the Medicare program as specified in section 1861(f)
of the Act (section 2340 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (Public Law 98&hyph;369)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Despite this statutory change, based on our understanding of Congressional intent, we did not remove the requirement
for Joint Commission accreditation from HCFA regulations, which are in subpart D of 42 CFR part 441. Our reliance on
Joint Commission accreditation was the only basis for coverage of the psychiatric
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
21 benefit in psychiatric facilities other than psychiatric hospitals. Our decision to retain the regulatory requirement
for Joint Commission accreditation was based on the fact that, in enacting the 1984 amendment, the Congress gave no
indication that it intended to narrow the psychiatric
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
21 benefit or alter HCFA policy that had been in effect since 1976. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 5, 1990, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA '90), Public Law 101&hyph;508, was enacted.
Consistent with HCFA's interpretation reflected in 42 CFR 441 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., section 4755 of OBRA '90 amended section 1905(h) of the Act to specify that the psychiatric
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
21 benefit can be provided in psychiatric hospitals that meet the definition of that term in section 1861(f) of the
Act ``or in another inpatient setting that the Secretary has specified in regulations.'' This amendment, which was
effective as if it had been enacted earlier as part of the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984, affirmed and effectively ratified
preexisting HCFA policy as articulated in subpart D of 42 CFR part 441, which interpreted sections 1905(a)(16) and
1905(h) of the Act as not being limited solely to psychiatric hospital settings. OBRA '90, therefore, provides authority
for HCFA to specify inpatient settings in addition to the psychiatric hospital setting for the psychiatric
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 1905(a) of the Act, Medicaid payment is generally not available for any services provided to individuals
under age 65 who are patients in ``institutions for mental diseases'' (IMDs). This statutory preclusion of Medicaid
payment is commonly known as the ``IMD exclusion.'' The term ``IMD'', as defined in section 1905(i) of the Act, includes
hospitals, nursing facilities, or other institutions of more than 16 beds that are primarily engaged in providing
diagnosis, treatment, or care of persons with mental diseases, including medical attention, nursing care, and related
services.

L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
21 benefit must, however, be provided in all States to those individuals who are determined during the course of an
Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) screen to need this type of inpatient psychiatric
care. Under the EPSDT provisions at section 1905(r)(5) of the Act, as amended by section 6403 of the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1989, Public Law 101&hyph;239, States must provide any service listed in section 1905(a) of
the Act that is needed to correct or ameliorate defects and physical and mental conditions discovered by EPSDT screening
services, whether or not the service is covered under the State plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While some inpatient psychiatric services can be provided in the psychiatric units of general hospitals as ``inpatient
hospital services'' under section 1905(a)(1) of the Act, the services provided under the psychiatric
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
21 benefit, and which meet the regulatory requirements in subpart D of part 441, must also be available for children
and adolescents who are determined to need these services as a result of an EPSDT screen. Because of the section 1905(r)(5)
requirement, even States that do not elect to include the optional psychiatric
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
21 benefit in their State plans must be aware of its provisions so that inpatient psychiatric services can be provided
to EPSDT-eligible individuals who are determined to require them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under current law, Medicaid payment for psychiatric services can be available under a variety of services and settings
listed in section 1905(a) of the Act. Optional inpatient psychiatric services are available for individuals age
65 or over in IMDs which are inpatient hospitals or nursing facilities (section 1905(a)(14) of the Act). Payment is
available for medically necessary inpatient psychiatric services provided to Medicaid recipients of all ages in
general hospitals, since such hospitals are typically not IMDs. Outpatient psychiatric services can be covered
in the outpatient hospital setting or under the optional clinic or rehabilitative services benefits (see sections
1905(a)(2)(A), 1905(a)(9) and 1905(a)(13) of the Act). Finally, the physicians' service benefit under section
1905(a)(5)(A) of the Act can include psychiatrists' services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 1905(a) of the Act, Medicaid payment is available for case management services, as defined in section
1915(g)(2) of the Act, which can be used to coordinate needed mental health services. Case management services assist
individuals in gaining access to needed medical, social, educational, and other services. Moreover, under section
1915(g)(1), such case management services may be targeted to chronically mentally ill persons. Although coverage
of case management services is generally optional for States, the case management services under section 1905(a)(19)
must be provided under the EPSDT authority cited above if the need for these services is discovered during an EPSDT
screen (see section 1905 (r)(5)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4722 of OBRA '90 amended section 1905(a) of the Act to provide that no service shall be excluded from the definition
of ``medical assistance'' solely because it is provided as a treatment service for alcoholism or drug dependency.
(Under the International Classification of Diseases, which HCFA relies on for classification purposes, alcoholism
and chemical dependency are classified as mental disorders.) This provision does not override the IMD exclusion,
nor does it require a State to include chemical dependency treatment under any other optional benefit unless it chooses
to do so.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the Medicaid statute was enacted in 1965, it has required that all State agencies involved with mental health
care coordinate their activities. Specifically, section 1902(a)(20)(A) of the Act requires that the State Medicaid
agency, in a State offering the optional IMD benefit under section 1905(a)(14), have agreements or other arrangements
with other State authorities concerned with mental diseases. These include arrangements for joint planning and
development of alternate methods of care, and arrangements providing assurance of immediate readmittance to institutions,
where needed, for individuals under alternate plans of care. The IMD services authorized under section 1905(a)(14)
currently are provided by 45 States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1902(a)(20)(B) of the Act contains additional requirements regarding IMD benefits for individuals age
65 or older. Among other provisions, this section requires that the Medicaid State plan provide for an individual
plan for each patient who may be in need of institutional care to ensure that any ``institutional care provided to him
is in his best interests, including, to that end, assurances that there will be initial and periodic review of his medical
and other needs.'' In addition, the State plan must include assurances that each patient will be given appropriate
treatment within the institution, and that each patient will have a periodic assessment of the need for continued
treatment in the institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1902(a)(20)(C) of the Act further requires States that offer the IMD benefit to provide for development of
alternate plans of care, making maximum utilization of available resources, for recipients age 65 or older who would
otherwise need institutional care, including appropriate medical treatment and other aid or assistance. This section
also requires that States develop the methods of administration necessary to ensure that these responsibilities
of the State agency for these recipients are effectively carried out. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1902(a)(21) of the Act requires that these States show that they are making satisfactory progress toward
developing and implementing a comprehensive mental health program, including provision for utilization of community
mental health centers and other alternatives to care in public IMDs. (The State's comprehensive mental health services
plan, which a State has prepared in accordance with section 1912 of the Public Health Service Act, can serve as a basis
for this process). These statutory requirements were designed to ensure that the mental health services covered
by Medicaid are coordinated with all related services provided by other State authorities and that appropriate alternatives
to institutional care are available. These requirements are implemented in our regulations at 42 CFR 441.106, which
provides, among other things, that if a State plan includes services in public institutions for mental diseases,
the State must implement a comprehensive mental health program which covers all ages. In this way, we make clear that
a comprehensive program must include services for individuals under age 21 and over age 64 who are possible candidates
for Medicaid coverage of inpatient psychiatric care as well as services for individuals age 22 through 64 who do not
have a Medicaid benefit for inpatient psychiatric care.

IV. General Goal of Proposed Regulatory Revisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are preparing the proposed regulations under the authority provided by section 1905(h) of the Act, as amended by
section 4755 of OBRA '90, to specify alternative inpatient settings in which inpatient psychiatric services may
be covered for individuals under age 21. We also propose to update our rules for the psychiatric

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the process of developing these proposed regulations, we have consulted with several other Federal agencies,
including the Civilian Health and Medical Programs of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) and the National Institutes
of Mental Health (NIMH), a number of States, and with a wide array of private organizations concerned with the provision
of mental health services to children and adolescents. We propose to establish a policy which will improve coordination
of the psychiatric
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
21 benefit with other services generally being provided to mentally ill children and adolescents, such as educational
services, child welfare services, and juvenile justice services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amid widespread concern that the services provided for mentally ill children and adolescents and their families
are often overlapping, duplicative, and sometimes at cross-purposes because they have not been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coordinated with each other, many States have begun to coordinate the activities of the State and local authorities
involved with caring for mentally ill children and adolescents to ensure joint planning and joint provision of services.
In many cases these efforts have been based on the NIMH's Child and Adolescent Service System Program. In addition,
the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation has funded coordinated ``Mental Health Service Programs for Youth'' at 8 sites.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is especially critical that the possible need for inpatient services be considered in the context of all the services
involved in a child's or adolescent's care because an unnecessary admission can put the individual at risk of a lifetime
of public dependency. Inpatient admission also inevitably results in trauma and disruption of a child's normal support
systems. Intensive services are increasingly available in the community to help resolve crisis situations. When
inpatient admission is necessary, it is often needed because early intervention and treatment have been lacking.
For this reason, fewer admissions to mental health facilities may be required when a comprehensive care system has
been in place for a period of time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Coordinated programs are oriented toward the needs of children rather than being structured according to the requirements
of various funding sources, and they result in a wider array of available services. Coordinated programs can lower
overall costs because duplicative and unnecessary services can be eliminated, and optimal services can be made available.
If the array of services available is uncoordinated, the patient runs the risk of an unnecessary admission because
the alternative services that may have been more effective are not as readily available and the admission, therefore,
occurs by default. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many studies have indicated that the most important factors in maintaining the beneficial effects of mental health
treatment for children and adolescents are the availability and use of a wide range of post-treatment resources.
Such resources include appropriate educational and vocational services and supportive services for the family
members who will have ongoing responsibility for caring for the children. Many of these services are beyond the purview
of the Medicaid program, but they are, nonetheless, vital to the mental health of Medicaid recipients and have direct
bearing on future mental health service needs. These proposed regulations would support State coordination and
planning efforts in this area (&sect;441.106).

Psychiatric Treatment

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many professionals contend that psychiatric treatment should be available in a wide array of settings, including
office visits, clinic services, home-based treatment programs, day treatment programs, partial hospitalization
(day hospital), therapeutic foster care provided by trained ``parents,'' residential treatment facility services,
and acute psychiatric hospital care.

Mental health professionals generally agree that it is best for the individual for services to be provided in the least
restrictive setting possible. In addition, it is usually cost effective to do so. ``Least restrictive setting''
generally means that needed care should be provided on an outpatient basis in the community where the individual lives,
as opposed to in an inpatient setting. This principle has been codified in Part B of the Education of the Handicapped
Act, Public Law 94&hyph;142 (20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Medicaid program has frequently been criticized for favoring institutional care over community-based care
because the reimbursement rates are often viewed as being more adequate for inpatient care, and because eligibility
may be more readily available for institutionalized individuals. As a result, institutional care may have been provided
when it was not medically necessary, with possible detrimental effects on the patient, because alternative community
care was not available. Various studies have estimated that from 39 to 95 percent of the psychiatric inpatient care
provided is medically unnecessary. In fact, a wide array of outpatient mental health services can be funded under
Medicaid, but for a variety of reasons these options have not been fully utilized by many States and outpatient providers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In recent years, however, many States have become concerned about dramatic increases in Medicaid expenditures for
inpatient psychiatric care and have sought to assure that alternative care is available in the community. Many States
have moved to increase funding for community services and instituted effective screening procedures for inpatient
admissions. We are proposing revisions in &sect;441.152, concerning certification of the need for inpatient care,
that we believe will serve to support these efforts. These proposals are discussed in section V of this preamble.

Inpatient Settings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed in Section II Statutory and Regulatory History of this preamble, existing regulations allow the provision
of psychiatric inpatient care for individuals under age 21 in any psychiatric facility that is accredited by the Joint
Commission and meets the other requirements in subpart D of 42 CFR part 441. The Joint Commission accredits a wide variety
of health care organizations which may provide inpatient or outpatient services. Inpatient psychiatric services
are currently being provided for individuals under age 21 in psychiatric hospitals in all but 7 States. Psychiatric
hospitals must, under section 1905(h)(1)(A), meet the Medicare definition of ``psychiatric hospital'' contained
in section 1861(f) of the Act. The regulatory requirements relating to psychiatric hospitals are specified in &sect;482.60,
Special provisions applying to psychiatric hospitals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, 14 States provide inpatient psychiatric services for individuals under age 21 in psychiatric units
in general hospitals. Three States cover the psychiatric
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
21 benefit in nursing facilities, and 19 States cover this benefit in facilities called ``residential treatment
facilities.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although nursing facilities (NFs) are a recognized category of inpatient provider, we decided against designating
NFs as an alternative setting for the psychiatric
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
21 benefit because NFs are primarily designed to provide geriatric nursing care and would not generally be appropriate
for children and adolescents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In view of the fact that a number of States no longer use psychiatric hospitals to provide services to individuals under
age 21 and a significant number of States now provide this inpatient benefit in psychiatric units of general hospitals,
we propose to specify in the proposed regulations that States may use psychiatric units of general hospitals to provide
acute psychiatric inpatient care under the psychiatric

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We propose to revise existing regulations to establish a definition of the term ``psychiatric residential treatment
facility'' (PRTF) and conditions of participation for this type of facility. A PRTF is a community-based facility
that provides a less medically intensive program of treatment than a psychiatric hospital or a psychiatric unit of
a general hospital. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed PRTF standards are based on existing standards for these facilities developed by CHAMPUS, the Joint
Commission, and a number of States and other organizations. We have tried to structure the PRTF conditions of participation
to ensure practical outcome-oriented benefit to patients, rather than establishing ``paper'' compliance with
procedures and policies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also would revise &sect;441.152, which specifies the requirements for certification of the need for admission
to all psychiatric
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
21 providers. These provisions are discussed in detail in section V of this preamble. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any State that chooses to offer the psychiatric
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
21 benefit would be required, at a minimum, to provide acute psychiatric care in a psychiatric hospital or a psychiatric
unit of a general hospital. States would have the further option of also providing inpatient psychiatric services
in the freestanding PRTF setting. If a State does not choose to include PRTF services as part of the psychiatric
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
21 benefit, it would not be required to certify freestanding PRTFs if it determines that medically necessary residential
treatment services for EPSDT patients can be provided in a certified distinct part PRTF located in a general hospital
or psychiatric hospital setting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PRTFs would provide a type of care that is distinctly different from the care provided by acute care facilities and
therefore a PRTF that is affiliated with a participating psychiatric hospital or general hospital would need to obtain
separate PRTF certification in addition to its hospital certification. The setting(s) that a State chooses to use
for the psychiatric
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
21 benefit would be indicated in its State plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PRTFs would be certified in the same manner as other inpatient providers of Medicaid services. States may contract
for specialized personnel to perform surveys if they wish to. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently operating residential treatment facilities include a wide range of providers, from facilities that provide
care similar to that provided in psychiatric hospitals to facilities that are more similar to group homes. In addition,
many residential treatment facilities are part of multi-service mental health organizations which also provide
a range of outpatient services. A number of States have developed or are in the process of developing licensure requirements
for these facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Treatment in residential treatment facilities generally costs less per day than treatment in a psychiatric hospital,
but because the length of stay in residential facilities is generally longer, treatment in a residential facility
is not always less expensive for the total inpatient stay. Rates for residential treatment facility services now
range from approximately $140 to $420 per day, including professional fees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some States have developed managed care systems for mental health services and, in some cases, States have combined
Medicaid funding for these mental health benefits with funding for related services administered by other agencies
in the State. These arrangements tend to ensure that treatment programs are developed in response to the individual's
service needs rather than being structured according to the funding criteria of various programs; we support these
coordinated efforts. Under these programs, Medicaid is only billed for Medicaid covered services provided to Medicaid
eligible individuals.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the course of developing these proposed regulations, several parties suggested that intensive outpatient services
be included as a subcategory of services under the psychiatric
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
21 benefit in order to emphasize that outpatient services can often be substituted for inpatient care, with less traumatic
impact on the patient. Although we support the goal of substituting outpatient services for inpatient services whenever
possible, the statutory language of section 1905(h) of the Act authorizing this inpatient benefit does not provide
latitude for including outpatient services; this benefit must be provided in ``a psychiatric hospital *&blank;*&blank;*
or in another inpatient setting.'' We believe, however, that the system we have proposed for assessing the total needs
of each child or adolescent will support the goal of assuring that outpatient services are used whenever this is a feasible
alternative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It was also suggested that we consider allowing children and adolescents who do not require inpatient treatment of
their mental conditions to enter residential facilities if they require residential placement to remove them from
a problematic family setting. In this situation, it was suggested that Medicaid would fund the treatment services,
and payment for the cost of room and board would come from other sources. While we recognize that this type of arrangement
may be necessary in some circumstances, and we acknowledge that rehabilitative services can be provided in a wide
variety of settings, we note that care provided under such an arrangement would not be provided in the context of the
psychiatric
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
21 benefit, which is restricted by statute to individuals who require inpatient care for treatment of their mental
condition (section 1905(h)(1)(B)). Accordingly, we have not incorporated this suggestion into the proposed regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We would establish a new &sect;441.45, Mental health assessment and service plan, which implements section 1902(a)(26)
of the Act. This section requires individual plans of care for psychiatric inpatients and periodic medical review
in each psychiatric institution. The State would be required to ensure that a comprehensive assessment is made (&sect;441.45(a))
and that an individual comprehensive services plan (&sect;441.45(b)) is developed for each individual who has been
determined to be at risk of requiring inpatient mental health treatment. We propose to extend this requirement to
include not only eligible individuals currently receiving inpatient mental hospital services, but also certain
eligible individuals who the State reasonably believes may imminently need such services, because we believe that
such a requirement is a necessary safeguard to ensure proper utilization of inpatient services. We also believe that
such a requirement will help to ensure continuity of care and appropriate service utilization for patients who have
had intermittent inpatient mental hospital services. Furthermore, such a requirement is consistent with requirements
for comprehensive assessments of medical status and needs under the early and periodic screening, diagnosis and
treatment benefit available to individuals under the age of 21. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A State must consider at risk of requiring inpatient mental health services at least those eligible individuals who
are in the following categories: those who are applicants for inpatient mental health facilities, those determined
to need inpatient mental health services on an EPSDT screen or preadmission screening and annual resident review
(PASARR), and those discharged from an inpatient mental health facility, during the year following discharge. A
State may include other groups of eligible individuals who it believes are at risk of needing inpatient treatment
in the near future. For eligible individuals who have been identified based on an EPSDT screen or a PASARR, a State may
adopt as its assessment or comprehensive service plan the results of these other reviews if those reviews are sufficient
to meet the requirements specified in &sect;441.45.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comprehensive mental health planning for a child or adolescent would typically involve representatives from the
State mental health department, the child welfare authority, the educational/vocational services agency, the
public health department, and in some cases the alcohol/drug treatment agency, and/or the juvenile justice system.
The Medicaid agency would participate with these agencies in determining the proportionate share of funding responsibility
for the services needed under the plan. The child or adolescent and the parents or guardians would also be involved
in developing the services plan, and parents or guardians must also be involved in any treatment provided in order
to ensure maximum long term benefit from the treatment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We would revise &sect;441.106, Comprehensive mental health program, which implements the statutory requirement
for a comprehensive mental health program, to reflect the statutory provisions more explicitly. The revision of
this section, consistent with sections 1902 (a)(20) and (a)(21) of the Act, would require that each State's comprehensive
mental health program involve all agencies in the State that serve mentally ill individuals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid's statutory authority for requiring a comprehensive mental health program applies to all States offering
services for individuals age 65 and over in institutions for mental diseases (currently 46 States) and our regulations
at &sect;441.106 have long required that the comprehensive program cover all ages. Section 1912 of the Public Health
Service Act includes a similar mental health planning provision and we would specify that any program developed as
a result of that requirement would meet the Medicaid requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An annual progress report on the State's comprehensive mental health program is required under existing &sect;441.106(c).
We would move this requirement to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;441.106(b), and modify it to specify that a comprehensive mental health services plan developed under section
1912 of the Public Health Service Act would satisfy the Medicaid reporting requirement. If a separate report is prepared,
the interagency group involved in mental health planning would participate in the report preparation. The revision
would also specify that the report must be submitted to the HCFA Regional Administrator within 3 months after the end
of the fiscal year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;441.151, General requirements, a new paragraph (c) would be added to require that services provided to an
individual under the psychiatric
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
21 benefit must be compatible with the individual's comprehensive services plan developed as specified in &sect;441.45(b)
(discussed above). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also would delete the existing regulatory requirement for Joint Commission accreditation in &sect;441.151(b).
As discussed in section II of this preamble, this requirement was removed from the law in 1984 and the Joint Commission
has indicated that it does not wish to have its accreditation mandated in HCFA regulations since accreditation is
voluntary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We would require that psychiatric facilities meet either the psychiatric hospital requirements specified in existing
&sect;482.60 and proposed &sect;483.202, or operate as an inpatient psychiatric unit in a general hospital that
meets the requirements of existing subparts B and C of part 482 and proposed &sect;483.202, or meet the psychiatric
residential treatment facility conditions of participation that we are proposing in &sect;&sect;483.210 through
483.224 of the new subpart F of part 483. To summarize, all providers of the psychiatric
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
21 benefit would be required to meet the condition of participation in &sect;483.202 relating to active treatment
and the inpatient plan of treatment, in addition to meeting the other regulatory requirements applicable to the particular
setting.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to meeting the PRTF requirements specified in these proposed regulations, as determined by the survey
process, a State could also require Joint Commission accreditation or accreditation by any other accrediting organization
determined appropriate by the State if it wishes to. The regulations at 42 CFR 431.51(c)(2) allow States to establish
reasonable standards relating to qualifications of providers. We emphasize that accreditation by an organization
would not, however, be considered a substitute for meeting the regulatory requirements in the proposed new subpart
F of part 483. Reliance on varied and changing accreditation requirements in the past has led to widespread confusion
about the requirements providers must meet as Medicaid participants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We propose to modify the certification requirements in &sect;441.152, Certification of need for services, by adding
a requirement that the team or organization responsible for certifying the need for care must complete a comprehensive
assessment as specified in &sect;441.45(a) prior to determining whether inpatient care is necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, we would require that the certification include the documented clinical evidence that serves as the
basis for the certification. We wish to make it clear that certification of the need for inpatient care is not to be made
unless inpatient care is medically necessary for treatment of the child or adolescent, as required by the statute.
Section 1905(h)(1)(B) of the Act requires that ``physicians and other personnel qualified to make determinations
with respect to mental health conditions and the treatment thereof'' certify the need for care which they have determined
to be ``necessary on an inpatient basis and can reasonably be expected to improve the condition, by reason of which
such services are necessary, to the extent that eventually such inpatient services will no longer be necessary.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For this reason, we propose to delete the requirement in existing &sect;441.152(a)(1) that the certification include
a statement that the ambulatory care resources available in the community do not meet the treatment needs of the recipient.
This ``availability of ambulatory care'' requirement was designed to supplement the certification of the medical
necessity for inpatient care. However, we are concerned that this requirement may have been misinterpreted as forming
a basis for certifying that inpatient care was needed when, in fact, it was not clinically required. Inpatient care
may have been incorrectly certified to be necessary only because the community services that would have been sufficient
and preferable for that individual were not available in his or her community. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the above circumstances, the current reference to ambulatory services may have contributed to the inappropriately
high incidence of unnecessary inpatient care. HCFA believes that if the need for inpatient care is certified on the
basis that ambulatory care is unavailable, this action would undermine an important impetus to developing needed
community services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed certification statement would have to indicate which category of inpatient services are needed, i.e.,
acute psychiatric services or PRTF services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State Medicaid agency needs to ensure that the teams that develop the individual comprehensive services plans
and assess the need for inpatient care are prepared to confer informally on a timely basis so that decisions concerning
possible inpatient admissions can be made in times of crisis. Special procedures would be established for emergency
admissions under the psychiatric
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
21 benefit to psychiatric hospitals or inpatient units of general hospitals, as specified in &sect;441.152(c).
Continued coordination and case management are vital in assuring that needed educational/vocational services
are available in the community since these services are often critical in forestalling the need for repeated inpatient
mental health treatment.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a Medicaid eligible patient requires an emergency admission to a psychiatric hospital or psychiatric inpatient
unit of a general hospital, we would require that hospital staff assess the patient's condition and certify the need
for inpatient care and then initiate appropriate treatment as soon as possible following admission. If an individual
does not apply for Medicaid until after admission, the assessment and certification of the need for inpatient care
would be made by hospital or facility staff within 7 days following the application for Medicaid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The formal inpatient plan of treatment developed in accordance with proposed &sect;483.202(b) would have to be implemented
within 7 days following admission or application for Medicaid if the individual remains in the hospital that long.
The inpatient plan would need to be compatible with the individual's comprehensive services plan developed as specified
in &sect;441.45(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No emergency admissions would be allowed for psychiatric residential treatment facilities (PRTFs). PRTFs provide
less medically intensive and less extensive services than psychiatric hospitals or psychiatric units of general
hospitals and are not generally equipped or staffed to deal with acute situations; if an acute situation arises during
a PRTF stay, the patient would generally need to be transferred to an acute care facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We would revise &sect;441.153, Team certifying need for services, concerning the team that makes the certification
that inpatient care is necessary, by deleting the requirement that different types of teams make the certification
depending on when the individual becomes eligible for Medicaid. We instead propose that, whenever possible, the
certification would be made by a team composed of representatives of the agencies providing services to the individual
in order to ensure that these services are coordinated and that all possible alternatives to inpatient care are considered.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The stress placed on interdisciplinary planning in this regulation is based on the premise that inpatient psychiatric
services should be used only when medically necessary, and that those who are responsible for provision of all services
to mentally ill individuals will arrange services in the individual's best interest, and arrange for services in
the community whenever possible. When inpatient psychiatric care is provided, the stay should be as brief as possible,
and focused on improving the individual's condition as quickly as possible to the point that he or she can be maintained
with community-based services. Although it may be difficult to arrange for the necessary interagency coordination
in States that have not already developed a coordinated approach, it is counterproductive to provide services in
a fragmented manner that does not recognize the total service needs of the child or adolescent. Even when a State is
not able to utilize interagency teams for certification of the need for inpatient care upon the effective date of this
regulation, we expect that all States will move toward improving coordination of interrelated services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If inpatient psychiatric care is determined to be necessary, an interdisciplinary approach would also ensure that
all service providers are aware of the need to arrange for or to accommodate service delivery in the new setting. The
school system, for example, will need to arrange for or coordinate the provision of educational services in the inpatient
setting. We would not require that team members meet in person to discuss cases if they find it more convenient to communicate
via a teleconference or other means. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We would retain the regulatory requirement for physician participation in the certification process (&sect;441.153(c)(1)),
consistent with section 1905(h) of the Act, which requires that the team certifying the need for care include a physician.
The physician may be a representative of one of the service agencies.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The team members must generally be independent, i.e., they may not be employees of the inpatient facility being considered
for admission of the individual. If the inpatient facility is a public facility, an individual who is employed by the
governmental component responsible for administration of the inpatient facility would not be considered independent.
If inpatient care is required on an emergency basis, however, or the individual applied for Medicaid after admission,
certification may be made by employees of the inpatient facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In some States, it may not currently be feasible to use service agency representatives to form the review team. HCFA
plans to provide guidance on this issue in the State Medicaid Manual. In such circumstances, the State would need to
arrange for another type of review group. The State could establish its own review teams or contract with an independent
review organization to determine whether admissions are necessary. An organization's team would need to meet any
State registration requirements and would have to have physician participation in the determination of the necessity
of inpatient psychiatric services, as required by statute. These teams or organizations would also be required to
be aware of and consider the total service needs of each individual (&sect;441.153). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rules in &sect;&sect;441.154 and 441.155 concerning ``active treatment'' and ``plan of care'' would be revised
and incorporated into the rules concerning conditions of participation at &sect;483.202. We believe that it is important
to incorporate these critical requirements into a condition of participation so that they will be subject to survey
procedures. These requirements are discussed in a later section of this preamble. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 441.156, Team developing individual plan of care, would be deleted. The process for developing the inpatient
plan of treatment would be specified in &sect;483.202(b), Active treatment program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new &sect;441.158, Care settings, would be added to describe the settings to be used for providing this inpatient
benefit. One setting is a psychiatric hospital, the setting that has been authorized under the statute since the psychiatric
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
21 benefit was first established. We would specify psychiatric units in general hospitals as a second setting that
States can use to provide acute care. Acute psychiatric care could be provided in either of these settings when the
need for such care is certified as specified in &sect;441.152. These settings would be used when an individual has
an episode for which acute care is required, and when it is determined that this most restrictive type of care is necessary
to stabilize the patient's acute condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A third possible setting for the psychiatric
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
21 benefit would be a PRTF. The PRTF would be a new category of institutional provider under the Medicaid program and
would be limited to the provision of the psychiatric
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
21 benefit under section 1905(a)(16) of the Act. PRTFs would provide care when an individual does not require acute
care, but does require supervision and active treatment on a 24-hour inpatient basis to attain a level of functioning
that allows subsequent treatment in a less restrictive setting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PRTF setting is being specified as a new category of Medicaid provider in order to establish an alternative inpatient
setting which provides care more similar to community-based care than the care provided in psychiatric hospitals
or general hospitals. To ensure that PRTFs are community-oriented, we propose to require that these facilities coordinate
their educational activities with school curricula in their communities (&sect;483.212(a)(3)). In developing
this proposed rule we considered the possibility of limiting the size of facilities to 30 or fewer beds in order to enable
the facilities to be more appropriate in a community setting, but we are not including a proposed limit in the proposed
rule. We nevertheless welcome comments and suggestions on this subject.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The certification of need process for PRTF care is described in &sect;441.152 (a) and (b). We are proposing to establish
the requirements for PRTFs in &sect;&sect;483.210 through 483.224 of the regulations in subpart F of part 483. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PRTF would be an additional optional setting for States that choose to provide this inpatient benefit. States
that do not include PRTFs as providers under the psychiatric
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
21 benefit would still have to provide this type of care when determined to be necessary by an EPSDT screen. If such a
State does not have freestanding PRTFs, a section of a general hospital or psychiatric hospital that has been certified
as a PRTF can provide these residential services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any State that elects to provide the psychiatric
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
21 benefit would be required, at a minimum, to provide these services in a psychiatric hospital or in a psychiatric
unit in a general hospital and to have PRTF services available at least when required under EPSDT. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The maintenance of effort provision in section 1905(h)(2) of the Act is implemented in &sect;441.180 of the regulations.
The Medicaid statute provides that a State's maintenance of effort computation, which would demonstrate that the
State continues to provide the same level of funding for these services that it did before it began to receive FFP, is
to be based on data from 1971, the year before this provision was enacted. We recognize that the statute is obsolete
in this regard and we have requested a technical amendment to update this provision, but the current regulatory maintenance
of effort requirement must remain in effect until a statutory amendment is enacted. It is not necessary, however,
for States that currently offer the psychiatric
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
21 benefit to again demonstrate maintenance of effort if they wish to modify the State plan option to include PRTFs
and/or hospital psychiatric units as providers of the psychiatric
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
21 benefit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We would add a new &sect;441.160, Payment, that would specify the condition of payment for the psychiatric
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
21 benefit. For payment purposes, we propose to add PRTF services to the long-term care facility services definition
in &sect;447.251(c). In addition, we propose to apply the payment principles specified in &sect;447.250 (a) through
(c) to all providers of the psychiatric
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->

B. Requirements for Participation for Facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We propose to establish standards in subpart F of part 483 for all facilities and units that wish to participate in Medicaid
as providers of the psychiatric
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
21 benefit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed requirements relating to active treatment and the inpatient plan of treatment would apply to psychiatric
hospitals and psychiatric units in general hospitals that provide the psychiatric
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
21 benefit, as well as to PRTFs. In &sect;483.202, Active treatment program, we propose to require that the facility
provide treatment designed to enable the individual to achieve sufficient stability to progress to outpatient care,
and to attain the objectives specified in the inpatient plan of treatment that would be required in &sect;483.202(b).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 483.202(b), Inpatient plan of treatment, would require that an interdisciplinary team, which includes
a facility staff physician and at least one other professional staff person, develop the inpatient plan of treatment
which specifies the interventions to be provided for the individual. We would require that the inpatient treatment
plan include specific measurable treatment objectives and timeframes for meeting these objectives. In addition,
we would require that inpatient mental health services be coordinated with any other services being provided under
the individual's comprehensive services plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interval for review of inpatient care by the review team in acute care psychiatric
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
21 providers would be set at 7 days after admission and every 7 days thereafter. In a PRTF, reviews would be required
every 7 days in the initial month of stay; after the first month, reviews would be required at monthly intervals. We
do not believe that longer periods should elapse before the treatment modalities being used are assessed for their
effectiveness. Any necessary changes should be made as soon as possible in order to make certain that discharge occurs
at the earliest possible time.

C. PRTF Conditions of Participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In developing the proposed requirements for PRTFs, we have tried to allow flexibility for providers whenever possible,
and to avoid requiring specific documentation of administrative procedures. We recognize that policies and procedures
relating to such matters as personnel and admissions are generally necessary but we believe that facilities that
can meet the requirements specified in this proposed rule can develop these administrative procedures without additional
Federal requirements. We have made an effort to minimize the imposition of any paperwork burdens.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Facilities meeting all the requirements in subpart F of part 483 would be qualified as PRTFs to provide the psychiatric
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
21 benefit. We would require that facilities protect and promote the rights of each resident, as specified in &sect;483.211,
Resident rights. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We would require that these providers meet applicable licensure laws in States that have established licensure requirements
for this type of facility. This requirement would be specified in &sect;483.212(a)(1), Licensure and other laws.
Because it is important that the children and adolescents in the facility maintain their educational development
while they are in the facility, we would require in &sect;483.212(a)(2) that the facility coordinate its educational
activities with school curricula in the community. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We would specify at &sect;483.212(a)(3) that providers would be expected to meet the regulations issued by the Department
of Health and Human Services relating to nondiscrimination, protection of human subjects, and fraud and abuse, as
specified in 45 CFR parts 46, 80, and 84 and 42 CFR part 455. The disclosure of ownership and control requirements in
section 1126 of the Act would be applicable to these providers. The requirements for provider agreements under section
1902(a)(27) of the Act would also be applicable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We would also require that PRTFs have a governing body which would appoint an administrator to be responsible for the
general management of the facility. These requirements would be specified in &sect;483.212(b), Administrative
structure. There would be a general requirement relating to competence, academic credentials, and administrative
experience. We invite comments on whether these requirements should be more specific, and if so, what the requirements
should be. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We propose to require that the facility designate a clinical director who is at least board-eligible in psychiatry
and has experience in child and adolescent mental health. The clinical director would be responsible for the implementation
of each resident's inpatient treatment plan and for the coordination of all medical/psychiatric care in the facility.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We would require that all facilities have written procedures to use for all potential emergencies, such as fire, severe
weather, and missing residents (proposed &sect;483.218(b)). New employees would be trained in these procedures
and all staff would participate in review drills.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The facility would be required to have written transfer agreements with one or more hospitals which assure that a resident
can be transferred to an appropriate setting in a timely manner when transfer is necessary for more intensive psychiatric
care or for medical treatment (proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;483.220(a)). Necessary information relating to the resident's care would be exchanged at the time of transfer.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The facility would also be required to have an effective program for infection control (proposed &sect;483.218(c)).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each resident's dignity would be respected and facilities would be precluded in &sect;483.216, Facility practices
and resident behavior, from imposing any physical restraints or administering any psychoactive drugs for purposes
of discipline or convenience. All forms of abuse would be forbidden, including verbal, mental, sexual, and physical
abuse. Any grouping of residents would be planned to protect the safety and promote the treatment of all group members.
The facility would be required to report any alleged abuses to the administrator or to other officials in accordance
with State law. Facilities would have to retain evidence of a thorough investigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concerning staff qualifications, we would require in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;483.214(b) that the facility employ the professional, administrative and support staff necessary to implement
the inpatient plans of treatment and to carry out the applicable regulatory requirements. Professional staff could
include qualified psychiatrists and other physicians, clinical psychologists, psychiatric nurses, social workers,
substance abuse specialists, other health professionals and ancillary staff. We would require that all staff be
competent and that professional staff be appropriately licensed, certified, or registered when this is required
under State law. We would further require that professional staff not be under sanctions imposed for infractions
as specified in sections 1156, 1128, or 1892 of the Act. Services provided by nonemployees would be subject to a written
agreement that specifies the facility's and contractor's responsibilities. We invite comments as to whether this
section should contain more specific requirements concerning personnel qualifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We would require that responsible direct care staff be on duty and awake on a 24-hour basis to take prompt action in case
of injury, illness, fire, or other emergency in a facility housing residents who are aggressive, assaultive, or security
risks (&sect;483.214(a)).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The facility would be required to maintain clinical records on each resident and retain the records for at least 5 years
or any period of time required by State law. The material in the records would remain confidential except under specified
circumstances (&sect;483.212(d)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We would also require that facilities disclose ownership and control in accordance with &sect;455.104 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(&sect;483.212(c)). A facility would also have to notify the Medicaid agency within 5 days if there is a change in the
facility's ownership or administrator or clinical director. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A facility would be required to maintain a quality assurance program which monitors care provided in the facility
and to cooperate with an authorized program of independent medical evaluation, including evaluation of each resident's
need for facility care (proposed &sect;483.212(e)). PRTFs would be one type of psychiatric facility, and would therefore
be subject to the ``inspection of care'' provisions specified in subpart I of 42 CFR part 456. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 483.218, Safety provisions, contains the provisions we propose to ensure general resident safety. We propose
to require that PRTFs meet the applicable provisions of the Life Safety Code of the National Fire Protection Association
(&sect;483.218(a)). If these code provisions would result in unreasonable hardship upon facilities classified
for health care occupancy only, they could be waived by the State survey agency, but only if the waiver does not adversely
affect the health and safety of residents or staff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Refuse, including any toxic wastes generated in the facility, would have to be disposed of in accordance with applicable
Federal, State, and local laws (&sect;483.218(d)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PRTFs would be required in &sect;483.222, Dietary services, to provide dietary services that ensure that each resident
receives a diet that meets the daily nutritional needs of the resident. If a qualified dietitian is not employed on
a full time basis, the facility would be required to designate a person to serve as the director of food service. The
regulation would require menu planning, and sanitary food storage, preparation, and distribution methods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We would require that facilities provide sufficient space in the dining and program areas to enable staff to provide
the services specified in each resident's inpatient plan of treatment (&sect;483.224(a)). Residents' bedrooms
would be required to accommodate no more than four residents, and to measure at least 80 square feet per resident in
multiple resident bedrooms and at least 100 square feet in single resident rooms (&sect;483.224(b)). Variations
in these accommodation and size requirements could be allowed in individual cases when a physician providing direct
care documents that the variations are required by special needs of residents and will not adversely affect residents'
health and safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bedrooms would have to have direct access to a corridor and to have at least one window. Appropriate beds, bedding and
furniture, and accessible closet space would be required. Each resident room would need to be equipped with or located
near toilet and bathing facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dining and activities rooms would have to be well lighted and ventilated, with nonsmoking areas identified if smoking
is allowed in the facility. It is possible that, in the future, State and Federal laws may prohibit smoking in these
facilities. The facility would have to ensure that there is a sanitary and orderly interior, including clean bath
and bed linens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The facility would be required to establish procedures to ensure that water is available to essential areas when there
is a loss of normal water supply. Comfortable temperature and sound levels would have to be maintained, and adequate
ventilation would be required. The facility would have to maintain an effective pest control program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe that our proposed facility standards are reasonable and adequate for residential treatment facilities.
We welcome comments and recommendations for modifications of these proposed requirements from the general public
and especially from those who have had experience in providing these services and from residents and families of residents.

D. Technical Revision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
General provisions relating to Medicaid services are included in 42 CFR part 440. Section 440.160, Inpatient psychiatric
services for individuals under age 21, currently contains an abbreviated definition of the psychiatric
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
21 benefit. This abbreviated definition has caused confusion because it does not make it clear that this benefit must
always be provided in a psychiatric facility. Therefore, we propose to revise the definition in this section to list
the three possible settings and to cross refer to the detailed requirements in subpart D of part 441 and subpart F of
part 483. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. Collection of Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulations at &sect;441.152 contain collection of information requirements that are subject to the Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). The information collection requirements concern resident information.
The respondents who will provide the information include physicians and medical personnel. Public reporting burden
for this collection of information is estimated to be 30 minutes per respondent. A notice will be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 when approval is obtained. Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the information collection
and recordkeeping requirements should direct them to the OMB official whose name appears in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 section of this preamble.

VII. Response to Public Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of the large number of items of correspondence we normally receive on a proposed rule, we are unable to acknowledge
or respond to them individually. However, we will consider all comments that we receive by the date and time specified
in the ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
DATES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' section of this preamble to the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VIII. Regulatory Impact Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)
(5 U.S.C. 601 through 612), unless the Secretary certifies that a proposed regulation would not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, psychiatric residential treatment
facilities and psychiatric hospitals are considered to be small entities. Individuals and States are not included
in the definition of small entity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis for any final
rule that may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Such analysis
must conform to the provisions of section 603 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small
rural hospital as a hospital with fewer than 50 beds located outside a Metropolitan Statistical area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are various aspects of this proposed regulation that might have some cost or saving, but the net impact of all
of them appears to be negligible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The establishment of the psychiatric residential treatment facility as a new category of Medicaid facility for the
purposes of inpatient psychiatric care has varying impacts. On one hand, daily charges at such facilities are projected
to be lower than at psychiatric hospitals. On the other hand, lengths of stay seem to be longer, probably due to the less
acute, more chronic nature of the conditions they are designed to treat. However, if we assume that some recipients
are currently getting inappropriate care in more expensive settings merely because of Medicaid regulations, then
this regulation may save some money. This assumption, though, is impossible to verify.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Also, there currently are many facilities that are not psychiatric hospitals that are currently providing these
services under existing Medicaid regulations. It is not clear if their costs are higher than the proposed residential
treatment facilities. It is also unclear how many of them will be able to qualify under the new regulations, and what
this will do to the supply of care and its cost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In any event, it does not appear that more eligible individuals will come into the program because of this regulation.
Currently, there are approximately 42,000 recipients of services under this category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As for the implementation of requirements for comprehensive programs and coordination of State authorities concerned
with provision of mental health services, as well as the requirements for coordinated plans of care, they will probably
increase administrative costs somewhat, but will reduce program costs by ensuring that the most appropriate and
efficient form of care is utilized. The magnitude of these costs and savings is difficult to determine but probably
is negligible, given the number of recipients involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, we are not preparing analyses for either the RFA or section 1102(b) of the Act since we have determined,
and the Secretary certifies, that this proposed rule would not result in a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities and would not have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small
rural hospitals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 12866, this proposed regulation was not reviewed by the Office
of Management and Budget.
