SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Pratt
&amp; Whitney (PW) JT8D series turbofan engines, that currently requires initial and repetitive inspections of
certain front compressor fan hubs and shotpeening of the forward and aft rim to web radius. This action would reduce
the initial inspection interval for front compressor fan hubs installed in all positions of all applicable aircraft,
establish a compliance end-date, and clarify the wording of the compliance requirements. This proposal is prompted
by a report of a front compressor fan hub fracture installed in a Boeing 737 aircraft that resulted in the release of
fan blades and portions of the hub outer rim. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent fracture
of the front compressor fan hub, which can result in an uncontained engine failure and damage to the aircraft.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On July 15, 1993, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued Airworthiness Directive (AD) 93&hyph;14&hyph;14,
Amendment 39&hyph;8638 (58 FR 39644, July 26, 1993), applicable to Pratt &amp; Whitney (PW) JT8D series turbofan
engines, to require initial and repetitive inspections for cracks, and removal from service, if necessary, of certain
front compressor fan hubs. Front compressor fan hubs installed on engines in the No. 2 position on Boeing 727 aircraft
must be inspected according to a more aggressive schedule than other installations. In addition, that AD requires
shotpeening of the forward and aft rim to web radius area of hubs that pass the inspections. That action was prompted
by reports of two front compressor fan hub fractures on engines operating in the No. 2 position on Boeing 727 aircraft.
That condition, if not corrected, could result in a fracture of the front compressor fan hub, which can result in an
uncontained engine failure and damage to the aircraft. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the issuance of that AD, the FAA has received a report of a front compressor fan hub fracture on a PW JT8D engine
installed on a Boeing 737 aircraft. The examination of the failed hardware revealed the failure mechanism to be identical
to that described in AD 93&hyph;14&hyph;14. The analysis conducted for that AD concluded that the vibratory stress
environment that caused fan hub fractures was the most severe for engines installed in the No. 2 position on Boeing
727 aircraft. Therefore, the FAA addressed this population in a more aggressive manner than engines installed in
other aircraft, or in the No. 1 or No. 3 position on Boeing 727 aircraft. The FAA determined that a similar, but less severe
stress environment existed in engines installed in other aircraft or positions other than the No. 2 position in the
Boeing 727 aircraft, and inspection and shotpeening requirements were specified for these engines in AD 93&hyph;14&hyph;14.
Since the failure of the fan hub installed in the Boeing 737 aircraft, the FAA has reassessed the risk analysis for all
installations and determined that the predicted risk level should be reduced. Therefore, the FAA proposes to supersede
AD 93&hyph;14&hyph;14 with a reduced initial fan hub inspection requirement for engines installed in all positions
of all applicable aircraft, by requiring engines removed from the Boeing 727 aircraft No. 2 position to adhere to the
Boeing 727 aircraft No. 2 position inspection requirements, and by establishing a compliance end-date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has received comments from operators that the wording of paragraph (b)(4) of AD 93&hyph;14&hyph;14 is confusing.
The FAA has revised the wording to emphasize that the repetitive inspection is required at the next opportunity when
the front compressor fan hub is accessible at the detail level in the shop only after accumulating 2,500 additional
cycles in service (CIS) since the last inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the FAA has revised the wording in paragraph (d) that defines a shop visit as an engine removal for engine
maintenance that cannot be performed while installed in the aircraft. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since publication of AD 93&hyph;14&hyph;14, PW has issued Alert Service Bulletin (ASB) No. 6104, Revision 3, dated
June 16, 1994, that describes the reduced initial inspection intervals for the applicable engine installations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 93&hyph;14&hyph;14 to reduce the initial inspection interval for front
compressor fan hubs installed in all positions of all applicable aircraft, revise the compliance requirements for
repositioned engines, establish a compliance end-date, and clarify the wording of the compliance requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 1475 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry and 690 domestic uninstalled engines would
be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 12 work hours per engine to accomplish the proposed
actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed
AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,428,900. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Part 70 contains regulations requiring States to develop, and submit to EPA for approval, programs for issuing operating
permits to major, and certain other, stationary sources of air pollution. The minimum elements of operating permits
programs are contained in part 70 which was promulgated on July 21, 1992 (57 FR 32250).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subsequent to promulgation of part 70, nearly 20 entities, including State and local governments, environmental
groups, and industry associations, petitioned for judicial review of the part 70 regulations. One of the key aspects
of the litigation and of an operating permits program is the system for revising permits to incorporate changes at
permitted sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several requests for an extension of the comment period on the proposal notice have been received to allow time for
preparation of comments primarily on how to fashion a more workable permit revision system. Because of the complexity
of the proposed revisions, potential commenters assert that the 90-comment period provided is not long enough to
prepare comprehensive comments on the permit revision system as well as all the other proposed revisions. An additional
45 days is therefore being provided for development and submittal of comments.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of September 28, 1994 (59 FR 49484), EPA published an ANPR for significant new uses of lead issued under section 5(a)(2)
of TSCA. Significant new use rules for lead would require persons to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing the
manufacture, import, or processing of lead and lead compounds for uses identified by the Agency as significant new
uses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA issued this ANPR to: (1) Communicate its intention to regulate significant new uses of elemental lead and lead
compounds; (2) identify components of its proposed regulatory approach; (3) request comment on issues related to
this approach; and (4) request comment and information on existing uses of lead that would help support EPA's selection
of proposed criteria for defining significant new uses of lead. Written comments on the ANPR were to be received on
or before November 28, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has received several requests from trade associations seeking a 60&hyph;day extension of the public comment
period because of additional time needed to provide EPA with information requested in the ANPR. EPA believes that
providing an additional 60&hyph;day period to prepare written comments is reasonable. The Agency, therefore, is
extending the comment period 60 days in order to give all interested persons the opportunity to comment fully. Written
and electronic comments submitted in response to the ANPR must be received on or before January 27, 1995.

 This notice responds to a notice of request for comments that NHTSA published in 1993 implementing the grant of a petition
by Robert Bosch GmbH. It proposes an amendment to the Federal motor vehicle standard on lighting that would permit
replaceable lenses on integral beam and replaceable bulb headlamps that incorporate on-board headlamp aimers,
provided that such headlamps meet more rigorous environmental tests. The benefit of headlamps with replaceable
lenses is that the lens or reflector could be replaced in the event of breakage of either without the present necessity
to replace both components if only one is damaged.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On August 12, 1993, NHTSA published a Notice of Request for Comments in implementation of a grant of a petition for rulemaking
submitted by Robert Bosch GmbH (58 FR 42924). The notice sought views relevant to a decision on whether to proceed with
rulemaking to amend Standard No. 108 to allow the lens to be replaceable on a replaceable bulb headlamp equipped with
an on-vehicle aiming device. In addition to comments on the five benefits ascribed by Bosch to replaceable lens headlamps,
NHTSA asked for comments on fifteen relevant issues. The reader is referred to the notice for further information.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments were submitted by 21 interested persons: Advocates for Highway Safety (Advocates), American Automobile
Manufacturers Association (AAMA), American Honda, Fiat Auto R&amp;D USA, Ford Motor Company, General Electric
Worldwide Automotive Lighting (GE), General Motors Corp. (GM), Hella KG Hueck &amp; Co., KC Hilites, Koito Manufacturing
Co. Inc., Oscar Lidstrom, Jr., Maine Bureau of Highway Safety, Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles, Mercedes-Benz
of North America, Osram Sylvania, Inc., PACCAR, Inc., Stanley Electric Co. Ltd., Virginia State Police, Volkswagen
of North America (on behalf of itself and Audi), Volvo of North America, and J. L. Witt. The concept of replaceable lenses
for certain headlamps was opposed by three commenters: Advocates, GE, and KC Hilites. Six others expressed reservations:
AAMA, GM, Maine, Massachusetts, Stanley, and Koito. The remaining 12 commenters either actively supported the concept
or submitted comments that did not indicate opposition to it. Where appropriate, these comments are mentioned in
the discussion of issues that follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA's evaluation of the comments that were submitted has synthesized agency concerns into three issues: the photometric
performance of headlamps after relensing, the durability performance of headlamps before and after relensing,
and the economic benefits to the consumer of replaceable lens headlamps. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Photometric Performance of Headlamps After Relensing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The first issue of concern is whether a headlamp with a replaceable lens will provide photometric performance equivalent
to a headlamp using the original lens. NHTSA had previously denied two petitions (from GM and BMW of North America)
for replaceable lens headlamps, principally from concern for potential aiming problems and corroded reflectors.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential for misaim has two bases. The first is relevant to mechanically aimable headlamps, which have three
alignment pads on the lens to orient alignment tools. Some designs use pads ground to the individual characteristics
of each reflector/lens assembly. This creates lamp-to-lamp differences in lenses, irrelevant when the lens is permanently
attached to the reflector assembly, but of possible concern when lenses may be replaced. Even in designs without custom
ground pads, continuation of proper aim is dependent upon the repeatability of the attachment of the lens to the reflector.
Small differences in fit or gasket crush could modify the interaction between the reflector and the lens and thereby
reorient the aiming pads. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The aiming pad issue does not arise under the Bosch petition because it includes only headlamps with on-board aiming
devices, which aim the reflector without reference to the lens. Bosch provided data from photometric tests demonstrating
that, absent the aiming pad considerations, headlamp photometry was insensitive to lens replacement. The illumination
at required test points produced by the test reflector and bulb was nearly identical in each test, using five replaceable
lenses with different production dates. The differences between lenses of the same part number and any variations
in lens alignment due to repeated replacement had no apparent effect on the photometric performance of the combination
of new components.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Advocates had criticized the minimum ``above-horizontal'' illumination requirements established by the agency
for 1994 and newer model vehicle headlamps as providing poorer performance than that of sealed beam headlamps. It
opposed lens replacement on the basis of a potential for a further reduction in ``above-horizontal'' illumination
which it believed would result from deviations in lens alignment during replacement. The Bosch data should allay
Advocates' concern, as should a comment by Osram Sylvania that headlamp photometry is not sensitive to the slight
misalignments possible during lens replacement. Although Osram Sylvania had other criticisms of replaceable lenses,
it reported that common design practices for replaceable bulb headlamps limit the sensitivity of photometric performance
to lens misalignment and that replacement lenses need not be identical to original lenses to maintain equivalent
photometric performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, comments and data submitted to the docket are persuasive that photometric performance of new lamps is
not sensitive to typical production variations of replacement lenses. For the reasons expressed above, it appears
that headlamps with on-vehicle aiming and replaceable lenses are equivalent in photometric performance to headlamps
with on-vehicle aiming and bonded lenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Durability Performance of Headlamps Before and After Relensing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For new headlamps, Standard No. 108's tests for dust penetration, corrosion, humidity, vibration, and water sealing
should assure that headlamps with replaceable lenses will have a lens-to-reflector sealing that is equivalent to
the protection provided by headlamps with bonded lens/reflector assemblies. However, if the reflector of a headlamp
is affected by exposure during the period when the vehicle is operated with a broken lens or by improper cleaning attempts
during relensing, there is a strong possibility that an owner may continue to use the unit after relensing without
being aware of its degraded performance. Less than half of all states have periodic vehicle inspection, and those
that do differ in their rigor. Thus, inspection programs cannot be expected to detect the decreased photometric performance
of headlamps with degraded reflectors. The second potential problem is that the lens-seal integrity could be lost
during relensing, and that an otherwise good reflector would be subject to moisture and dust for the remaining life
of the vehicle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reflector degradation was not a concern before 1983 when replaceable bulb headlamps were allowed. In a sealed beam
lamp, a crack in the lens large enough to admit moisture would cause the filament to fail, necessitating the replacement
of the entire headlamp. However, replaceable bulb headlamps can continue to operate despite a broken lens, and the
possibility of degraded reflectors was considered by the agency during the course of rulemaking that allowed them.
The requirement for a bonded lens was motivated in part by NHTSA's desire to avoid creating a potential safety problem
that had been impossible when Standard No. 108 allowed only sealed beam headlamps. It is a conservative requirement
that results in the replacement of reflectors when the condition of the lens indicates possible long term exposure
of the reflector to water and dirt. Even a small hole can cause the headlamp to fill with water due to condensation during
the heating and cooling cycle of lamp use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A potential safety disadvantage of the bonded lens requirement is that the cost of replacing a headlamp rather than
a lens may tend to delay or to discourage repair altogether. However, the desire to maintain the aesthetic quality
of a newer vehicle and the obvious performance problem of a cracked lamp containing moisture should motivate many
owners to make a replacement, even if costly. A more powerful motivation is provided by the vehicle inspection programs
maintained by less than half of the states. Typically, the states inspect for aim and for damaged lenses, and in some
instances inspect replaceable bulbs for maximum power to prevent the use of high powered ``off road'' aftermarket
bulbs. But even strict states, such as Virginia, do not inspect for the low light output that would identify headlamps
with degraded reflectors. Many commenters who favored the concept of replaceable lenses voiced concerns about the
potential loss of performance of relensed units. AAMA suggested replaceable lenses for integral beam headlamps
as well as for those with replaceable bulbs, but it commented that any rulemaking allowing replaceable lenses must
assure that reflectors are designed to be more resistant to abrasion and solvents, with special durability and environmental
qualification requirements added. American Honda was concerned about technical problems which may exist in ensuring
that photometric performance is equal to the level of performance before the lens was damaged, and ensuring adequate
sealing against dust and moisture after the lens alone is replaced. GE commented that the average consumer or automotive
mechanic does not have the background and understanding to make the decisions necessary to determine if a headlamp
is safely repairable. Osram Sylvania agreed with the Bosch petition that reflector surfaces can be cleaned during
lens replacement, but it cautioned that the reflector can be damaged by improper cleaning and handling. It also advised
that the touch of human hands can deposit skin oil on the reflector with the possible consequences of reflector fogging,
reduced output and increased glare. It further commented that the lens replacement process could break the sealing
coat, protecting the thin aluminum coating on the reflector from moisture, which could lead to a very rapid loss of
reflecting area and photometric performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Volkswagen's comments also responded to questions about performance loss of relensed lamps. It suggested that only
specially trained dealer service personnel should install lenses, presumably refusing to relens degraded lamps,
and that state inspections should monitor the condition of reflectors. These steps may be feasible in Europe where
reflector corrosion, at least in older designs, is a problem requiring universal inspection and where the manufacturers
control the replacement lens supply. But they are not effective in the United States. Less than half the States have
inspections, and those that do are not required to cover the condition of the reflector because it was never a concern
during the long era in which sealed beams were the only type of headlamps allowed. Also, the U.S. aftermarket would
not be limited to OEM lenses (conferring on dealers the power to refuse to repair degraded lamps) because non-OEM manufacturers
would be free to manufacture components and sell them directly to vehicle owners.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Volkswagen and American Honda commented that replaceable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lens headlamps could be designed to require removal of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
headlamp from the vehicle in order to replace the lens. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would have the effect, desirable to the commenters, of causing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owners to rely on the vehicle manufacturer's dealers for lens 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replacement. However, causing lens replacement to be more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expensive and less convenient diminishes the prospect of greater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
headlamp maintenance in states without inspection. Further, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owners compelled by state inspection to replace parts often 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insist on making their own repairs to minimize their burden. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Making the task unnecessarily complex only increases the chances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the owner will make a poor repair. In the case of HID 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
integral beam headlamps, easy removal of the lens without

disturbing the other components may reduce high voltage hazards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during owner repairs. The better solution, suggested by the AAMA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and others, is to adopt durability and environmental requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for replaceable lens headlamps to increase the likelihood that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relensed headlamps will perform satisfactorily regardless of who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services them. This solution minimizes the potential loss of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance from degraded reflectors and maximizes the potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for inexpensive voluntary lens repairs in states without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The most detailed comments to the question of reflector 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
durability were those of Ford Motor Company. They contain a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comprehensive statement of the reflector durability problem and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some general guidance concerning appropriate test procedures.

Replaceable bulb headlamps currently incorporate reflective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surfaces not specifically designed to withstand direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental exposure or abrasion. If the condition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prompting replacement of a lens has resulted in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contamination or discoloration of the reflector surface 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e.g., as might occur due to a lens crack or loss of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
integrity of the lens/reflector seal), a degradation in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
photometric performance would be expected, as compared to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new replacement headlamp. Attempts to clean a contaminated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflector, as by wiping, could result in abrasion to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
metallized surface, possibly resulting in degraded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
photometric performance and/or increased glare. Ford 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore recommends that rulemaking on replaceable lens 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
headlamps consider the need for the reflective surfaces of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replaceable lens headlamps to withstand appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental exposure and cleaning operations.

Ford recommends that headlamps with replaceable lenses, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition to present requirements applicable to replaceable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bulb headlamps, be subjected to salt-fog, moisture and dust 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure without the lens in place. Additionally, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflector surface should be capable of withstanding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resistance to chemicals that are likely to be used by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumers or repair facilities to clean contaminated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflector surfaces. Subsequent to appropriate environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and chemical exposure, the reflector should be cleaned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
according to a prescribed procedure. When fitted with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lens following exposure and cleaning, the headlamp should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capable of meeting the same photometric requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to replaceable bulb headlamps with bonded lenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aftermarket lens manufacturers should be required to certify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that any headlamp for which the lens is intended is capable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of meeting photometric requirements when fitted with a lens 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of that design. Additionally, aftermarket replacement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lenses should be accompanied with complete instructions for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properly removing the old lens, cleaning the interior of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
headlamp body, cleaning and preparing the mating surface on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the headlamp body and installing the new lens on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The durability and environmental requirements for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present replaceable bulb headlamps and the deliberations that led 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to them may be useful in considering reasonable requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the reflectors of replaceable lens headlamps. When the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended Standard No. 108 to permit replaceable bulb headlamps, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was aware that German vehicle inspection data showed significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rejections due to dull, corroded and damaged headlamp reflectors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, NHTSA promulgated an appropriate test of corrosion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resistance for replaceable bulb headlamps for use in the United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States. The lamp assembly must be exposed for ten days in a salt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spray chamber, with the additional requirement than the bulb be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removed and the spray deactivated during the last hour of all but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two test days. The test put a premium on the ability of the lens 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to protect the reflector from the salt spray. It also required a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
degree of direct corrosion resistance exceeding the performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of some European headlamps by having the lamps exposed to several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hours of salty air in the chamber without direct spray. In its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
original form, the rule required that the headlamp pass the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
photometric test at the completion of the corrosion test. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
post-exposure photometric test was later eliminated because of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the possibility of salt deposits that could not be removed easily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from a headlamp with a bonded lens.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A corrosion test of increased rigor for reflectors of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replaceable lens headlamps would remove much of the safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concern about relensing lamps that have become contaminated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dust and moisture. The agency is proposing a specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental test for reflectors of replaceable lens headlamps 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which it believes is consistent with Ford's recommendations while 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposing minimum testing burdens. NHTSA is proposing an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional salt spray test with the following features for new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replaceable lens headlamps: (a) A 24 hour exposure to salt spray 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the lens removed, (b) a 48 hour drying period, (c) cleaning of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the reflector according to instructions to be furnished with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replacement lenses and included in the owner's manual, (d) a non-magnified examination for corrosion, and (e) a photometric
test of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the headlamp as reassembled with a new lens. The proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposed reflector test mimics the existing test of headlamps with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lenses but with a much reduced duration since reflector exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in service would not be continuous. However, it makes use of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected salt deposit formation to test the durability of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflector coating to cleaning. Finally, it would require the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer of a headlamp with a replaceable lens to demonstrate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
photometric compliance of the reassembled cleansed lamp. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ford recommended three distinct tests of headlamp reflector 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure to salt-fog, moisture, and dust, while the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposes a single test. Comment from parties familiar with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflector construction and exposure testing is sought. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following questions are of particular interest: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A cracked lens frequently causes a headlamp to partially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fill with water. Is the moisture and exposure time involved in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an ASTM B 117&hyph;73 salt spray test sufficient to test moisture 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resistance of reflectors? If not, what test would be sufficient? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The present dust test for replaceable bulb headlamps 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uses Portland cement as dust, and the agency presumes that Ford's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment refers to the same kind of dust test. Cleaning the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflector after Portland cement dust exposure may be equivalent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to a rigorous abrasion test. The agency believes that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed salt-spay test will coat the headlamp reflector with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
salt deposits and that the subsequent cleaning will provide an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate abrasion test. However, does a 24-hour salt spray test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deposit enough salt to act as a de facto abrasion test? Should a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular method of salt removal be required or should the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers' cleaning instructions dictate the test procedure, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as proposed? Is a Portland cement dust test as well as a salt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spray test of reflectors needed, and if so, why? Should a direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
abrasion test be used rather than the indirect abrasion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleaning, and if so, what procedure would be appropriate? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Is the proposed 24-hour salt spray test followed by 48 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hours drying time sufficient to test the headlamp reflectors and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the metal light shields sometimes used? What corrosion criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are appropriate for light shields? Can rusty water dripping from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
metal light shields eventually cause otherwise durable headlamp 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflectors to fail because of stains? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The present standard for replaceable bulb headlamps 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposes lamp assemblies with the bulb removed (but the lens 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attached) for eight hours to humid salty air in a salt spray 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chamber with the salt spray turned off. Is this present test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(followed by a photometric test and whatever cleaning is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary) sufficient to qualify headlamp reflectors for use with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replaceable lenses without the proposed direct salt spray test or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the moisture, dust and salt spray tests recommended by Ford? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The existing Standard No. 108 also includes a chemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resistance test of the exterior of the lamp to fuel, tar remover, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
power steering fluid and antifreeze. NHTSA has tentatively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concluded that the test should be extended to headlamp reflectors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using chemicals suggested by the manufacturer in the cleaning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructions or with a realistic probability of use by vehicle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owners despite the manufacturer's instructions. Chemicals in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
latter category would include tar remover, lacquer thinner and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mineral spirits. The manufacturer's instructions may concentrate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on water soluble contaminants because of the salt spray test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The inclusion of the other chemicals gives the owner a means to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remove organic contaminants without resorting to abrasion. Since 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mineral spirits is a major constituent of tar remover, a separate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test for mineral spirits appears unnecessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The plastic lenses on replaceable bulb headlamps 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufactured for use in the United States are given a hard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protective coating that would be expected to exceed the reflector 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coating requirements established by the proposed tests. NHTSA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expects that similar coating methods could be used to create 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
robust reflectors for replaceable lens headlamps. It would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable to expect successful lens replacement by vehicle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owners, especially if the lens attachments were designed to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accessible without disturbing the headlamp aim. The requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for headlamp reflector durability also reduces concern about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
untrained persons installing the lens seal. Should an owner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
install the seal incorrectly, causing moisture to collect inside 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the lamp, the reflector will not degrade quickly. The visible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moisture would serve as a telltale, and an owner motivated to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replace the lens initially would be motivated to disassemble, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clean and reinstall the lens until the desired repair was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
successful. If manufacturers choose to design headlamps for ease 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and economy of lens replacement by owners, the prospect of better 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lamp maintenance in non-inspection States is realistic.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The cost to replace two replaceable bulb headlamps can equal 10 percent of the value of an entire car after it is 5 to 8
years old. Consumers used to the cost of sealed beam headlamps are critical of state vehicle inspection programs when
they force the replacement of headlamps at costs which far exceed those of sealed beams. When Standard No. 108 was amended
to permit replaceable bulb headlamps, the economic consequences of lens/reflector assembly replacement were not
considered to be relevant to safety, and the ability to replace the light source gave some promise of consumer benefit.
Ironically, the economic burden to consumers now fuels a safety debate about whether the reluctance of owners to replace
expensive cracked lamps or the possibility of degraded performance of relensed lamps is the greater threat to safety.
The styling benefits of replaceable bulb headlamps over sealed beams have resulted in large potential cost penalties
and an unquantifiable degree of performance loss when the headlamps are damaged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Volkswagen commented that the cost to replace a headlamp is 7 to 8 times that of the lens alone. It cited examples of lamps
costing $215 to $270 and estimated the cost of replaceable lenses in the $30 to $40 range. Mercedes estimated the cost
of replaceable lenses at $126 to $150 and complete headlamps at $250 to $640 with on-board aiming. While the cost of
headlamps with the fasteners, gaskets, and indexing features required for replaceable lens designs would be higher
than the cost of headlamps with simple bonded lenses, reductions in repair costs of 50% to 85% appear to be likely. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency anticipates that replaceable lens designs would be attractive only for headlamps using glass lenses.
These are predominantly used on imported vehicles. Replaceable bulb headlamps which have coated polycarbonate
plastic lenses are extremely resistant to cracking and chipping. AAMA commented that the impact resistance of plastic
lenses significantly reduces any servicing need to provide replaceable lenses. Glass lenses are less expensive
than coated plastic lenses, and they have greater resistance to high operating temperatures and abrasion by headlamp
wipers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the additional cost of a replaceable lens design would probably negate the economic advantage a manufacturer
might achieve by changing to a less expensive replaceable glass lens when it had been using bonded plastic lenses.
It is likely that the market for replaceable bulb headlamps with replaceable lenses would be confined to a small segment
of the import market in which headlamp wipers or high operating temperatures dictate the choice of glass lenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bosch's petition covered only replaceable bulb headlamps. However, AAMA commented that a greater economic benefit
of replaceable lenses could be found in integral beam headlamps. High Intensity Discharge (HID) lamps are being developed
for use as integral beam headlamps, and their operating temperatures are expected to dictate the use of glass lenses.
An integral beam headlamp is required to be manufactured with the lens, bulb, reflector, cable and high voltage source
configured as an indivisible whole. HID headlamps are much more costly than replaceable bulb headlamps, and the prospect
of replacing the whole lamp (at perhaps $1000) in order to repair a cracked lens may be a significant impediment to introduction
of the technology. Since the industry-imposed economic burden on the consumer is the agency's primary reason for
considering replaceable lens headlamps, it is appropriate to include integral beam headlamps in the proposal.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA is implementing its conclusions by proposing appropriate amendments to Standard No. 108. As noted above, the
proposed amendments cover integral beam headlamps as well as those with replaceable bulbs. The proposal requires
redefinitions of ``integral beam headlamp'' and ``replaceable bulb headlamp'' to clarify that some types of these
headlamps need not have a bonded lens reflector assembly, those with a vehicle headlamp aiming device (VHAD) conforming
to Standard No. 108. Under the proposal, each replacement lens would also have to be accompanied by an appropriate
replacement seal, and instructions to the user on how to remove and replace the lens, clean the reflector, and seal
the lens to the lamp. Manufacturers of replacement lenses would mark them with a DOT symbol which will be the manufacturer's
certification that installation of the lens on the headlamp for which it is intended will not create a noncompliance
with Standard No. 108. A new section is proposed that would add the chemical and corrosion resistance tests discussed
above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The greatest impact of the proposal will be on future HID integral beam headlamps which may require heat resistant
glass lenses rather than impact resistant plastic lenses. These head-lamps will be very costly and their replacement
will involve high voltage components. The development of durable reflectors to make them suitable for replaceable
lens will be an important step in making HID lamps practical. Additionally, should future changes to the standard
accommodate HID light sources in replaceable bulb headlamps, the ability to have replaceable lenses would enhance
their economic viability as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments suggest that it is not critical to require replacement lenses to be identical to original lenses in order
to maintain photometric performance in compliance with the standard. The only necessary requirement is that the
replacement lens maintain compliance of an otherwise compliant headlamp in all respects including sealing. An additional
practical requirement is that a replacement lens be supplied with a new seal and instructions for cleaning the reflector
and installing the lens and seal.

This action has not been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. It has been determined that the rulemaking action is
not significant under Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures. The purpose of the rulemaking
action is to afford a further optional means of compliance with the headlamp requirements of Standard No. 108. While
a final rule could result in higher prices for buyers of glass-lensed headlamps of certain types, these initial costs
could be offset by reduced repair costs during the life of the vehicle or the headlamp. These cost impacts are not deemed
significant and preparation of a full regulatory evaluation is not warranted.

The agency has also considered the impacts of this rulemaking action in relation to the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
I certify that this rulemaking action would not have a significant economic impact upon a substantial number of small
entities. Accordingly, no regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared. Manufacturers of motor vehicles
and headlamps, those affected by the rulemaking action, are generally not small businesses within the meaning of
the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Further, small organizations and governmental jurisdictions would not be significantly
affected because the price of new vehicles and the optional headlamps would be only minimally impacted. While the
price of new vehicle equipment might be somewhat higher if the optional headlamp is used, the cost of repair of such
equipment will be significantly lessened.

to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

A final rule based on this proposal would not have any retroactive effect. Under 49 U.S.C. 30103 (formerly section
103(d) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1392(d)), whenever a Federal motor vehicle
safety standard is in effect, a state may not adopt or maintain a safety standard applicable to the same aspect of performance
which is not identical to the Federal standard. Section 30163 (formerly 15 U.S.C. 1394) sets forth a procedure for
judicial review of final rules establishing, amending or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards. That
section does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before
parties may file suit in court.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS has determined that Deer Creek summer steelhead in Washington do not constitute a ``species'' under the Endangered
Species Act of 1973, as amended, (ESA) and, therefore, do not qualify for listing under the ESA at this time. However,
Deer Creek summer steelhead are part of a larger evolutionarily significant unit (ESU) that may warrant listing under
the ESA, and for which a status review is currently underway.

) as an endangered species and to designate critical habitat under the ESA. NMFS published a notice on December 23,
1993 (58 FR 68108), that the petition presented substantial information indicating that the listing may be warranted.
To ensure a comprehensive status review, NMFS solicited information and data concerning the present and historic
status of the Deer Creek summer steelhead population and whether this population qualifies as a ``species'' under
the ESA. NMFS also requested information on areas that may qualify as critical habitat for Deer Creek summer steelhead.
NMFS also initiated an expanded status review for all coastal steelhead in California, Oregon, and Washington. This
status review was expanded to include Idaho in response to a petition submitted by the Oregon Natural Resources Council
and 15 co-petitioners. NMFS initiated the status review for steelhead throughout its range in the four states on May
27, 1994 (59 FR 27527).

Biological Background

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NMFS Northwest Fisheries Science Center Biological Review Team has conducted a status review and prepared an
administrative report summarizing the conclusions of the status review, ``Conclusions of the Northwest Fisheries
Science Center's Review of a Petition to List Deer Creek Summer Steelhead (North Fork Stillaguamish River, Washington)
under the U.S. Endangered Species Act,'' which provides more detailed information, discussion, and references.
This report is available upon request (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deer Creek is a tributary of the North Fork Stillaguamish River in Washington. The Deer Creek Watershed covers 177

 in the North Cascade Mountains of Washington. Deer Creek and its steelhead fishery have been the subject of many sporting
journal articles and popular literature. Logging in the Deer Creek Basin began in the 1920s. Timber harvest activities
accelerated in the early 1950s, and approximately 48 percent of the basin was clear-cut between 1952 and 1985. In 1984,
a large landslide, which remains active despite restoration efforts, introduced a tremendous amount of sediment
into Deer Creek. The 1984 landslide reduced viable spawning and rearing habitat for the summer steelhead population,
which was already in decline.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The name steelhead refers to the anadromous form of rainbow trout. Recently, the scientific name for the biological
species that includes both steelhead and rainbow trout was changed from

. This change reflects a belief that all trouts from western North America share a common lineage with Pacific salmon.
The present endemic distribution of steelhead extends from the Kamchatka Peninsula, Asia, east and south, along
the Pacific coast of North America, to Malibu Creek in southern California.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Steelhead exhibit a wide variety of life history strategies. In general, steelhead migrate to sea after spending
2 years in fresh water and then spend 2 years in the ocean prior to returning to fresh water to spawn. Deviations from
this basic pattern are common. Some spawners survive and return to the ocean for 1 or more years between spawning migrations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Steelhead exhibit two spawning migration strategies. ``Summer steelhead'' enter fresh water between May and October,
and begin their spawning migration in a sexually immature state. After several months in fresh water, summer steelhead
mature and spawn. ``Winter steelhead'' enter fresh water between November and April with well developed gonads.
In drainages with sympatric populations of summer and winter steelhead, there may or may not be temporal or spatial
separation of spawning.

Consideration as a ``Species'' Under the ESA
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To qualify for listing as a threatened or endangered species, Deer Creek summer steelhead would have to be a ``species''
under the ESA. The ESA defines a ``species'' to include any ``distinct population segment of any species of vertebrate
*** which interbreeds when mature.'' NMFS published a policy (56 FR 58612, November 20, 1991) on how it will apply the
ESA ``species'' definition to Pacific salmonid species, including steelhead. This policy provides that a salmon
population will be considered distinct, and hence a species under the ESA, if it represents an evolutionarily significant
unit (ESU) of the biological species. The population must satisfy two criteria to be considered an ESU: (1) It must
be substantially reproductively isolated from other conspecific population units and (2) it must represent an important
component in the evolutionary legacy of the biological species. The first criterion, reproductive isolation, need
not be absolute, but must be strong enough to permit evolutionarily important differences to accrue in different
population units. The second criterion is met if the population contributes substantially to the ecological/genetic
diversity of the species as a whole. Further guidance on the application of this policy is contained in ``Pacific salmon

 spp.) and the Definition of Species under the Endangered Species Act,'' which is available upon request (see

Reproductive Isolation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the Stillaguamish River Basin, three summer-run stocks and one winter-run steelhead stock are recognized. Run
timing is similar among the Stillaguamish River Basin summer steelhead stocks; however, spawn timing appears to
be later for Deer Creek summer steelhead than for other summer steelhead populations within the basin. Although run
timing differs between the Stillaguamish River summer and winter steelhead stocks, there is substantial overlap
in the time of spawning of the two run types.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It was commonly thought that the high gradient reach of Deer Creek between approximately river kilometer 2.4 and 7.2
comprised a ``cumulative velocity barrier'' to winter steelhead (C. Kramer, Area Fish Biologist, Washington Department
of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW), pers. comm., May and July 1994). However, other evidence suggests that this barrier may
not be permanent, and recent flooding may have shifted the Deer Creek bedload sufficiently to facilitate passage
of winter steelhead, thereby allowing for the possibility that summer steelhead are not reproductively isolated
from winter steelhead.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, genetic studies of coastal steelhead populations have demonstrated that summer and winter steelhead
from the same stream tend to resemble one another genetically more than they resemble populations with similar run
timing from different drainages. These results suggest that summer and winter steelhead do not represent two independent
monophyletic units. Allendorf (1975) reported that coastal summer steelhead, including the Deer Creek population,
were ``genetically indistinguishable from the coastal winter run populations.'' A more recent study (Phelps

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., in press) involving a larger set of gene loci found some evidence of differentiation between summer and winter steelhead
in the Puget Sound region. The later study also found that Deer Creek summer steelhead are ``relatively distinct''
from other Puget Sound steelhead and show a higher degree of genetic similarity to winter steelhead from the Stillaguamish
and Skykomish rivers than to other summer steelhead populations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A variety of out-of-basin steelhead stocks have been released in the Puget Sound area, and summer steelhead of Columbia
River (Skamania stock) origin have been released in the North Fork Stillaguamish River since the 1960s (C. Kramer,
WDFW, pers. comm., May and July 1994). However, recent genetic data (Phelps

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

. in press) found no evidence that Deer Creek summer steelhead have been substantially affected by these releases.

Ecological/Genetic Diversity
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In Oregon, only three coastal basins have naturally-occurring summer steelhead (Siletz, Umpqua, and Rogue basins).
In contrast, all major river basins in the North Puget Sound region (Nooksack/Samish, Skagit, Stillaguamish, and
Snohomish basins) are known to have naturally-occurring summer steelhead. The discontinuous range of coastal summer
steelhead is consistent with the polyphyletic origin of this life history inferred from genetic data. However, the
Puget Sound region is (or was) conducive to the development of the summer steelhead life history, and within the Puget
Sound region, Deer Creek is not unique, or even unusual, in supporting summer-run steelhead.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The most common age structure for coastal steelhead from British Columbia to California is 2/2 (2 years of freshwater
residence followed by 2 years in the ocean). Specific information about the age structure of steelhead in the Puget
Sound region is limited. Based on scale samples from fish caught by anglers, Deer Creek summer steelhead are reported
to be primarily (95 percent) 2/1, with the remainder being 3/1 (C. Kramer, WDFW, pers. comm., May and July 1994). Other
Puget Sound steelhead, both summer- and winter-run, also have the 2/1 life history, but sampling has not been sufficient
to quantitatively describe age structure in these populations. According to anecdotal information, the adult size
at spawning of other summer steelhead stocks (South Fork Nooksack, Finney Creek, Sauk River, and Canyon Creek) is
similar to Deer Creek summer steelhead, and this suggests that other steelhead populations in the Puget Sound region
share the same adult body size and other life history features with Deer Creek summer steelhead.

Determination
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Deer Creek summer steelhead appear to be temporally and spatially isolated from other populations of summer steelhead
in the Stillaguamish River Basin. Genetic data support the hypothesis that Deer Creek summer steelhead are isolated
from other Puget Sound steelhead populations for which data are available. However, some uncertainty remains regarding
the relationship between Deer Creek summer steelhead and nearby winter-run populations, both in the Stillaguamish
River and, perhaps, in upper Deer Creek. Despite this uncertainty, NMFS has concluded, based on all available information,
that Deer Creek summer steelhead probably meet the first criterion to be an ESU_that is, substantial reproductive
isolation from other conspecific populations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the genetic data show that Deer Creek summer steelhead are relatively distinct from other Puget Sound steelhead,
the genetic differences are not large in an absolute sense. Therefore, these genetic differences provide little
insight into the second ESU criterion, contribution to ecological/genetic diversity of the species as a whole. Deer
Creek summer steelhead differ from many other coastal steelhead populations in that most of the adults return after
only 1 year in the ocean, but the limited available information indicates that this is also observed in other Puget
Sound steelhead populations. NMFS found no other phenotypic or life history traits, or habitat features, that distinguish
the Deer Creek summer steelhead population from those in adjacent areas. Therefore, NMFS concludes that Deer Creek
summer steelhead do not meet the second criterion to be considered an ESU and are not, by themselves, a ``species''
under the ESA. Therefore, a proposal to list Deer Creek summer steelhead under the ESA is not warranted at this time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, Deer Creek summer steelhead are undoubtedly part of a larger ESU that may warrant listing under the ESA, and
NMFS will identify the extent of this ESU during its current Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California steelhead
status review (59 FR 27527, May 27, 1994). Detailed information provided in the petition for Deer Creek steelhead
will be considered during this expanded status review.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS issues a proposed rule to clarify and make minor changes to regulations implementing the North Pacific Fisheries
Research Plan (Research Plan). The proposed rule would clarify 1995 observer coverage requirements, revise the
definition of the term ``processor,'' specify who is and is not included in the definition of processor, and exempt
certain processors included in the definition from the requirement to have a Federal Processor Permit. These clarifications
will be incorporated as minor revisions to the instructions accompanying the Federal Processor Permit Application.
In addition, the definition of ``round weight'' will be revised to conform it to recent regulatory changes. This proposed
rule is consistent with the intent of the final rule implementing the Research Plan and is intended to reduce confusion
during the first year of the fee-collection program authorized under the Research Plan. NMFS expects these changes
to be effective by January 1, 1995.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulations implementing the Research Plan became effective October 6, 1994 (59 FR 46126, September 6, 1994). A correction
subsequently was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that delayed specified parts of the implementing rule until January 1, 1995 (59 FR 51874, October 13, 1994). The purpose
for, and description of, the Research Plan are contained in the preamble to that final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS has identified five areas of ambiguity and inconsistency in the final rule implementing the Research Plan. Consequently,
the following changes are proposed: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The 1995 observer coverage requirements set out at &sect;677.10(a)(1)(i)(C) are clarified to continue to exempt
from observer coverage any vessel that delivers unsorted codends to a processor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The definition of ``processor'' under the Research Plan is amended to make clear NMFS' interpretation that tender
vessels are not considered processors for purposes of the Research Plan, and that fishermen who transfer fish to persons
outside of the United States are included in the definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The requirement for a Federal Processor Permit is also revised. Certain persons, although considered processors
under the definition of that term, are not required to obtain this permit. Fishermen who sell fish directly to a restaurant
or to another individual for use as bait or personal consumption or fishermen who transfer fish to a person outside
the United States are not required to have a processor permit.

Prior to the effective date of the Research Plan, Amendments 13 and 18 to the FMPs for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska
and Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area respectively, authorized the Observer Plan, which set
out domestic observer coverage requirements for groundfish vessels and processors. The Observer Plan stated ``
*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;operators of catcher vessels which transport unsorted codends to a mothership are not
required to comply with this Observer Plan.'' On April 29, 1994, a final rule was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to revise observer coverage requirements that inadvertently deleted this exemption for catcher vessels 125 ft (38.1
m) length overall (LOA) or longer (59 FR 22133). This erroneous regulatory language was incorporated into the final
rule implementing 1995 observer coverage requirements under the Research Plan (&sect;677.10(a)(1)(i)(C)). The
result is that current regulations under the Research Plan require catcher vessels 125 ft (38.1 m) LOA or longer to
carry an observer at all times, even when the vessel is delivering unsorted codends to a processor and no opportunity
exists for the observer to observe the catch. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule would revise regulations at &sect;677.10(a)(1)(i)(C) to correct this error by requiring a catcher
vessel 125 ft (38.1 m) LOA or longer to carry an observer 100 percent of its fishing days. The term ``fishing days'' currently
is defined at &sect;677.2 to exclude days during which a vessel only delivers unsorted codends to a processor.

Definition of the Term ``Processor'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The definition of the term ``processor,'' as published in the September 6, 1994, final rule implementing the Research
Plan, includes any person, except a restaurant, who receives fish from fishermen for commercial purposes. The final
rule implementing the Research Plan added the exclusion for restaurants, but indicated the intent was that all landings
of fish harvested in Research Plan fisheries be accounted for so that fees may be assessed based on the amount of fish
landed and an annually specified fee per pound. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the definition published in the September 6, 1994, final rule, a tender vessel receiving fish from fishermen
for delivery to a shoreside processing facility could be considered a processor. Inclusion of tender vessels as processors
for purposes of the Research Plan was not the intent of the final rule implementing the Research Plan and is unnecessary
to account for landings of fish. Accordingly, NMFS proposes to revise the definition of ``processor'' so that it is
clear that tender vessels are not included. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of processor in the September 6, 1994, final rule also inadvertently excluded fishermen who transport
fish to persons outside the United States. To date, the amount of fish transferred by fishermen to persons outside
the United States is believed to be small. However, the halibut and sablefish Individual Fishing Quota (IFQ) program
scheduled for implementation in 1995 (58 FR 59375, November 9, 1993) is anticipated to result in increased deliveries
of these species to persons in Canada and elsewhere outside the United States. Such deliveries could result in unreported
landings. Consequently, NMFS proposes to revise the definition of ``processor'' to clarify that these fishermen
are considered processors so that they are held accountable for payment of billed fee assessments.

Exemption of Certain Processors From Applying for a Processor Permit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule implementing the Research Plan requires that all processors of fish from Research Plan fisheries must
have a Federal Processor Permit. This requirement is reasonable for those processors that anticipate participation
in a Research Plan fishery, but is not necessary for a fisherman who delivers fish outside of the United States or sells
fish directly to restaurants or to individuals for use as bait or personal consumption. Furthermore, the fisherman
may not be the owner of the catcher vessel. Vessel owners often cannot anticipate the number or identity of operators
of their vessels during a given fishing year. As a result, individual fishermen who are processors under the Research
Plan may be difficult to identify until after an Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&amp;G) fish ticket or other
documentation of landing has been submitted. Therefore, this proposed rule would make it explicit that these processors
are exempt from such requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS further notes its intent that the following sections of the Observer Plan still are effective during the first
year of the Research Plan (1995): (1) Standards of observer conduct (attachment number 3); and (2) the description,
specifications, and work statement for certified domestic observer contractors, including conflict of interest
standards for NMFS-certified observers and contractors and conditions for contractor and observer certification
revocation (attachment number 4). Copies of the Observer Plan dated May 1994 are available from NMFS (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the first year of the Research Plan, standards and criteria for conduct, certification, conflict of interest,
and revocation of certification of observers and observer contractors will be included as part of the contractual
arrangements between NMFS and observer contractors.

This proposed rule includes minor revisions to the instructions accompanying the collection of information approved
by the Office of Management and Budget, OMB control number 0648&hyph;0206 (Processor Permit Application). No new
information is collected, but the number of persons required to comply with this collection-of-information requirement
is reduced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The North Pacific Fishery Management Council, NMFS, and the ADF&amp;G prepared a final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
as part of the Regulatory Impact Review prepared for the Research Plan. A copy of this analysis is available from the
Council (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS finds that this proposed action should be implemented as soon as possible so that clear instructions may be sent
out to the industry that reflect what will be in place for the 1995 fee collection program authorized under the Research
Plan. Delay in implementing the proposed revisions would create unnecessary confusion within the fishing industry
concerning implementation of the Research Plan during 1995. NMFS is providing a 15-day comment period to expedite
final action while allowing an opportunity for public comment.

This proposed rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866.
