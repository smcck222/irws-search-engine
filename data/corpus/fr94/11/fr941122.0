<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule amends Food Stamp Program regulations relative to food stamp redemption and changes the definition of ``insured
financial institution''. This change is necessary because of statutory revisions to the Federal bank insurance
system. Financial institutions formerly insured by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC)
are now insured by the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF), which is administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (FDIC). This rule also modifies the procedures for financial institutions which deposit food stamps
at Federal Reserve Banks in order to be consistent with changes in Federal Reserve requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, this rule amends 7 CFR chapter II to reflect the abolishment of the Food and Nutrition Service and the establishment
of the Food and Consumer Service in the recent Department of Agriculture reorganization.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have
preemptive effect with respect to any state or local laws, regulations or policies which conflict with its provisions
or which would otherwise impede its full implementation. This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect unless
so specified in the ``Effective Date'' paragraph of this preamble. Prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions
of this rule or the application of its provisions all applicable administrative procedures must be exhausted. In
the Food Stamp Program the administrative procedures are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For program benefit recipients_state administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2020 (e)(10) and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For State agencies_administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2023 set out at 7 CFR 276.7 (for rules
related to non-quality control (QC) liabilities) or part 284 (for rules related to QC liabilities); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For program retailers and wholesalers_administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2023 set out at
7 CFR 278.8.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current regulations at 7 CFR part 278 contain requirements that firms authorized by the Food and Consumer Service
to accept food stamps may redeem them only at financial institutions which are insured by the FDIC or the FSLIC; or at
financial institutions which are insured under the Federal Credit Union Act and which have retail food stores or wholesale
food concerns in their field of membership (7 CFR 278.5). On August 9, 1989, the FSLIC, along with its parent organization,
the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, ceased to exist. These institutions have been consolidated into the SAIF pursuant
to sections 211(6) and 401 of the Financial Institution Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) (Pub.
L. 101&hyph;73, 103 Stat. 183). The SAIF is administered by the FDIC. This rule amends the Food Stamp Program regulations
to delete FSLIC wherever that reference appears. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is also amending the regulations to be consistent with the Federal Reserve requirements that financial
institutions submit only balanced deposits to the Federal Reserve and use Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR)
to encode on the Food Stamp Redemption Certificate the verified amount of coupons received from authorized firms.
The redemption certificate is the deposit document that authorized firms use to deposit coupons with financial institutions
for credit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Deposit Balancing Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In an effort to improve the accountability in the food coupon redemption process and reduce the likelihood of fraud,
the Department enlisted the cooperation of the Federal Reserve to modify its depositing requirements for food coupons
to facilitate reconciliation of coupons deposited with deposit documents and redemption certificates. Financial
institutions are now required by the Federal Reserve to submit balanced deposits, which means that the face value
of coupons deposited must match both the amount of coupons entered on the financial institution's deposit document
and the total amount of coupons entered by authorized firms on the redemption certificates accompanying the deposit.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
MICR-Encoding Requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Requiring financial institutions, or retailers with MICR-encoding capability, to MICR-encode the verified coupon
amount on redemption certificates allows redemption data to be electronically captured at the Federal Reserve Banks
and transmitted directly to the Department's computer processing center. It also allows the Federal Reserve Banks
and the Department to achieve greater accuracy and accountability in the coupon deposit reconciliation system while
using standard banking technology. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A proposed rule dealing with these requirements was published at 56 FR 13,601 on April 3, 1991 and provided the public
with a 60-day period to submit comments on the proposed provisions. The Department received no public comments on
the proposed rule and this rule is being finalized without change.

Pursuant to Pub. L. 103&hyph;354, The Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Department of Agriculture Reorganization
Act of 1994, the Secretary of Agriculture issued Secretary's Memorandum 1010&hyph;1, Reorganization of the Department
of Agriculture, on October 20, 1994. SM 1010&hyph;1 orders the abolishment of the Food Nutrition Service (FNS), and
the establishment of the Food and Consumer Service, which assumes the functions previously performed by FNS. This
rule includes amendments to 7 CFR chapter II which are necessary to bring Agency regulations into alignment with the
Departmental reorganization.

The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, with appropriate changes, the provisions
of the interim final rule which authorized expenses and established an assessment rate for the Texas Valley Citrus
Committee (TVCC) under Marketing Order No. 906 for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year. Authorization of this budget enables
the TVCC to incur expenses that are reasonable and necessary to administer this program. Funds to administer this
program are derived from assessments on handlers.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 906 [7 CFR Part 906] regulating the handling of oranges
and grapefruit grown in the lower Rio Grande Valley in Texas. The agreement and order are effective under the Agricultural
Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing order provisions
now in effect, oranges and grapefruit grown in Texas are subject to assessments. It is intended that the assessment
rate specified herein will be applicable to all assessable citrus fruit handled during the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year,
beginning August 1, 1994, through July 31, 1995. This final rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations,
or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a
hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district
court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of
business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is
filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 135 handlers of oranges and grapefruit regulated under the marketing order each season and
approximately 2,500 orange and grapefruit producers in Texas. Small agricultural producers have been defined by
the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small
agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of these
handlers and producers may be classified as small entities.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Texas orange and grapefruit marketing order, administered by the Department, requires that the assessment rate
for a particular fiscal year apply to all assessable citrus fruit handled from the beginning of such year. Annual budgets
of expenses are prepared by the TVCC, the agency responsible for local administration of this marketing order, and
submitted to the Department for approval. The members of the TVCC are handlers and producers of Texas oranges and grapefruit.
They are familiar with the TVCC's needs and with the costs for goods, services, and personnel in their local area, and
are thus in a position to formulate appropriate budgets. The TVCC's budget is formulated and discussed in a public
meeting. Thus, all directly affected persons have an opportunity to participate and provide input. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The assessment rate recommended by the TVCC is derived by dividing the anticipated expenses by expected shipments
of oranges and grapefruit. Because that rate is applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate which
will provide sufficient income to pay the TVCC's expected expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The TVCC met on May 10, 1994, and unanimously recommended total expenses of $1,141,944 and an assessment rate of $0.16
per 7/10 bushel carton for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year. In comparison, the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal year expense amount
was $984,319, which is $157,625 less than the recommended $1,141,944 for this season and the assessment rate was $0.15,
which is $0.01 less than that recommended for the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessment income for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year is expected to amount to $960,000 based upon estimated fresh domestic
shipments of 6 million cartons of oranges and grapefruit. This, in addition to a withdrawal of $181,944 from the TVCC's
reserve fund, should be adequate to cover budgeted expenses. In comparison, the assessment income for the 1993&hyph;94
fiscal year was estimated at $825,000 based upon anticipated fresh domestic shipments of 5.5 million cartons of oranges
and grapefruit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Funds in the reserve at the end of the fiscal year, estimated at $276,468, will be within the maximum permitted by the
order of one fiscal year's expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Major expense categories for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year include $132,444 for shared administrative expenses
with the South Texas Onion and Melon Committees, $650,000 for advertising, compared to $723,425 for the 1993&hyph;94
fiscal year, and $174,000 for the Mexican Fruit Fly support program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The expenses and assessment rates were authorized by an interim final rule issued on July 28, 1994, and published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 [59 FR 39415, August 3, 1994]. A 30-day comment period was provided for interested persons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No comments were received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committed met again on June 30, 1994, and unanimously recommended to increase expenses from $1,141,944 to 1,153,944,
which is an increase of $12,000 from previously authorized amount. The increase is necessary for funding of one-third
of the cost of a Texas Citrus Tree Inventory Survey. No change was recommended to the assessment rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee met once again on October 11, 1994, unanimously recommended an additional increase in expenses of $7,300.
The Committee recommended this additional increase to fund a post harvest project. This will bring the total recommended
expenses for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year to $1,161,244. Once again no change in the assessment rate was recommended.
The additional funding needed for these increases will be taken from the Committee's reserve fund. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs should be significantly
offset by the benefits derived from the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS
has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is found that the specified expenses for the marketing orders covered in this rule are reasonable and likely to be
incurred and that such expenses and the specified assessment rates to cover such expenses will tend to effectuate
the declared policy of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is further found that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 [5 U.S.C. 553] because the Committees need to have sufficient funds to pay their expenses which are incurred on a continuous
basis. The 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year for the programs began on August 1, 1994. The marketing orders require that the
rates of assessment for the fiscal year apply to all assessable oranges and grapefruit handled during the fiscal year.
In addition, handlers are aware of this action which was recommended by the Committees at public meetings and published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule
on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified
that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule terminates
the remaining administrative provisions of the Memphis order.

The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), provides that administrative
proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler
subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any
obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with the law and requesting a modification of
an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After
a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in
any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity
to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the
date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This order of termination is issued pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act and of
the order regulating the handling of milk in the Memphis, Tennessee, marketing area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 27, 1993 (58 FR 25576), concerning a proposed termination of the remaining provisions of the order. Interested
persons were afforded opportunity to file written data, views and arguments thereon. Several comments were received.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant material, including the proposal in the notice, the comments received, and other
available information, it is hereby found and determined that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;1097.1 of the order does not tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Statement of Consideration
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule terminates the remaining administrative provisions of the Memphis, Tennessee, Federal milk order. A public
hearing that considered proposed amendments to all Federal milk orders was held in September, October, and November
1990, pursuant to notice thereof issued July 11, 1990 (55 FR 29034). Following the issuance of a recommended decision
and the opportunity for filing exceptions, the Acting Assistant Secretary for Marketing and Inspection Services
on February 5, 1993, issued a final decision on the issues considered at the hearing. In a referendum held following
the issuance of the final decision, the proposed amended Memphis order was not approved by at least two-thirds of the
order's producers who voted. The Act requires that an order, as amended, be approved by at least two-thirds of the producers
who voted in the referendum or by producers who, during the representative period, produced at least two-thirds of
the volume of milk marketed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the basis of the record of the public hearing, the comments received in response to the proposed termination of Order
97, and the results of the producer referendum, the Department issued a termination order, effective midnight July
31, 1993. The order terminated the monthly operating provisions of the Memphis, Tennessee, order, but left intact
certain administrative provisions that were embodied, by reference, in &sect;1097.1 of the order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The market administrator, in his capacity as the order's liquidating agent, has completed the disbursement of all
of the money remaining in the administrative, producer-settlement, and marketing service funds established under
the order. Hence, the remaining provisions of the order should be terminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the aforesaid provisions of &sect;1097.1 of the order are hereby terminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is hereby found and determined that thirty days' notice of the effective date hereof is impractical, unnecessary
and contrary to the public interest in that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The termination is necessary to reflect current marketing conditions and to assure orderly marketing conditions
in the marketing area; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) This termination does not require of persons affected substantial or extensive preparation prior to the effective
date; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Notice of proposed rulemaking was given interested parties and they were afforded opportunity to file written
data, views or arguments concerning this termination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, good cause exists for making this order effective upon publication in the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The reorganization of the Immigration and Naturalization Service was approved by Attorney General Reno on January
14, 1994. A copy of the organization chart, which graphically illustrates the approved structure, is published with
this final regulation as Appendix A.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The reorganization will: (a) Create a clearer sense of mission by knitting together the Service's major functions
and programs; (b) decentralize decision-making authority and delegate authority to persons geographically closer
to the locations where work is being performed; (c) empower field operational units to improve the delivery of services
to customers; (d) re-engineer major processes, such as those which develop and disseminate organizational policy
and guidelines, and which are outdated approaches to handing records and information; and (e) develop a capability
and commitment to plan for the future, set customer service standards, and establish quantitative performance measures
to enable the Service to evaluate its programs and service delivery. To accomplish these goals, the reorganization
creates several new components through the restructuring of some existing ones and the abolition of others. Some
components retain their identity, but with revised duties and reporting relationships, while other components
remain unchanged. This final regulation formalizes the new components, responsibilities, and reporting relationships.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The reorganization reaffirms the position of the Deputy Commissioner and specifically empowers the incumbent to
serve as Chief Operating Officer for the Service. The Deputy Commissioner supervises the four newly established
Executive Associate Commissioner (EAC) positions. The EACs are for Programs, Field Operations, Policy and Planning,
and Management. The EAC for Field Operations supervises the Regional Directors who, in turn, supervise the District
Directors and Chief Patrol Agents. The other three EACS are staff to the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner. The
responsibility for reconciling field and Headquarters requirements lies with the Deputy Commissioner, freeing
the Commissioner to set policy and represent the Service externally.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Executive Associate Commissioner for Field Operations responds to field office needs; implements policy; ensures
consistency and program effectiveness in the work of Service districts and sectors, including the Service's foreign
offices; and serves as a single point of contact and advocacy at the Headquarters level for field issues. The EAC for

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The reorganization abolishes the four Regional Commissioner positions and replaces them with three Regional Directors
for domestic activities. They are responsible for Eastern, Central, and Western Field Operations. These three domestic
regions replace the old four-region configuration and provide an intermediate management level between dispersed,
complex field activities and Headquarters. Each region includes a southern and a northern border. The regional alignment
reflects an even, three-way distribution of Service workload and resources. The Regional Directors will also act
as spokespersons in their respective geographic areas.

The reorganization creates an Office of International Affairs and places it under the Executive Associate Commissioner

asylum program. This action establishes the foreign districts as a mini-region, and allows them to function as an
extension of domestic operations, discharging refugee and parole responsibilities.

The Office of Plans and Analysis is renamed Policy and Planning and moved under the new EAC for Policy and Planning.
This organization serves as a clearinghouse for Service policy and is responsible for a wide spectrum of policy activities,
including policy formulation, codification, and dissemination within the agency. To this end, the Office of Policy
Directives and Instructions is absorbed by the new organization. Strategic planning, annual priorities development,

The Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (5 U.S.C. 605 (b)), has reviewed this regulation and, by approving it, certifies that the rule will not have a significant

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is considered by the Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service, to be a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866, section 3(f), Regulatory Planning and Review and has been approved
by the Office of Management and Budget. As noted in the supplementary section of the rule, the Service has realigned
functions and responsibilities to increase overall operational efficiency. The organizational realignments,
decentralization and redelegation of specific programmatic responsibility and accountability, as well as empowerment
of staff, are critical changes being implemented by the reorganization. These initiatives are deemed by the Service
to be significant actions which are in conformance with the Administration's priorities as outlined by the National
Performance Review.

This regulation will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the National

Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism
implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the animal drug regulations to clarify approval of a supplemental
new animal drug application (NADA) 140&hyph;989 filed by Western Chemical, Inc. This action is being taken to reflect
that only Western Chemical, Inc., has approval for the use of formalin to treat shrimp infected with external parasites.

 In the

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 8, 1993 (58 FR 59168), FDA published a document reflecting approval of a supplement to NADA 140&hyph;989
filed by Western Chemical, Inc. The supplement provides for use of formalin solution (aqueous solution of 37 percent
formaldehyde) in tanks, raceways, and ponds to control the external penaeid shrimp protozoa

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Zoothamnium
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 spp. The regulations amended 21 CFR 529.1030 to reflect that approval. Although the preamble to the November 8, 1993,
final rule specifically limited approval of Formalin for this use, the regulations did not specifically limit approval
to Western Chemical, Inc. Because Western Chemical, Inc., is the only firm that has an approved supplemental NADA
for this use, this document corrects that amendment.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This document amends the Department of Veterans Affairs regulations relating to Service-Disabled Veterans' Insurance
(S&hyph;DVI) prefixed ``RH'' (pertaining to life insurance acquired by veterans with service-connected disabilities)
and ``ARH'' (pertaining to gratuitous life insurance benefits provided to veterans with service-connected disabilities
who are not competent to apply for such insurance) to reflect that the statute regarding such insurance has been amended
by the Veterans' Benefits Programs Improvement Act of 1991 to provide for a two-year eligibility period and to provide
that ARH gratuitous insurance benefits must be paid in one lump sum. These amendments are necessary to conform the
regulations to statutory provisions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 201(b) of the ``Veterans' Benefits Programs Improvement Act of 1991,'' Public Law 102&hyph;86, in part,
amended 38 U.S.C. 1922 to increase the S&hyph;DVI eligibility period from one year to two years for veterans found
to be eligible for S&hyph;DVI on or after September 1, 1991. Section 202 of Public Law 102&hyph;86 amended 38 U.S.C.
1922 to provide that S&hyph;DVI ``ARH'' benefits must be paid in one lump sum. VA, accordingly, hereby amends 38 CFR
8.0 and 8.116 to reflect these statutory changes. VA has determined that prior publication for notice and public comment
is unnecessary since the amendments merely reflect statutory changes and are not subject to rule-making requirements.

(iii) Written application for such insurance must be submitted within two years from the date service connection
for any disability as determined by the Department of Veterans Affairs is established based on the promulgation of
a rating subsequent to discharge. If it is shown by satisfactory evidence that the applicant was mentally incompetent
during any part of the two-year period, application may be filed within two years after a guardian is appointed or within
two years after the removal of such mental incompetency, whichever is the earlier date. If service connection for
a disability is based on a rating promulgated prior to September 1, 1991, then the written application must be submitted
within one year of the date the rating establishing service connection for the disability was promulgated.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Title IV of the Clean Air Act, as amended by Public Law 101-549, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (the Act), authorizes
the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) to establish the Acid Rain Program. On January 11, 1993, the Agency
promulgated final rules under title IV. Several parties filed petitions for review of the rules. On November 18, 1993,
the Agency published a notice of proposed revisions of those rules implementing sections 404(b) and (c) (substitution
plans) and 408(c)(1)(B) (reduced utilization plans) of the Act. On May 4, 1994, EPA and other parties signed a settlement
agreement addressing substitution and reduced utilization issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After reviewing the record, EPA concludes that the January 11, 1993 rules can be read to give utilities an ability to
use substitution and reduced utilization plans to create excess, new allowances. These allowances will authorize
sulfur dioxide emissions in excess of total emissions without the plans and will result from emission reductions
made, or required by federal or State law adopted, before enactment of title IV. This creation of allowances is contrary
to the purposes of sections 404(b) and (c) and 408(c)(1)(B) and can compromise achievement of the emissions reductions
intended under title IV. Consequently, EPA is modifying sections of part 72 of the January 11, 1993 regulations. The
rule revisions will prevent the use of substitution and reduced utilization plans to create excess, new allowances
and are consistent with the May 4, 1994 settlement.

The provisions in sections 404(b) and (c) and 408(c)(1)(B) of the Act concerning substitution and reduced utilization
plans have specific statutory purposes related to the achievement of the sulfur dioxide emissions reduction goals
of title IV. The Agency maintains that Congress did not intend that these provisions provide utilities an ability
to create excess, new allowances by bringing Phase II units into Phase I. Because the January 11, 1993 regulations
implementing these provisions can be read to allow the creation of excess, new allowances in Phase I, the Agency is
revising today the regulations to ensure that this does not occur.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed in the preamble of the November 18, 1993 proposal (58 FR 60950&hyph;60951), Congress established substitution
plans as a compliance option to increase units' compliance flexibility and reduce their overall costs of compliance
in Phase I while still achieving the emissions reductions intended by Congress under title IV. A substitution plan
allows the owner or operator of a unit listed in Table A of section 404 to reassign the unit's emissions reduction obligations
to a designated non-Table A unit under the owner's or operator's control. Upon approval of the reassignment, the non-Table
A unit becomes subject to all requirements for Phase I units with regard to sulfur dioxide and is allocated allowances.
Emissions reductions by the non-Table A unit may therefore free up allowances, which may be used by the Table A unit
(or any other unit) in lieu of making emissions reductions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 404(b)(5) of the Act expressly states that, with a substitution plan, the intended emissions reductions
must still be achieved. That section requires that, in approving a substitution plan, the Administrator ensure that
the substitution results in total emissions reductions at least equal to the total reductions that otherwise ``would
have been achieved'' by these Table A and non-Table A units ``without such substitution.'' 42 U.S.C. 7651c(b)(5).
EPA concludes that the substitution provision is intended to provide an alternative means of achieving Phase I reductions,
not a mechanism for avoiding such emission reductions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provision for reduced utilization plans has a statutory purpose that is also aimed at ensuring realization of
emission reductions. As explained in the November 18, 1993 preamble (58 FR 60951), Congress recognized that the potential
for circumvention of emission limitation requirements exists because in Phase I only a minority of all utility units
are subject to such requirements. A Phase I unit could simply reduce its utilization by shifting its generation, and
the emissions that would otherwise result, to a unit that was not required to use allowances to cover its emissions.
Allowances allocated to the Phase I unit would be freed up for use without achievement, at either unit, of the intended
emissions reductions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In section 408(c)(1)(B), Congress adopted a solution to this problem. Owners and operators of any Phase I unit that,
for compliance purposes, propose reducing utilization of the unit below 1985-87 utilization (i.e., its baseline)
in order to comply with title IV are required to submit a reduced utilization plan. In such a plan, the owners and operators
must designate the units that will provide generation to compensate for the reduced utilization of the Phase I unit
or must account for the reduced utilization through energy conservation or improved unit efficiency. 42 U.S.C. 7651(c)(1)(B).
Each compensating unit in an approved plan becomes subject to Phase I sulfur dioxide emissions limitations and is
allocated allowances equal to that unit's baseline times the lesser of the 1985 actual or allowable emissions rate
for the unit. The compensating unit will therefore have to use allowances to account for its emissions, including
any increased emissions resulting from compensating generation that it provides for the Phase I unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administrator approves or disapproves each plan (and compensating units proposed therein) after determining
whether the plan meets the requirements of title IV, including achievement of the intended emissions reductions
under the Acid Rain Program. 42 U.S.C. 7651g(c)(2); 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see also 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
58 FR 60951. Thus, like the provisions for substitution plans, the provisions for designating compensating units
in reduced utilization plans are intended to allow compliance flexibility but also to protect the emission reduction
goals of title IV by requiring that plans not result in more emissions than would occur without the plans. In fact, if
the reduced utilization plan provisions were interpreted to allow the creation of excess, new allowances, utilities
could simply use such plans to circumvent the limitation on the creation of allowances under substitution plans by
bringing the same Phase II units into Phase I as compensating units rather than substitution units.

flexibility and potential cost savings resulting from use of the allowance market.

II. Need to Modify the January 11, 1993 Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. The January 11, 1993 Regulations can be Read to Give Utilities the Ability to Bring Phase II Units Into Phase I and
Create Excess, New Allowances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 11, 1993, EPA promulgated regulations that implemented the major provisions of title IV, including the
substitution and reduced utilization provisions. As discussed in the November 18, 1993 preamble (58 FR 60951&hyph;60953),
these provisions can be read to provide utilities two alternative methods of bringing into Phase I, with few limitations,
selected Phase II units and creating excess, new allowances. The Agency concludes that both provisions must be revised
in order to eliminate this problem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under &sect;72.41 of the January 11, 1993 regulations, the designated representative for a unit on Table A may include
in the Phase I permit application a substitution plan designating, as substitution units, one or more existing units
that are Phase II units and so not on Table A. 40 CFR 72.41(b) (1993). There is no express requirement that the substitution
unit make reductions beyond those that it would have made without the plan or actually provide allowances for the Table
A unit and no express limit on the number of substitution units that a Table A unit may designate. Further, for the most
part, the decision whether to designate a particular Phase II unit as a substitution unit is at the discretion of the
utility. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 58 FR 60952. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 72.43 of the January 11, 1993 regulations requires, under certain circumstances, that the designated representative
for a Phase I unit submit a reduced utilization plan designating a compensating unit. Such a plan must be submitted
if the owners and operators of the unit plan to reduce utilization of the unit below its baseline for purposes of complying
with Phase I emissions limitations and to accomplish this by shifting generation to a non-Phase I unit. 40 CFR 72.43(b)
(1993). Because of concern that utilities would be unable to designate compensating units and therefore might engage
in uneconomic dispatching to avoid reduced utilization requiring such designations, the regulation establishes
broad exceptions to the requirement to submit a plan. 40 CFR 72.43(e) (1993); 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see also 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
58 FR 60958&hyph;60959. There is no express requirement that the Phase I unit actually have any reduced utilization
or the compensating unit actually provide any compensating generation to the Phase I unit. There is also no express
limit on the number of compensating units that a Phase I unit may designate and no express bar on a compensating unit
itself designating a compensating unit. Further, as with substitution units, a utility's decision to designate
a compensating unit is largely discretionary. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
58 FR 60952. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because utilities generally have broad discretion and flexibility in designating substitution and compensating
units, such units will likely be designated only if early entry into Phase I is beneficial, e.g., where early entry
creates new allowances because the units have lower actual emissions in Phase I than the allowances they will receive
as substitution or compensating units. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
58 FR 60953 and n. 2. Before the enactment of title IV, some Phase II units had reduced emissions rates for economic or
other reasons and some States had already adopted laws requiring their utilities to reduce emissions rates prior
to Phase II. Such reductions occurred, or will occur, for reasons independent of the substitution and reduced utilization
provisions. Under the January 11, 1993 regulations, for each Phase I year that a substitution or reduced utilization
plan is in effect, each substitution or compensating unit under the plan is allocated a number of allowances equal
to the unit's baseline times the lesser of the 1985 actual or allowable emissions rate for the unit. 40 CFR 72.41(c)(3)
and (d) and 72.43(c)(4)(ii) and (d) (1993). Consequently, some Phase II units may enter Phase I as substitution or
compensating units and convert emission rate reductions into excess, new allowances: i.e., allowances that would
not otherwise be available and that reflect emission rate reductions that would occur even without plans allowing
early entry into Phase I. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The excess, new allowances may become available to affected units in Phase I and/or in Phase II and enable such units
to avoid making emissions reductions that title IV would otherwise require them to make. These allowances may thereby
diminish the emissions reductions that Congress intended to be achieved by virtue of title IV. In sum, as explained
in the November 18, 1993 preamble, the January 11, 1993 regulations transform the statutory substitution and reduced
utilization provisions from provisions for facilitating and protecting anticipated emissions reductions under
title IV into potential means of creating excess, new allowances that can be used to avoid such reductions. (58 FR 60953.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the regulations provide alternative means (through substitution plans or reduced utilization plans) of
creating excess, new allowances, the regulations are contrary to Congressional intent and sections 404(b) and (c)
and 408(c)(1)(B) of the Act and therefore must be modified to eliminate both alternatives.

B. Under the January 11, 1993 Regulations, Entry of Phase II Units Into Phase I can Significantly Compromise the Emissions
Reduction Goals of Title IV 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The potential number of excess, new allowances created by substitution and compensating units under the January
11, 1993 regulations may be sufficient to compromise significantly the achievement of the emissions reductions
intended by Congress under title IV. The Agency estimates that entry into Phase I of Phase II units that will benefit
from becoming substitution or compensating units and that reduced emissions rates between 1985 and 1991 for economic
or other reasons or were required by federal or State law as of November 15, 1990 to reduce emissions rates between 1985
and 1995 will create about 200,000 allowances per year in Phase I in excess of emissions without such entry.

Thus, the current substitution and reduced utilization provisions will potentially result in the creation of excess,
new allowances authorizing additional emissions of 1,000,000 tons of sulfur dioxide in all of Phase I.

This is a conservative estimate of the potential for creation of excess, new allowances. Assuming that all 250 designated
substitution and compensating units in existing permit applications are activated as substitution units for all
of Phase I, about 385,000 excess, new allowances will be created per year under the January 11, 1993 regulations. Assuming
all existing Phase II units (about 2,000 units) will become substitution units for all of Phase I, almost 1,000,000
excess, new allowances will be created per year in Phase I under the January 11, 1993 regulations.

regulations.

 EPA estimates that the expected reductions by Phase I units alone during Phase I are about 2.4 million tons in 1995 and
1996 and about 3.5 million tons in 1997, 1998, and 1999. Memorandum from T. Larry Montgomery to Brian J. McLean (Oct.
15, 1993). As discussed above, the statutory language and legislative history demonstrate that Congress did not
intend these reductions to be eroded by substitution or reduced utilization plans. Yet, under the current regulations,
Phase I units can avoid some of these reductions by offsetting their emissions in Phase I with excess, new allowances
resulting from such plans. The use of 200,000 excess, new allowances per year in Phase I will negate a significant portion
(i.e., 6 to 8 percent) of estimated, expected reductions for Phase I units.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
uncertainty over what emissions decreases or increases would occur at Phase II units that would not be subject to emissions
limitations until Phase II. Because of the lack of emissions limitations on such units in Phase I, the Phase I emissions
of these units and the impact on total Phase I reductions could only be projected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternatively, banking these new allowances for use in Phase II will diminish the intended emissions reduction impact
of the 8.95 million ton cap established by Congress for Phase II.

 See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 58 FR 60954&hyph;60955 (explaining the importance of the Phase II cap). The carryover and use of the excess, new allowances
created by early entry of Phase II units into Phase I can result in emissions exceeding the cap for each of the first five
years of Phase II by as much as 200,000 tons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The magnitude of potential erosion of expected emissions reductions supports the Agency's conclusion, based on
statutory language and legislative history, that Congress did not intend to allow substitution or compensating
units to create allowances for pre-Phase II emissions reductions that would have been achieved in the absence of substitution
and reduced utilization plans.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Agency's conclusion is also supported by Congress' approach in sections 404(e), 405, and 410 of the Act. As discussed
in the November 18, 1993 preamble (58 FR 60954), the fact that in those sections Congress carefully limited the ability
of Phase II units to obtain additional allowances for pre-Phase II reductions strongly suggests that sections 404(b)
and (c) and 408(c)(1(B) should not be interpreted to allow allowance allocations for all such reductions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Thus, contrary to the assertion of some commenters, the Agency's modification of the current regulations is not based
on circular reasoning. The statutory language and legislative history demonstrate that Congress did not intend
for substitution or reduced utilization plans to result in fewer reductions than without the plans. The analysis
that such plans under the January 11, 1993 regulations can result in about 200,000 excess, new allowances per year
in Phase I shows the potential magnitude of the problem and supports today's modification of the regulations to ensure
consistency with the statute.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions rate for Phase I as of November 15, 1990, the date of enactment of title IV of the Act. In addition, the final
regulations eliminate the language in the January 11, 1993 regulations providing that a Phase II unit that lacks any
common owner or operator but has a common designated representative with a Phase I unit can, without anything more,
be designated as a substitution unit.

1. Limiting the Allowances Allocated to Each Substitution Unit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule limits the number of allowances allocated to each substitution unit by calculating the allocation
using the lesser of the unit's 1985 SO

 emissions rate that is reasonably representative of what would have been achieved without the substitution plan.
Specifically, a substitution unit will be allocated allowances equal to baseline times the lesser of: the unit's
1985 actual SO

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions rate as of November 15, 1990 applicable to the unit in 1995&hyph;99. The January 11, 1993 regulations consider
only the unit's 1985 actual or allowable SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, section 404(b)(5) requires that the substitution plan include a demonstration that the ``reassigned
tonnage limits [under the plan] will, in total, achieve the same or greater emissions reduction than would have been
achieved by the original affected unit and the substitute unit or units without such substitution.'' 42 U.S.C. 7651c(b)(5).
The Agency interprets this provision to require that the plan achieve total reductions equal to or greater than both
(i) the Table A unit's reduction obligation in Phase I and (ii) the reductions that the substitution unit would have
made if it had not entered Phase I, including reductions made, or mandated by federal or State law adopted, prior to
the passage of title IV. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The preamble of the January 11, 1993 regulations sets forth a different interpretation of section 404(b)(5) that
the Agency concludes is erroneous. As EPA explained in the November 18, 1993 preamble (58 FR 60954&hyph;60955):
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the January 11, 1993 preamble, the Agency stated that any reductions in emissions rate that have been, or will be,
made at the substitution unit after 1985 without the substitution plan (e.g., reductions for economic reasons or
required by federal or State law) ``will not have resulted from title IV'' and so should ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
be counted as reductions that would have occurred without the plan.'' 58 FR 3601 (emphasis added). The difficulty
with this interpretation is that it appears to read out of section 404(b)(5) the requirement to ensure that a substitution
plan does not negate reductions ``that would have been achieved by *&blank;*&blank;* the substitute unit *&blank;*&blank;*
without such substitution.'' 42 U.S.C. 7651c(b)(5). In the absence of the plan, the substitution unit would not be
subject to title IV until Phase II. If only reductions required by title IV were considered under section 404(b)(5),
the amount of reductions that would have been achieved by the substitution unit without the plan (i.e., the reductions
in Phase I) would always be zero *&blank;*&blank;*. The reference to such reductions would therefore be meaningless.
In interpreting the Act, it should not be presumed that Congress adopted meaningless language. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters on the November 18, 1993 proposal suggested a third interpretation of section 404(b)(5). They claimed
that the provision addresses only situations where, as part of the substitution plan, allowances that would be allocated
to the substitution unit are instead allocated by EPA to the Table A unit. Specifically, the commenters alleged that
the terms ``reassigned tonnage limits'' and ``such substitution'' in section 404(b)(5) are synonymous and refer
only to the ``allocation of a number of allowances to the Table A unit in addition to those that the Table A unit would
otherwise receive.'' Comments of UARG at 33 n. 54 and 34. Accordingly, it is argued that section 404(b)(5) requires
only that the number of additional allowances that are allocated under the plan to the Table A unit cannot be greater
than the number of allowances that are subtracted from the allocation that the substitution unit would otherwise
receive under the plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency rejects this interpretation, which is inconsistent with the substitution plans that the commenters themselves
have submitted to the Agency and which would reduce section 404(b)(5) to a triviality. As the commenters noted, section
404(b) describes a substitution plan as ``a proposal to reassign, in whole or in part, the affected [Table A] unit's
sulfur dioxide reduction requirements to any other unit(s)'' under the control of the owner or operator of the Table
A unit. 42 U.S.C. 7651c(b) and Comments of UARG at 33. According to the commenters, such reassignment occurs only where
allowances otherwise allocated to a substitution unit are instead allocated to the Table A unit. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
at 34 and 40&hyph;1. This is allegedly the only circumstance to which section 404(b)(5) would apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the commenters' interpretation were correct, then only those plans that actually provide for such an additional
allocation of allowances to the Table A unit would be substitution plans, as defined by section 404(b). However, although
&sect;72.41(c)(4)(ii) of the January 11, 1993 regulations provides the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
option
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to redistribute allowance allocations in this way, such redistribution is not required by &sect;72.41. Moreover,
EPA has not received a single substitution plan for any units that includes such a redistribution of allowance allocations.

of allowances from a substitution unit to a Table A unit). Under the commenters' approach, none of the substitution
plans submitted to date are ``proposals to reassign *&blank;*&blank;* reduction requirements'' under section
404(b). Further, the commenters' interpretation of section 404(b)(5) would reduce that provision to a trivial requirement
that EPA cannot give more additional allowances to the Table A unit than it takes from the substitution unit.

When section 404(b)(5) is properly interpreted, these problems evaporate. The term ``reassigned tonnage limits''
refers to the total allowance allocations made, in every substitution plan, to the Table A and substitution units
under the plan and not simply to redistributed allowances. Thus, section 404(b)(5) requires that each substitution
plan must result in ``the same or greater'' reductions of sulfur dioxide emissions as would have been made by the Table
A and substitution units without a substitution plan.

emissions reductions that would be achieved by the Table A unit, and not those by the substitution unit, in the absence
of the plan. Such reliance is misplaced because section 404(b)(5) explicitly requires that the emissions reductions

The Agency concludes that section 404(b)(5) must be interpreted to take into account, and avoid allocating allowances
to the substitution unit for, reductions that would otherwise have been made at the substitution unit since 1985 in
the absence of a substitution plan. The Agency maintains that there are two categories of reductions that would otherwise
have been made and that therefore should be excluded from the allocation of allowances to substitution units: (1)
emissions rate reductions that were made voluntarily, for economic or other reasons, by a substitution unit after
1985 and before enactment of title IV; and (2) emissions rate reductions by a substitution unit between 1985 and 2000
that were mandated by federal or State law as of the enactment of title IV.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With regard to the first category of emissions reductions, EPA is modifying the January 11, 1993 regulations to provide
that substitution units will not be allocated allowances for voluntary emissions rate reductions made before enactment
of title IV: i.e., reductions before title IV's enactment that were not mandated by federal or State law and that were
made for economic or other reasons. To the extent a unit's emissions rate reductions are caused by economic or other
factors that would have existed in Phase I even if the unit did not become a substitution unit, such reductions would
have occurred without a substitution plan and therefore must be taken into account under section 404(b)(5) and excluded
from allowance allocations. In theory, any reductions made by a unit between 1985 and 1999 could potentially be in
response to such factors and, if so, could be considered as reductions that would have occurred without the substitution
plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency maintains that there must be a bright line drawn to determine whether a unit's voluntary reductions in emissions
rate would occur even if the unit were not a substitution unit. It would be difficult to make accurate case-by-case
determinations, concerning a large number of units, as to whether the owners and operator of a particular unit took
actions after 1985 to reduce its emissions rate in anticipation of the unit becoming a substitution unit. Such determinations
would require analyzing economic and other factors that may be involved (e.g., fuel costs, the timing for retrofitting
of pollution controls, and the regulatory benefits and risks of becoming a substitution unit), balancing the factors
favoring or disfavoring action to reduce the emissions rate, and judging what the owners and operator would have done
in the past concerning the unit's emissions in the absence of substitution plans.

might have to be adjusted, each time the owners and operators of the unit take actions after approval of the substitution
plan that reduce the unit's emissions rate in Phase I.

The Agency concludes that the best approach to developing a reasonable approximation of what a unit's emissions rate
would be in Phase I in the absence of a substitution plan is to treat all voluntary emissions rate reductions after 1985
and through 1990 (the year in which title IV of the Act was passed) as reductions that would have occurred in Phase I in
the absence of a substitution plan. Prior to enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, utilities had no reasonable
expectation that emissions reductions would generate nationally tradable allowances under the Act. The reductions
were not made in response to the availability of allowances under substitution plans. December 31, 1990 (rather than
November 15, 1990, the specific date of title IV's enactment) is used as the cut-off point for determining what reductions
that would have occurred without the plan because emissions rate data is available on a calendar year basis. Even though
some reductions after 1990 perhaps would have occurred without the plan, it would be difficult to sort out, for a large
number of units, the impact of the availability of substitution plans for the period after the substitution provision
was enacted.

 emissions rate will be treated as representative of reductions that would continue to be made up through 1999. In the
November 18, 1993 proposal, the Agency proposed to use the 1990 actual SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions rate as the measure of emissions reductions made before passage of title IV. The 1990 rate was proposed because,
as the emissions rate closest to November 15, 1990, it is more likely to reflect all the reductions made prior to passage
of title IV. The rate for an earlier year is less likely to reflect all reductions made before passage of title IV. However,
several commenters expressed concern that a unit's emissions rate for a single year (i.e., 1990) might be unusually
low and therefore unrepresentative of its emissions rate prior to the passage of title IV. These commenters suggested
that, if post-1985 emissions rates are used, the Agency should use a formula that allows consideration of actual emissions
rates for 1988, 1989, and 1990.

 Comments of Utility Air Regulatory Group at 45 (submitted Feb. 10, 1994); Comments of Northern States Power Company

rate because of normal variability in the sulfur content of coal or in scrubber performance. They suggested a case-by-case
determination of whether such variability accounts for the lower 1990 emissions rate.

 emissions rate to reflect pre-title IV emissions rate reductions. A unit's 1989 or 1990 emissions rate (which are
the most recent, actual rates prior to the enactment of title IV) will be treated as representative of its emissions
rate in Phase I in the absence of a substitution plan. This provides some flexibility to avoid using a single and perhaps
unrepresentative year. All voluntary emissions rate reductions made after 1990 will be treated as reductions that
would not otherwise have occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters opposed the use of any post-1985 actual emissions rate in limiting allowance allocations to substitution
units. Commenters argued the use of the 1990 actual emissions rate is arbitrary. Allegedly, this approach is arbitrary
because it assumes that emissions-reducing actions that were taken before 1991 for economic reasons will not necessarily
continue to be taken after passage of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, which changed the economics of such actions.
Commenters stated that utilities might redirect low sulfur coal from the potential substitution unit to another
unit and burn higher sulfur coal at the former unit. They also suggested that when the lower sulfur coal contract expires,
the utility might contract for higher sulfur coal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are several problems with these commenters' arguments. A reduction in a unit's 1989 or 1990 emissions rate from
1985 could be the result of several types of actions, including the addition of pollution control equipment or the
use of low sulfur coal. To the extent that the reduction reflects a capital investment in pollution control equipment,
it is reasonable to assume that the equipment will probably remain in place and continue to be used. Even where the reductions
were achieved through the use of low sulfur coal, the use of such coal or switching to high sulfur coal requires, in many
cases, capital investment in new equipment. This reduces the likelihood that emissions reductions made before enactment
of title IV would be reversed after passage of title IV. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, in section 404(b)(5), Congress required EPA to ensure that the reductions achieved under each substitution
plan be ``the same or greater than'' the reductions that would otherwise be achieved without the substitution plan.
42 U.S.C. 7651c. Because of the paramount importance apparently placed on the goal of achieving intended emissions
reductions, Congress required the Agency to adopt an approach that would ensure no fewer reductions with substitution
plans than without such plans but that could result in more reductions with than without the plans. In light of this
statutory requirement and the difficulty of determining what reductions would have been made without substitution
plans, the Agency concludes that the 1989 or 1990 actual emissions rate is a reasonable proxy for a unit's Phase I emissions
rate without the substitution plan. To the extent that the Agency's approach of using 1989 or 1990 emissions rate overstates
the reductions that would be achieved without the plan, the approach errs in a direction that ensures achievement
of the paramount statutory objective and is consistent with section 404(b)(5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In contrast, commenters' preferred alternative_using only 1985 actual or allowable emissions rates_would guarantee,
in some cases, violation of the statutory objective of no fewer reductions with, than without, the plan. One particularly
graphic example of that result is where a Phase II unit is voluntarily and permanently shutdown between 1985 and 1991
and is brought into Phase I as a substitution unit. Without a substitution plan, the unit would emit no sulfur dioxide
and receive no allowances in Phase I. With the plan, the unit would still have no emissions but would be allocated a significant
number of new allowances reflecting its 1985 emissions and other units could use the newly created allowances to authorize
emissions that would not otherwise have been allowed.

58 FR 38375 (noticing permit application with plan designating, as substitution units, Poston units 1, 2, and 3, which
were permanently shut down in 1987). The Agency's use of the most recent actual emissions rates prior to passage of
title IV is a reasonable approach to achieving the purposes of section 404(b)(5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters also argued that the Agency's approach penalizes those utilities that were ``environmentally *&blank;*&blank;*
progressive'' and will discourage voluntary emissions reductions in the future. Comments of the Class of '85 Regulatory
Response Group at 8 (submitted Feb. 10, 1994). However, each utility that made emissions reductions at Phase II units
after 1985 and before the date (January 1, 2000) such reductions are required under title IV already benefits in Phase
II of the Acid Rain Program, during which the units are allocated allowances reflecting in part the 1985 emissions
rate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments of Northern States Power Company at 3 (noting that allocations to most of the utility's units in Phase I and
Phase II exceed 1990 emissions levels). The issue here is whether, if such a utility elects to bring selected Phase
II units into Phase I, the utility should receive additional benefit (in the form of extra allowances for pre-title
IV reductions) that violates section 404(b)(5) of the Act. The Agency believes that the approach in the final rule
is a reasonable implementation of section 404(b)(5).

 emissions limitation imposed in Phase I by federal or State law, as of November 15, 1990. By definition, emissions
rate reductions that were mandated prior to title IV's enactment and that are required regardless of whether the unit
is a substitution unit are reductions that would have occurred in the absence of the plan.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency recognizes the difficulty of determining whether any particular federal or State emissions reduction
requirement (whether a tightening or a loosening of emissions limitations), adopted after title IV's enactment,
would have been adopted in the absence of substitution plans under title IV.

 This is similar to the problem of determining whether voluntary emissions rate reductions after 1990 would have been
made without a substitution plan, except that, with regard to federal or State emissions limitations, political
factors favoring or disfavoring imposition of the limitations would have to be weighed. Consequently, the Agency
maintains that a bright line, based on title IV's date of enactment, should be established and that emissions rate
reductions that were mandated by federal or State law adopted after November 15, 1990 should not be treated as reductions
that would otherwise have occurred. As explained in the preamble of the November 18, 1993 proposal (58 FR 60956), the
most stringent allowable rate for purposes of substitution-unit allowance allocations will be the most stringent
rate as of November 15, 1990 after conversion to pounds per mmBtu but without any annualization.

In contrast, State emissions limitations adopted prior to passage of title IV do not raise the same question about
whether they would have been adopted in the absence of title IV. Such emissions limitations, e.g., the Massachusetts
acid rain law passed in 1985, were in fact adopted in the absence of any federal acid rain program. The Massachusetts
statute included a provision stating that the Massachusetts legislature intended that reductions made under that
statute be credited to Massachusetts' share of required reductions if a federal acid rain program was established
in the future. Massachusetts, Acts of 1985, Chap. 590 &sect;9. Some commenters challenged, as contrary to the intent
of the Massachusetts law, the use of the Massachusetts emissions limitations to limit allowance allocations under
title IV. However, Congressional intent, not the intent of the Massachusetts legislature, is relevant to interpreting
title IV.

Some commenters argued that the Agency should distinguish between federal emissions limitations and State emissions
limitations and consider only federal limitations in allocating allowances to substitution units. They alleged
that it is unfair to ``penalize'' utilities in States ``tak[ing] the lead in controlling air emissions'' and that
title IV references federal, but not State, emissions limitations. Comments of Dairyland Power Cooperative at 2
(submitted Jan. 26, 1994). However, section 404(b)(5) requires that emissions reductions with the substitution
plan be no less than reductions without the plan and does not distinguish between reductions without the plan that
are due to State law from those due to federal law. Thus, contrary to the commenters, there is no basis for considering
only federal, and ignoring State, emissions limitations in applying section 404(b)(5). Further, the Agency reiterates
that:

[S]ince reliance on substitution plans is optional and the use of the most stringent allowable rate (in conjunction
with the 1985 actual or allowable rate and the [1989 or] 1990 actual rate) to allocate allowances under such plans is
necessary to meet statutory emissions reduction goals, it is difficult to see how such use of the most stringent allowable
rate could be viewed as unfair to utilities located in States that mandated reductions. This approach simply prevents
the creation of excess, new allowances and thereby ensures that reductions mandated by such States are not used to
increase emissions elsewhere above the levels that title IV was intended to achieve.

Using federal or State emissions limitations to limit a particular substitution unit's allowance allocation raises
certain questions, particularly where some emissions limitations are not unit specific. For example, under some
State laws (e.g., the acid rain laws for Massachusetts and Wisconsin), a utility has a maximum average emissions rate
for its units in the State. Under other State laws (e.g., for New Hampshire and Minnesota), a utility has a total tonnage
emissions cap for all its units in the State. Maximum average emissions rates or maximum total tonnage limits allow
utilities the flexibility to exceed such maximum rates or limits at individual units so long as the maximum rates or
limits are met on a utility-wide basis. Since individual units may exceed such maximum rates or limits, the Agency
concludes that it should not treat the maximum rates or limits as the most stringent limitation for each individual
unit. However, while utility-wide limitations provide some flexibility, such limitations impose bounds on the
emissions of individual units, albeit bounds that depend on the emissions from other units owned or operated by the
same utility. There is no basis for ignoring the fact that a unit may have to make emissions reductions because of a utility-wide
limitation, just as it may have to reduce emissions because of a unit-specific limitation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, the final revised rule provides that the Agency will develop a method for using both the unit-specific
and non-unit-specific emissions limitations to limit the allocation of allowances to a substitution unit. This
method will not treat non-unit-specific limitations as if they were unit specific and will not allow allocation of
allowances for reductions that were necessary to meet non-unit-specific limitations. Because there are significant
differences among State laws and the manner in which they express non-unit-specific emissions limitations, the
final revised rule gives the Agency the authority to develop this method on a case-by-case basis for each proposed
substitution unit. This approach will give the Agency the flexibility to take account of variations among States
and will allow interested parties an opportunity, e.g., in proceedings on individual permits, to comment on the method
that the Agency proposes to use with regard to a particular non-unit-specific limitation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters made specific recommendations concerning the method that EPA should use to apply the unit-specific
limitations under Wisconsin's acid rain law. Under the Wisconsin law, each major utility that generates electricity
in the State must achieve an annual average sulfur dioxide emissions rate that does not exceed 1.2 lbs per mmBtu starting
in 1995 from all fossil fuel-fired boilers under the utility's ownership or control. A Wisconsin utility that meets
certain requirements may trade emissions with another Wisconsin utility. One utility accepts_and adds to its annual
emissions_emissions from another utility, which subtracts those emissions from its annual emissions and thereby
reduces its annual average emissions rate in order to meet the utility-wide limit. Some commenters suggested that,
in initially allocating allowances to substitution units in Wisconsin, EPA consider only those Federal and State
limitations that are expressed as unit-specific limitations and not the utility-wide limits under Wisconsin's
acid rain law. These commenters supported an end-of-year review in which each Wisconsin utility will have to demonstrate
whether, if the allowances allocated to its substitution units in Wisconsin are treated as emissions by those units,
the utility will still be in compliance for that year with 1.2 lbs per mmBtu limit. In this demonstration, the utility
will sum the actual annual emissions of each boiler owned or controlled by the utility, except in the case of a substitution
unit where the allocated allowances will be used. Where emissions were traded for the year, traded emissions will
be subtracted by one utility from, and added by another utility to, the sum of emissions and allowances. The total will
be divided by the sum of the annual mmBtu utilization of all the boilers involved. To the extent that the result exceeds
1.2 lbs per mmBtu, the utility will be required to surrender, and EPA will deduct, allowances allocated to the substitution
units for that year. No commenters supported imposing limits on the ability to transfer the substitution unit's allowances
prior to the end-of-year review. However, one commenter opposed the use of any end-of-year review to apply the Wisconsin
utility-wide emissions limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is not deciding in the instant rulemaking what particular procedure will be used for applying non-specific
emissions limitations and whether to adopt an approach involving end-of-year review. However, such review may be
the best way to take account of the flexibility that the Wisconsin acid rain law and other State provisions provide
to individual units in meeting State emissions limitations. The final revised rule, therefore, allows EPA to decide
on a case-by-case basis, e.g., in individual permit proceedings on proposed substitution units, whether to require
end-of-year review to apply non-unit-specific emissions limitations. The final revised rule also authorizes the
Agency to require allowance surrender, and make allowance deductions, by the allowance transfer deadline as a result
of such review.

Contrary to one commenter's claim, the fact that section 402(3) of the Act defines ``allowance'' as ``an authorization

consistent with other sections of the Act, to surrender allowances. 42 U.S.C. 7651a(3). Section 403(f) of the Act

The Agency maintains that it is unnecessary to impose, pending any end-of-year review, limitations on the ability
to transfer a substitution unit's allowances. The risk that a substitution unit will not have allowances in its Allowance
Tracking System account to cover the deduction is small. As of the allowance transfer deadline, the unit's account
must contain, in any event, sufficient allowances to cover its emissions for the prior year. The deduction of allowances
resulting from the substitution unit's end-of-year review must be made before the Agency determines whether the
unit's emissions exceeded its available allowances. Consequently, the failure of the substitution unit to have
sufficient allowances to cover any deduction resulting from the end-of-year review will constitute a violation
of &sect;72.41 (and so the Clean Air Act itself) and will result in excess emissions and trigger excess emissions penalties.
Not only are limitations on transferability unnecesssary, but also they would reduce the compliance flexibility
that Congress intended to provide through substitution plans. The final rule therefore does not impose any limits
of transferability, pending any end-of-year review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In sum, the Agency concludes that a substitution unit should be allocated allowances based on the lesser of four emissions
rates for the unit: 1985 actual SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions rate; the greater of 1989 or 1990 actual SO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions rate, or the most stringent Federal or State allowable SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions rate applicable in 1995&hyph;99 as of November 15, 1990. The first two emissions rates are set forth in section
404(b)(2) of the Act. The latter rates are added in order to ensure, in accordance with section 404(b)(5), that a substitution
plan will result in at least the same amount of reductions that would have occurred without the plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This approach requires the submission to EPA of data on the 1989 and 1990 emissions rates and the emissions limitations
for 1995&hyph;99. For the reasons set forth in the November 18, 1993 preamble (58 FR 60956), the Agency maintains that
section 404(b) provides adequate authority to require submission of this data and to use the data to calculate the
allowance allocation under the plan.

c. Baseline. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the final revised rule, a substitution unit's allowance allocation is calculated by multiplying the lower
of the above-discussed emissions rates by the baseline, which reflects 1985&hyph;87 utilization. The January 11,
1993 regulations used baseline (and only the 1985 actual or allowable SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions rate) to calculate the allowance allocation. In the November 18, 1993 preamble, the Agency discussed the
options of basing allocations on utilization at the time a permit application is submitted or requiring utilities
to project what future utilization of the substitution units would be in Phase I without the substitution plan and
using the projected utilization to allocate allowances. No commenters supported the use of projected utilization,
and those that specifically addressed the matter preferred continued use of baseline. For the reasons set forth in
the preamble (58 FR 60956&hyph;57), the Agency concludes that a substitution unit's baseline should continue to
be used to calculate the allowance allocation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Limiting the Number of Substitution Units 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency rejects modifications of the January 11, 1993 regulations making upfront approval of the designation
of substitution units and allocation of allowances to such units contingent on an end-of-year review of the need for
such units for each year that the plan was in effect. Under such an approach, the Agency would allow only those designations
of substitution units that actually proved to be needed. No commenters supported that approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because allowance allocations for substitution units are limited as discussed above, the Agency concludes that
requiring end-of-year review of the need for substitution units and thereby limiting the number of such units is unnecessary.
If a substitution unit is not allocated allowances for emissions rate reductions that would have occurred without
a substitution plan, then the unit will use up all or most of its allocated allowances unless the unit made new emissions
rate reductions that would not otherwise have been made. To the extent that a substitution unit frees up allowances
by making such new emissions rate reductions, section 404(b)(1)(5) is not violated. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
58 FR 60957. In short, because today's final rule prevents any substitution unit from creating new, excess allowances,
there is no need to impose further requirements limiting the number of substitution units.

3. Requirement That the Substitution Unit Be Under Control of the Table A Unit's Owner or Operator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The January 11, 1993 regulations provide that the statutory requirement that the substitution unit be under the control
of the Table A unit's owner or operator is satisfied where such units have only a common designated representative.
This was based on the determination that a common designated representative qualifies, in such cases as an operator.
40 CFR 72.41(b)(1)(i); 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see also 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
42 U.S.C. 7651c(b). In the November 18, 1993 preamble, the Agency proposed to reverse its interpretation that having
a common designated representative, without more, meets this statutory requirement and to revise the regulations
accordingly. 58 FR 60957&hyph;60958. The Agency today adopts the reasoning, set forth in the November 18, 1993 preamble
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Id.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and in the preamble of the Acid Rain regulations on nitrogen oxides (59 FR 13554&hyph;55), that a designated representative
is not, merely by holding that position, also an operator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the preamble of the January 11, 1993 regulations, the Agency stated that, under some circumstances, a designated
representative's ``duties and level of responsibility can be equivalent to that of an operator.'' 58 FR 3600. One
such case, identified by the Agency, was where a designated representative represents multiple sources participating
in a substitution plan and otherwise lacking the same owner or operator. In that case, the designated representative's
responsibilities are allegedly ``broad enough to bring him or her within the definition of operator.'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Id. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed in the November 18, 1993 proposal and the March 22, 1994 final NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 rule, a designated representative's responsibilities in a multi-source substitution plan are not actually any
broader or more complex than they are under other compliance options. Therefore, there is no basis for treating a designated
representative in such a substitution plan any differently than a designated representative under any other compliance
option. In all such cases, a designated representative is not an operator. The final revised rule reflects this conclusion
by eliminating language from the January 11, 1993 regulations that provided that units with a common designated representative,
and nothing more, could participate in a substitution plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters note that, although &sect;72.41(b)(1)(i) requires that the substitution and Table A units have
``the same owner or operator'' (40 CFR 72.41(b)(1)(i) (1993)), section 404(b) itself states that the substitution
unit must be ``under the control of the owner or operator'' of the Table A unit. They argue that, in implementing section
404 (b) and (c), the Agency should focus on whether there is such control. They suggest that the ownership of the units
is not necessarily determinative of whether the control requirement is met. They allege that, on one hand, where the
units have multiple owners only one of which is in common, the control requirement may not be met. On the other hand,
where the units lack the same owner or operator, the control requirement allegedly may be met through contractual
arrangements under which the owner and operator of the substitution unit commit, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to make emissions reductions and deliver allowances to the owner and operator of the Phase I unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this final rule, the Agency is not addressing these additional issues concerning under what circumstances a proposed
substitution unit is considered to be under the control of the owners or operator of a Phase I unit. EPA is addressing
these issues, and the related comments, in a separate direct final rule in this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In order to preserve these issues for resolution, the Agency is adopting, in today's final rule, the statutory language
requiring that the owner or operator of the Phase I unit ``control'' the substitution unit that it designates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

4. Other Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency has adopted several other minor changes to clarify the current &sect;72.41. For example, as discussed
above, a substitution plan may distribute allowances between the substitution unit and the Table A unit. The final
rule makes it clear in &sect;72.41(c)(4)(ii) that, where there is more than one Table A unit in a plan, allowances may
be distributed from a substitution unit only to the Table A unit that designated that substitution unit. The final
rule also eliminates the superfluous, but potentially confusing, final sentence in that section of the January 11,
1993 rules because the sentence simply repeats the limitation in &sect;72.41(c)(3)(ii) on the total number of allowances
available under a substitution plan.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The January 11, 1993 regulations implementing substitution and reduced utilization plans pose similar problems
concerning the creation of excess, new allowances. However, because section 408(c)(1)(B) of the Act (unlike sections
404(b) and (c)) specifies the formula for allocating allowances, the Agency is adopting a different approach in modifying
the requirements for compensating units than the one adopted today for substitution units. In order to ensure that
reduced utilization plans are used as a means of accounting for emissions from load shifting from Phase I units and
not as a method of creating excess, new allowances through early entry of Phase II units into Phase I, the Agency must
limit the circumstances under which Phase II units can become compensating units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the November 18, 1993 notice of proposed rulemaking, the Agency suggested two options for limiting the designation
of compensating units: the first option requiring that the compensating units be actually needed to compensate for
reduced utilization and involving an end-of-year review of need; and the second option limiting up-front the category
of units that can qualify to become compensating units. The Agency is today rejecting the first option and is adopting
the second option with some modifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Limiting the Category of Units That Can Qualify as Compensating Units 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the option (Option 2 in the November 18, 1993 proposal) adopted today with some changes, the category of units
that may be designated as compensating units is limited to those units whose designation cannot create excess, new
allowances. The final revised rule provides that a unit can be designated as a compensating unit only if (1) the unit's
baseline multiplied by the lesser of the unit's 1985 actual or allowable SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions rate does not exceed (2) the baseline multiplied by the lesser of (i) the greater of the unit's 1989 or 1990
actual SO

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for 1995&hyph;99 as of November 15, 1990 plus (iii) the lesser of 10 percent of the tonnage calculated under (1) or 200
tons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with its conclusions concerning substitution units, the Agency maintains that excess allowances may
be created by the designation, as a compensating unit, of any Phase II unit whose baseline, multiplied by what its annual
SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions rate in Phase I would be in the absence of the designation, is less than the annual allowances allocated to
the unit as a compensating unit. Even if such a Phase II unit increases its own generation to provide compensating generation,
the unit may be able to use its own allowance allocation to cover its own emissions without making any more emission
rate reductions than it would have otherwise made. In addition, the unit may have extra allowances to transfer, sell,
or bank for future use. In order to prevent the creation of excess, new allowances, such units will not be allowed to
be designated as compensating units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, the Agency concludes that excess, new allowances are created when Phase II units
entering Phase I (e.g., compensating units) are allocated allowances for emissions rate reductions made, or mandated
by federal or State law adopted, before passage of title IV. The general approach in the final rule is to bar, from becoming
compensating units, those units that would otherwise receive such allocations if they were compensating units.
Units that qualify as compensating units will be allocated allowances under the formula in section 408(c)(1)(B),
i.e., baseline times the 1985 actual or allowable emissions rate.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Thus, despite the claim of some commenters, Option 2 of the proposal does not change the allocation formula, which
applies once it is determined that a unit qualifies as a compensating unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Contrary to some commenters, section 408(c)(1)(B) does not require the Administrator to approve whatever units
a utility designates as compensating for reduced utilization. The Administrator must approve only those compensating-unit
designations that are consistent with the purposes of title IV. 42 U.S.C. 7651h(c)(2). Section 408(c)(1)(B) does
not expressly require the Administrator to consider a unit's 1989 or 1990 actual emissions rate or its most stringent
emissions limitation. However, in reviewing proposed compensating units using these factors, the Agency is implementing
section 408(c)(1)(B) in a way that precludes ``a pattern or practice''_i.e., designation of compensating units
that would receive excess, new allowances_``that is counter to the intent of section 404 and *&blank;*&blank;* title
[IV of the Act].'' Senate Rep. 101&hyph;228 at 334. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This approach is similar to that adopted with regard to substitution units except that, while the final rule allows
units to become substitution units and adjusts their allocations, the final rule completely bars certain units from
becoming compensating units. Consistent with the provisions concerning substitution units, the provisions for
compensating units use the greater of the unit's 1989 or 1990 emissions rate as reasonably reflecting voluntary emissions
reductions made before passage of title IV. Similarly, the provisions for substitution units and the provisions
for compensating units take the same approach (including the treatment of non-unit-specific emissions limitations)
to using the most stringent federal or State emissions limitations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
section III(A)(1)(b) of this preamble. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, because some units could otherwise be completely barred from becoming compensating units because of very
small differences (e.g., due to normal variability in coal quality) between their 1985 emissions and their actual
or mandated emissions as of the passage of title IV, the Agency is building some extra flexibility into the provisions
governing compensating units. The final rule allows the designation of compensating units whose baseline times
the 1985 emissions rate is greater by only a very small amount (i.e., the lesser of 10 percent or 200 tons) than their
baseline times the lesser of their 1989 (or 1990) emissions rate or their most stringent emissions limitation for
Phase I. The flexibility band is measured in tons of emissions in order to ensure that the potential for creating excess,
new allowances is restricted. Further, the flexibility band is also limited as a percentage of 1985 emissions because
the band must apply to all potential compensating units, which can vary significantly in size and thus in total emissions.
Using only a percentage limit or only a specific tonnage would have an inconsistent impact on units of different sizes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the inherent unreliability of projected utilization figures (discussed above in section III(A)(1)(c)
of this preamble), baseline, not projected utilization, will be used to determine whether a unit qualifies as a compensating
unit. If a utilization projection less than baseline were used to determine that a unit qualified as a compensating
unit but subsequently the unit had a higher actual utilization in Phase I that would have otherwise disqualified the
unit, the unit could create excess, new allowances.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to be approved, the designation of a compensating unit, of course, must meet the requirements in the January
11, 1993 regulations for reduced utilization plans as well as the additional requirement imposed in today's final
revised rule. After determining that a particular proposed compensating unit meets all these upfront requirements,
the Agency will approve the designation and allocate allowances for the unit. The Agency will not conduct any end-of-year
review of the need for the compensating unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a designated representative of a Phase I unit has no Phase II unit that will provide compensating generation and
that meets all the upfront requirements for designation, the designated representative will not be required to submit
a reduced utilization plan designating a compensating unit. The allowance surrender provisions in &sect;&sect;72.91
and 72.92 will continue to apply.

2. End-of-Year Review of the Need for Compensating Units 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the rejected option (Option 1 in the November 18, 1993 proposal), units would have been allowed to remain as compensating
units and would have retained allocated allowances only where the compensating units were actually needed to account
for reduced utilization. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
58 FR 60959&hyph;60961. The Agency proposed in Option 1 to modify the reduced utilization provisions by granting
upfront approval of a reduced utilization plan with compensating units but making approval contingent on an end-of-year
determination by the Administrator that each compensating unit was needed for the year. A unit designated as a compensating
unit would have become a Phase I unit and would have been allocated allowances upon upfront approval of the reduced
utilization plan. However, a compensating unit would not have been allowed to transfer allowances allocated for
any given year in Phase I unless and until an end-of-year determination of need was made for that unit for that year.
If the unit was not shown to be needed, the unit would have been retroactively de-designated for the year and the allowances
allocated for the year would have been deducted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Option 1, a unit could be deemed, in the end-of-year review, to be needed as a compensating unit only for years
in which: the Phase I unit actually had utilization below baseline; the Phase I units in the initial Phase I unit's dispatch
system actually had total net utilization below the sum of their baselines after taking account of all sulfur-generation
acquired by the dispatch system; and the proposed compensating unit actually provided compensating generation
to that dispatch system. Further, the Administrator would determine how much compensating generation each compensating
unit proposed for any Phase I unit potentially could have provided. The only compensating unit designations that
would be allowed for any Phase I units in the dispatch system would be designations of compensating units whose potential
excess generation would have been necessary to meet the potential need for compensating generation for the dispatch
system as a whole. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is rejecting Option 1 because Option 2 is a simpler approach that ensures that, consistent with title IV
and Congressional intent, compensating units cannot be used to create excess, new allowances. In contrast to Option
2, Option 1 would require designated representatives to make complicated end-of-year demonstrations of need, summarized
above, and EPA to review and evaluate those demonstrations. Trading of allowances allocated to compensating units
would be inhibited in that such trading would be barred pending completion of the Agency's review.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Further, while Option 1 would reduce the number of compensating units and thus the total amount of excess, new allowances
that they could create, that option would not entirely eliminate the problem: those compensating units meeting the
requirements of Option 1 could still create some excess, new allowances. Finally, the vast majority of commenters
supported the use of Option 2 over Option 1.

Commenters addressed only two of these changes. Under the proposal and the final revised rule, where a sulfur-free
generator is designated outside a unit's dispatch system, the designated representative must submit, as part of
the reduced utilization plan, the contractual agreements governing the ``acquisition'' of electricity by the unit's
dispatch system from that generator. In addition, where a shift of generation from any designated sulfur-free generator
(whether the generator is within or outside the dispatch system) is claimed, the designated representative must
document that at least the amount claimed to have been shifted was actually ``acquired'' by the unit's dispatch system
from the generator. The January 11, 1993 regulations referred to the contractual agreements governing and documentation
concerning the ``purchase'', rather than the ``acquisition'', of electricity from sulfur-free generators.

 48 FR 3672 and 3682 (&sect;&sect;72.43(c)(4)(iv) and 72.91(a)(6) (1993)). Commenters supported this change adopted
in the November 18, 1993 proposal. Some sulfur-free generators have multiple owners and may be owned in part by the
unit's dispatch system. In such cases, the unit's dispatch system may not acquire electricity from the generator
through a ``purchase'' but rather may acquire the electricity based on its ownership share. Further, it is important
to ensure that multiple owners of sulfur-free generators claim only their respective shares of the sulfur-free generation.
Consequently, the Agency is requiring documentation concerning the ``acquisition,'' which encompasses not only
``purchases'' (as under the January 11, 1993 rule) but also acquisitions based on ownership. Further, the requirement
to document actual acquisition applies to all designated sulfur-free generators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that the documentation required, under the proposal, for acquisition of sulfur-free generation
is more stringent than necessary. The commenter noted that, under the proposal, the designated representative must
demonstrate that electricity was actually acquired from ``a particular sulfur-free generator.'' Comments of Oglethorpe
Power Corporation at 7. Allegedly, it is ``extremely difficult to trace energy back'' to the sulfur-free generator.

The commenter further alleged that requiring that ``a unit power or similar power sale agreement'' govern the acquisition
will result in ``significant regulatory or other approval delays.''

at 6. The commenter suggested that, instead of these requirements, the Agency require that the designated representative
of the Phase I unit simply obtain the consent of an owner of the sulfur-free generator to claim, for purposes of the reduced
utilization plan, some or all of that owner's share of generation from the sulfur-free generator. In order to ensure
that the designated representative does not make such claims without actually getting the consent of the generator-owner,
the commenter urged that EPA require that a copy of any reduced utilization plan involving a sulfur-free generator
be given to all owners of the generator and the designated representative of the Phase I unit certify to EPA that the
necessary consent was obtained.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the commenter's approach, a Phase I unit would be relieved of the obligation to surrender allowances simply
because it obtained the consent of an owner of a sulfur-free generator to ``claim'' some of that owner's electricity
from the generator. As explained by the commenter, there would not have to be any actual acquisition of electricity
by the dispatch system of the Phase I unit from the sulfur-free generator. However, the rationale for allowing the
Phase I unit to avoid surrendering allowances if it designates a sulfur-free generator is that the Phase I unit is replacing
the reduction in its own generation below its 1985&hyph;87 level with electricity from a source (i.e., a sulfur-free
generator) that does not emit any sulfur dioxide when producing that electricity. To the extent the Phase I unit replaces
its own reduced generation with electricity from units that emit sulfur dioxide in the process, allowances must be
surrendered in order to account for the emissions consequences of the reduced utilization of the Phase I unit. Otherwise,
the Phase I unit could bank its unused allowances ``notwithstanding the fact that actual emissions reductions had
not been paid for or achieved'' at that unit. 56 FR 63019. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency recognizes that the complexity of the movement of electricity through interconnected transmission and
distribution systems make it difficult to determine precisely the source of compensating generation. 56 FR 63023.
That does not mean that all efforts, in the allowance surrender procedure, to reflect actual electricity transactions
and to approximate resulting emissions should be abandoned. Under the commenter's approach, ``paper'' claims to
sulfur-free generation that may have no actual, underlying energy transactions could be used to avoid allowance
surrender. Such an approach would run contrary to the rationale for allowing the designation of sulfur-free generators
and therefore is rejected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, the final revised rule includes the requirements that the designated representative of the Phase I unit submit:
Contractual agreements that expressly provide for the acquisition of electricity by the unit's dispatch system
from the designated sulfur-free generator outside the dispatch system, which generator must be identified in the
agreements; and documentation that such acquisition from the identified generator actually took place. (Similarly,
to ensure that claims of compensating generation are based on actual transactions, the same approach is taken for
compensating units outside the dispatch system. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
58 FR 60961 (proposing parallel treatment of sulfur-free generators and compensating units).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of these requirements, commenter's concern_that Phase I units lacking a common owner with a sulfur-free
generator may claim to have acquired from the generator electricity that is actually sulfur-free generation retained
by an owner of the generator_is misplaced. A sulfur-free generator can be designated only by those Phase I units that
meet certain requirements. A Phase I unit whose dispatch system includes the generator may designate that generator.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
12
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the generator is outside the dispatch system of a Phase I unit, the Phase I unit may designate the generator if the
dispatch system has a contract specifically providing for the acquisition of electricity from the particular generator.
A contact to purchase power from the dispatch system of an owner of the sulfur-free generator, where the sulfur-free
generator is not specified as the source of the power, is not sufficient. If the dispatch system of the Phase I unit has
a contract specifically to purchase power generated at the sulfur-free generator and the contract is with a third
party that is not an owner of the generator, the designated representative must show that the third party in turn has
an agreement with an owner of the generator specifically to purchase power from the generator. Further, &sect;72.91(a)
(5) and (6) require that the designated representative document the amount of power actually acquired from the sulfur-free
generator and that the designated representatives of all Phase I units claiming generation from the same generator
must agree on apportionment of the available generation. It is difficult to see how a Phase I unit could take credit
for electricity legitimately claimed by an owner of the sulfur-free generator. Consequently, it is unnecessary
to impose the additional requirements suggested by the commenter.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
No contract to acquire power from the sulfur-free generator is required if the generator is in the Phase I unit's dispatch
system. Since a given sulfur-free generator can be included in only one dispatch system, Phase I units in any other
dispatch system must have such a contract in order to desigate the generator.

IV. Applicability of Rule Revisions to Existing Permit Applications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the November 18, 1993 proposal, the Agency requested comment on how to address any reliance by owners and operators
on the January 11, 1993 regulations. The Agency noted that it had proposed in draft Acid Rain permits to approve for
1995, under the January 11, 1993 regulations, those substitution plans and those reduced utilization plans with
compensating units that EPA determined to be in compliance with those regulations. 58 FR 60962. In a subsequent extension
of the period for comments on the November 18, 1993 proposal, the Agency requested comments on whether any of the allowances
allocated to substitution or compensating units under the January 11, 1993 regulations should be returned to EPA
at some future time. 59 FR 3660 (Jan. 26, 1994).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the November 18, 1993 proposal, it was also noted that, in the draft permits, EPA had proposed to defer action on those
compliance options with regard to 1996&hyph;1999 pending completion of the instant rulemaking. 58 FR 60962&hyph;60963.
In notices of draft permits, the Agency had stated that it intended to take this approach for all substitution and reduced
utilization plans submitted before July 16, 1993 but that, with regard to such plans submitted on or after July 16,
1993, it intended to defer action for all of Phase I on those compliance options until completion of the rulemaking.
58 FR 38371 (July 16, 1993); 58 FR 39542&hyph;39543 (July 23, 1993); 58 FR 40812 (July 30, 1993); 58 FR 42065 (Aug. 6,
1993); 58 FR 43107 (Aug. 13, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency had explained in draft permits, notices of draft permits, and the November 18, 1993 proposal that it was
taking the position that it had the authority under the January 11, 1993 regulations to defer action on compliance
options.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 See, e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 58 FR 60963. Nevertheless, the Agency proposed, in the November 18, 1993 notice of proposed rulemaking, to add language
to &sect;&sect;72.62 and 72.82 of the January 11, 1993 regulations ``making this authority more explicit.'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Id. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the Agency concludes that it is no longer necessary to defer action for any period on any substitution or reduced
utilization plans that have been submitted. The Agency has already issued direct final permits addressing these
plans for all years during 1995&hyph;1999 for which the plans were proposed. See, e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 59 FR 37755 (July 25, 1994); 59 FR 38454 (July 28, 1994); 59 FR 39339 (Aug. 2, 1994); and 59 FR 39767 (Aug. 4, 1994). Most
of the permits automatically became final. Significant, adverse comment was received on several permits, which
were reproposed and have now been issued in final form. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 59 FR 49395&hyph;49396 (Sept. 28, 1994). As provided in the May 4, 1994 settlement, the substitution and compensating
units designated in the plans are allocated allowances in Phase I under settlement provisions consistent with today's
final revised rule and receive for one or two years any additional allowances (referred to, in the settlement, as ``excess''
allowances) that would be provided under the January 11, 1993 regulations. Consistent with the May 4, 1994 settlement,
allowances equal to the number of additional allowances allocated for one or two years will be deducted from a future
year subaccount in the unit's Allowance Tracking System account. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, the Agency is withdrawing its position, set forth in draft permits, notices of draft permits, and the
November 18, 1993 proposal, that it has the authority under the January 11, 1993 regulations to defer action on compliance
options. The Agency is taking no position at this time on whether it has such authority. Further, under these circumstances,
the Agency is not adopting the revisions to &sect;&sect;72.62 and 72.82 as proposed on November 18, 1993. The comments
that were submitted on these proposed revisions and on the Agency's authority to defer action on compliance options
are therefore no longer relevant and require no response at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, the Agency is not addressing, in this rulemaking, questions concerning whether and how to apply today's
final revised rule to permit applications submitted to the Agency prior to the effective date of the final revised
rule. These matters_including the question of whether allowances allocated to substitution or compensating units
under the January 11, 1993 rules should be returned to EPA in the future_were addressed when, as noted above, the final
permits were issued with regard to these permit applications. The Agency considered, in the individual permit application
proceedings, both the comments on this matter submitted in this rulemaking and those comments submitted on the draft
permits.

Under Executive Order 12866, 58 FR 51735 (Oct. 4, 1993), the Administrator must determine whether the regulatory
action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review and the requirements

Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that this rule is a ``significant regulatory
action'' because the rule seems to raise novel legal or policy issues. As such, this action was submitted to OMB for
review. Any changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations are documented in the public record. Any
written comments from OMB to EPA and any written EPA response to those comments are included in the docket. The docket

, requires each federal agency to consider potential impacts of its regulations on small business ``entities.''
Under 5 U.S.C. 604(a), an agency issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking must prepare and make available for public
comment a regulatory flexibility analysis. Such an analysis is not required if the head of an agency certifies that
a rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the preamble of the January 11, 1993 regulations, the Administrator certified that those regulations, including
the provisions revised by today's final rule, would not have a significant impact. 58 FR 3649. The final rule revisions
adopted today are not significant enough to change the economic impact addressed in the preamble of the January 11,
1993 regulations, which were certified as not having a significant impact. The revisions will prevent the creation
of about 200,000 excess, new allowances and thus will have an annual impact of about $318,000 per year in Phase I, i.e.,
200,000 allowances times $159 (the weighted average winning bid for 1995 allowances in the EPA 1994 Allowance Auction

limitation and will not result in compensating units retaining allowances allocated under paragraph (d)(1) of this
section for emissions reductions necessary to meet a non-unit-specific emissions limitation. Such method may require
an end-of-year review and the disapproval and de-designation, and adjustment of the allowances allocated to, the

(iii) ``Shifts to designated sulfur-free generators'' is the reduction in utilization (in mmBtu), for the calendar
year, that is accounted for by all sulfur-free generators designated under the reduced utilization plan in effect
for the calendar year. This term equals the sum, for all such generators, of the ``shift to sulfur-free generator.''
``Shift to sulfur-free generator'' shall equal the amount, to the extent documented under paragraph (a)(6) of this

(iv) ``Shifts to designated compensating units'' is the reduction in utilization (in mmBtu) for the calendar year

in effect for the calendar year. This term equals the heat rate, under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, of the unit
reducing utilization multiplied by the sum, for all such compensating units, of the ``shift to compensating unit''
for each compensating unit. ``Shift to compensating unit'' shall equal the amount of compensating generation (in
Kwh), to the extent documented under paragraph (a)(6) of this section, that the designated representatives of the
unit reducing utilization and the compensating unit have certified (in their respective annual compliance certification
reports) as the amount that will be converted to mmBtus and used, in accordance with paragraph (a)(4) of this section,
in calculating the adjusted utilization for the compensating unit.

(4) ``Compensating generation provided to other units'' is the total amount of utilization (in mmBtu) necessary
to provide the generation (if any) that was shifted to the unit as a designated compensating unit under any other reduced
utilization plans that were in effect for the unit and for the calendar year. This term equals the heat rate, under paragraph
(a)(3) of this section, of such unit multiplied by the sum of each ``shift to compensating unit'' that is attributed
to the unit in the annual compliance certification reports submitted by the Phase I units under such other plans and
that is certified under paragraph (a)(3)(iv) of this section.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Title IV of the Clean Air Act, as amended by Public Law 101&hyph;549, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (the Act),
authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) to establish the Acid Rain Program. On January 11,
1993, the Agency promulgated final rules under title IV. Several parties filed petitions for review of the rules.
On August 10, 1994, EPA and other parties signed a settlement agreement addressing certain substitution plan issues.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on a review of the record, the Agency concludes that the January 11, 1993 regulations concerning the eligibility
of units to be designated as substitution units should be revised. Under sections 404(b) and (c) of the Act, a unit that
is not listed in Table A of section 404 as being subject to Phase I of the Acid Rain Program (i.e., a non-Table A unit) and
that is under the control of the owner or operator of a unit listed in Table A of section 404 (i.e., a Table A unit) may be
designated as a substitution unit. The January 11, 1993 regulations state that the Table A unit and each non-Table
A unit that the Table A unit designates as a substitution unit must have ``the same owner or operator.'' The Agency is
revising the regulations in order to specify more clearly the circumstances under which the statutory ``control''
requirement for substitution plans is met. The rule revision is being issued as a direct final rule because it is consistent
with the August 10, 1994 settlement and no adverse comment is expected.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 404(b) and (c) of the Act set forth the requirements for submission and approval of substitution plans, under
which a unit listed on Table A of section 404 designates one or more non-Table A units as substitution units and brings
them into Phase I of the Acid Rain Program. Congress established substitution plans as a compliance option to increase
units' compliance flexibility and reduce their overall costs of compliance in Phase I while still achieving the emissions
reductions intended by Congress under title IV. See 58 FR 60950&hyph;60951 (Nov. 18, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A substitution plan allows the owner or operator of a Table A unit to reassign the unit's emissions reduction obligations
to a designated non-Table A unit ``under the control of'' that owner or operator. 42 U.S.C. 7651c(b). Upon approval
of the reassignment, the non-Table A unit becomes subject to all requirements for Phase I units with regard to sulfur
dioxide and is allocated allowances. Emissions reductions by the non-Table A unit may therefore free up allowances,
which may be used by the Table A unit (or any other unit) in lieu of making emissions reductions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 71.41 of the January 11, 1993 regulations provided that the statutory requirement of control by the Table
A unit's owner or operator over the non-Table A unit is satisfied where such units have ``the same owner or operator.''
40 CFR 72.41(b)(1)(i) (1993). The regulation also provided that having the same designated representative would
be treated as having the same operator and would thus meet the control requirement.

; see also 58 FR 3600. On March 12, 1993, petitions for review of the January 11, 1993 regulations were filed with the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Several petitioners challenged the provisions implementing
the control requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 18, 1993, the Agency issued proposed revisions to the January 11, 1993 regulations, including the provisions
concerning the control requirement. The Agency proposed to reverse its interpretation that having a common designated
representative alone meets the statutory control requirement for substitution plans and to revise the regulations
accordingly. 58 FR 60957&hyph;60958. Several commenters addressed the control requirement in their comments on
the November 18, 1993 proposal. Some commenters opposed any change in the January 11, 1993 provisions concerning
the control requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters noted that, although &sect;72.41(b)(1)(i) requires that the substitution and Table A units have
``the same owner or operator'' (40 CFR 72.41(b)(1)(i) (1993)), section 404(b) of the Act requires that the substitution
unit be under the control of the Table A unit owner or operator. They argued that, in implementing section 404(b) and
(c), the Agency should also focus on whether there is such control. They suggested that common ownership of the units
is not necessarily determinative of whether the control requirement is met. They alleged that where the units have
multiple owners only one of which is in common, the control requirement may not be met, e.g., where the common owner
owns only a very small percentage of the proposed substitution unit. On the other hand, where the units lack any common
owner or operator, the control requirement allegedly may be met through contractual arrangements under which the
owner and operator of the substitution unit commit, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, to make emissions reductions and deliver allowances to the owner and operator of the Phase I unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a separate final rule in this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the Agency adopted the reasoning, set forth in the November 18, 1993 preamble (58 FR 60957&hyph;60958) and in the
preamble of the Acid Rain regulations on nitrogen oxides (59 FR 13554&hyph;13555 (Mar. 22, 1994)), that a designated
representative is not, merely by holding that position, also an operator. In that separate final rule, the Agency
revised the January 11, 1993 regulations to use the statutory language requiring control by the Table A unit owner
or operator and to provide that having a common designated representative does not alone meet the control requirement
for substitution units. However, the Agency did not address in that separate document comments raising issues concerning:
under what circumstances the existence of one or more common owners satisfies the control requirement; and whether
and, if so, under what circumstances control can be established by contract if there are no common owners or common
operators. The Agency addresses below those issues and the comments on those issues.

II. Modifications of the January 11, 1993 Regulation Concerning the Control Requirement for Substitution Units
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Control by Common Owner or Operator
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 404(b) of the Act allows that the ``owner or operator'' of a Table A unit to designate, as a substitution unit,
a non-Table A unit ``under the control of such owner or operator.'' 42 U.S.C. 7651c(b). The Agency agrees with commenters
that, like section 404(b), the regulation implementing that section should focus on whether such control exists.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because many units have multiple owners with varying percentages of ownership, there is a wide range of possible relationships
between a Table A unit and a non-Table A unit, ranging, for example, from no common ownership to 100% common ownership
and including all the possible variations in between. In order to avoid burdensome case-by-case determinations
of whether each particular set of facts meets the control requirement and in order to provide more certainty for utilities
and the public concerning what units qualify for inclusion in substitution plans, the Agency is establishing generic
criteria for applying the control requirement. Further, the generic criteria are based on the potential ability
of owners and operators to exercise control, not the actual exercise of such control potential. Determining what
entities actually make decisions governing the operation of a unit could require the Agency to make lengthy case-by-case
inquiries into the details of utility operations and involve the Agency in matters beyond its expertise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In taking this approach, the Agency maintains that section 404(b) should be interpreted to require that owners or
operators of a Table A unit have the ability to exercise a significant degree of control over a non-Table A unit. The
simplest case for applying this requirement is where the Table A and non-Table A units have only a single owner or where,
regardless of their ownership, the units have a common operator. Under these circumstances, it seems clear that the
single owner or the operator of the Table A unit has the ability to control the non-Table A unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For units with multiple owners, the application of the control requirement becomes somewhat more complex if they
do not have a common operator. If one or more owners and operators of a Table A unit own an aggregate share of 50% or more
of the capacity of a non-Table A unit, no major decisions concerning the unit can be made without the concurrence of
such Table A unit owners and operators. The Agency maintains, therefore, that they can control the non-Table A unit
to a significant extent and meet the control requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even where the aggregate ownership share of the one or more owners and operators of a Table A unit in a non-Table A unit
is less than 50%, the degree of control may still be significant. Such control is evidenced by the ability of such non-Table
A unit owners to determine the dispatch of their respective shares of electricity generated by the non-Table A unit.
Decisions by such owners whether or not to take their shares of generation can significantly affect the overall operation
of the unit. While the Agency recognizes that adopting a minimum level of ownership in the non-Table A unit for meeting
the control requirement is necessarily somewhat arbitrary, the Agency maintains that, as a matter of logic, there
is some level of ownership below which the owners lack significant control. Further, establishing such a minimum
level of ownership discourages gaming through the acquisition of minute ownership shares simply to enable the new
owner to qualify the non-Table A unit as a substitution unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes that an aggregate ownership interest of 10% or more, and less than 50%, of the capacity of the non-Table
A unit meets the control requirement, provided that such owners have the ability to determine how their respective
shares of the non-Table A unit's generation are dispatched. The Agency notes that, in some regions of the country,
utilities have entered into power pool agreements under which the utilities agree to centralize in the power pool
the dispatch of their units. Power pools with central economic dispatch enable member utilities to minimize operating
costs through the use of the units in the pool that have the lowest generation costs. In light of the important benefits
of such power pools, the Agency maintains that utilities in power pools should not be disadvantaged under section
404(b). Consequently, the determination of whether owners of a non-Table A unit have, by right of contract, the ability
to dispatch their respective shares of the unit's generation should be made without regard to whether owners that
had contractual dispatch authority have surrendered that authority to a power pool. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In sum, the Agency is establishing generic criteria for determining whether the control requirement under section
404(b) is met. The first category that meets this requirement is where one or more owners or operators of a Table A unit
have an aggregate ownership interest of 50% or more in the non-Table A unit or where the two units have a common operator.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The second category that meets the control requirement is where: a Table A and non-Table A unit lack a common operator;
one or more owners or operators of a Table A unit have an aggregate ownership interest of 10% or more and less than 50%
in the non-Table A unit; and such owners or operators have the contractual ability to determine the dispatch of their
respective shares of the non-Table A unit's generation. The final regulation requires the designated representatives
submitting substitution plans to state in the submission what category is applicable to the units in the plan and to
provide, upon request, documentation supporting such statements. These statements, like all information included
in submissions by the designated representative, are covered by the certification required under &sect;72.21(b)
concerning the truth, accuracy, and completeness of the statements.

In summing the ownership shares of individual Table A unit owners and operators in the capacity of a non-Table unit,
a given share, and the generation associated with such share, obviously cannot be double-counted. Otherwise, the
sum of the ownership shares of all persons owning a non-Table A unit could exceed 100%.

B. Control by Contract 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency agrees that, under certain circumstances, control over a substitution unit by the owners and operators
of the Table A unit may be established by contract where the above-described criteria based on a common operator or
the level of common ownership are not met. The contract must be a binding agreement between the owners and operators
of a Table A unit and the owners and operators of the non-Table A unit that is designated as the Table A unit's substitution
unit. Several commenters supported an interpretation of section 404(b) that would allow the control requirement
to be met through a contract. The final regulation specifies the circumstances under which the Administator will
find that control is established by contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several determinations have guided the Agency's development of the regulation concerning control by contract.
First, the Agency believes that the regulation should set forth detailed, generic requirements for establishing
control by contract. Leaving the specification of detailed requirements to case-by-case development would increase
the burden both on the owners and operators interested in submitting contract-based substitution plans and on the
Agency, which must review such submissions. A commenter supporting the approval of contract-based substitution
plans suggested that the Agency develop generic criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the Agency believes that the control requirement of section 404(b) of the Act should be interpreted in light
of the emissions reduction goals of title IV. The Agency maintains that a determination of whether control is established
by contract should focus on whether the owners and operators of the Table A unit have the ability, under the contract,
to require emissions reductions by the non-Table A unit and thereby to affect the overall operation of the unit. It
is not necessary in this context for the Table A unit's owners and operators to have contractual authority over all
facets of the non-Table A unit's day-to-day operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, if the control requirement is to be met by simply showing that Table A unit owners and operators have the ability,
by contract, to require emissions reductions by the non-Table A unit, the Agency maintains that the contract must
require emissions reductions that are significant, new reductions that would not otherwise have been implemented
by the non-Table A unit. It is difficult to see how control could be demonstrated if a contract with a Table A unit merely
required a non-Table A unit to ``make'' reductions that the non-Table A unit had already implemented, was already
in the process of implementing, or would have implemented even in the absence of the contract. Further, because a unit
might be able to realize relatively minor reductions while making little change in its operations, the scale of the
reductions required by contract should be significant in order to demonstrate control of the non-Table A unit by owners
and operators that otherwise lack any operational responsibilities for that unit. A commenter suggested that the
contract between the Table A and non-Table A units should specify a percentage emissions rate reduction that the non-Table
A unit is required to achieve.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure that the contract requires significant, new reductions by the non-Table A unit, the final regulation requires
that the contract establish a maximum annual average SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions rate for the unit. The maximum emissions rate must be less than or equal to 70% of the lesser of the following
emissions rates for the non-Table A unit: the 1985 actual SO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The latter set of emissions rates (i.e., the current actual and allowable rates) are included to ensure that the required
reduction in the unit's emissions rate is at least 30% of the emissions rate achieved, or required to be achieved, by
the non-Table A unit around the time of the submission of the substitution plan. The other emissions rates (i.e., those
for 1985, 1989, 1990, and Phase I) are used to ensure that the current actual or allowable rate does not represent a spike
in the emissions rate achieved by or required for the unit since 1985.

Some units are subject to a non-unit-specific emissions limit (e.g., a utility-wide emissions tonnage or rate limit).
The final regulation provides that if such a unit is designated as a substitution unit in a contract-based substitution
plan, the Administrator will determine on a case-by-case basis how to apply the non-unit-specific limit in setting
the maximum annual SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

, these other emissions rates are also used to allocate allowances for any substitution unit and to ensure that allowances

The Agency maintains that a 30% reduction in the emissions rate that the non-Table A unit would otherwise achieve represents
a significant reduction. A commenter supporting approval of contract-based substitution plans asserted that it
has identified about 30 Phase II units that lack a common owner or operator with a Table A unit and for which such plans
would be economically feasible. The commenter stated that this group of units could reduce their current emissions
rates by 50 to 70% and indicated that a 30% reduction might be an acceptable requirement for approval of this type of
substitution plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a further means of ensuring that the non-Table A unit's reductions are new, the final regulation requires that the
contract-based substitution plan include a description of the actions that will be undertaken so that the non-Table
A unit will comply with the maximum emissions rate. Such actions may include, for example, the addition or modification
of a scrubber or fuel switching. The owners and operators of the Table A and non-Table A units must show that the described
actions will not be implemented in Phase I unless the non-Table A unit is approved as a substitution unit. The description
of the actions that will be taken must be sufficiently detailed so that the Agency can determine whether the showing
has been made. Information relevant to the showing includes, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, whether contracts implementing these actions were entered into before submission of the substitution plan. Under
the regulation, the owners and operators must implement the described actions but may seek to amend the substitution
plan to change the required actions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, the Agency maintains that it is difficult to make determinations, particularly in a large number of cases,
of whether owners and operators will take certain future actions in the absence of a substitution plan. However, the
Agency must make a determination of this type in reviewing the actions described in each contract-based substitution
plan in order to make sure that the non-Table A unit is really obligated to make new reductions. This will be a one-time
determination made when the plan is approved (or disapproved) unless the designated representative subsequently
seeks to modify the description of actions in the plan. Further, the Agency does not expect a large number of contract-based
substitution plans to be submitted. As noted above, commenters have identified only about 30 units for which such
a plan would be economic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fourth, it is important to ensure that the contract imposes an effective emissions reduction requirement_i.e.,
a requirement that is likely to be enforced by Table A unit owners and operators claiming control of the non-Table A
unit. Consequently, the contract should include a meaningful remedy in the event that the required emissions reductions
are not achieved. The concept of requiring a meaningful remedy in the event of default was supported by a commenter.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the Table A unit owners and operators must surrender allowances to the Administrator to the extent that the non-Table
A unit fails to make the required emissions reductions, then the Table A owners and operators will bear responsibility
for the reductions that they claim to control and will have the incentive to take actions to ensure achievement of the
reductions. This puts the Table A owners and operators in a position similar to that of owners and operators that control
a unit directly by owning or operating the unit. If, instead of such allowance surrender by the Table A unit, the non-Table
A unit had to give allowances to the Table A unit (or to the Agency), then the Table A unit owners and operators would bear
no responsibility for the non-Table A unit that they claim to control. Further, without elaborate limitations on
the transfer of allowances between the Table A and non-Table A units, there would be no way of preventing the units from
arranging a future return to the non-Table A unit of any allowances surrendered by the non-Table A unit to the Table
A unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the final regulation, if the non-Table A unit fails to comply with the maximum emissions rate during the year,
the Table A unit owners and operators must surrender a number of allowances equal to the non-Table A unit's baseline
multiplied by the difference between the actual emissions rate for the year and the maximum emissions rate. This approach
segregates out the effect of utilization changes and leaves such changes to be handled under the reduced utilization
and allowance surrender provisions (e.g., &sect;&sect;72.43, 72.91, and 72.92) applicable to all Phase I units.
The surrendered allowances must have the same or an earlier compliance use date as the allowances allocated to the
non-Table A unit for the year, and the surrender must be made on or before the allowance transfer deadline. In order
to encourage early reductions at non-Table A units and innovative approaches to achieving such reductions, the surrender
and deduction of allowances will be the only remedy under the Act for failure to meet the maximum emissions rate. Of
course, the deduction of allowances for failure to achieve the maximum emissions rate may result in a unit having insufficient
allowances to cover its annual emissions, and the full panoply of remedies for excess emissions will then apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, in order to facilitate the Table A unit owners' and operators' exercise of control and the Agency's review
and enforcement, where necessary, of the substitution plan, the units involved should have a common designated representative.
A commenter supported the need for a common designated representative for this type of substitution plan.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The final regulation provides that the requirement to have a common designated representative is not met by simply
having a common alternate designated representative. This is because, as explained in the preamble of the November
18, 1993 proposed rule, an alternate designated representative does not carry the same level of responsibilities
as, and thus is not equivalent to, a designated representative. 58 FR 60958.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The commenter also suggested that the non-Table A owners and operators be required to submit quarterly and annual
reports to the Table A unit owners and operators and to indemnify such owners and operators for any violations at the
non-Table A unit. These requirements are not in the final rule because the Agency believes that these matters are not
central to the issue of control and are better left to the owners and operators of the two units.

C. Plan Termination if Control Requirement is no Longer met
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The January 11, 1993 regulations provide that where, as a result of ownership or other changes, the units in a substitution
plan no longer meet the common owner or operator requirement in those regulations, the substitution plan must be terminated.
The final regulation adopted here takes a similar approach. If there are changes that result in the control requirement
no longer being met, the designated representative must terminate the plan, whether the plan is based on common owners
or operators or on a contract. The Administrator may, on his or her own motion, terminate the plan under such circumstances.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The only exception to this requirement is for substitution plans approved, and included in final permits issued,
under the January 11, 1993 regulations and the Partial Settlement in

continue to meet the common owner, operator, or designated representative requirement in the January 11, 1993 regulations,
such plans will not be terminated for the first year (and, in some cases, for the second year) for which the substitution
unit received a total number of allowances equal to the number provided in those regulations. This exception is consistent

, requires each Federal agency to consider potential impacts of its regulations on small business ``entities.''
Under 5 U.S.C. 604(a), an agency issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking must prepare and make available for public
comment a regulatory flexibility analysis. Such an analysis is not required if the head of an agency certifies that
a rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b).

In the preamble of the January 11, 1993 regulations, the Administrator certified that those regulations, including
the provisions revised by today's final rule, would not have a significant impact. 58 FR 3649. The final rule revisions
adopted today are not significant enough to change the economic impact addressed in the preamble of the January 11,
1993 regulations, which were certified as not having a significant impact. Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C.

(5) A demonstration that the substitution plan meets the requirement that each unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this
section is under the control of the owner or operator of each unit under paragraph (a)(1) of this section that designates
the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section as a substitution unit. The demonstration shall be one of the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If the unit under paragraph (a)(1) of this section has one or more owners or operators that have an aggregate percentage
ownership interest of 50 percent or more in the capacity of the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section or the units
have a common operator, a statement identifying such owners or operators and their aggregate percentage ownership
interest in the capacity of the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section or identifying the units' common operator.
The designated representative shall submit supporting documentation upon request by the Administrator.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the unit under paragraph (a)(1) of this section has one or more owners or operators that have an aggregate percentage
ownership interest of at least 10 percent and less than 50 percent in the capacity of the unit under paragraph (a)(2)
of this section and the units do not have a common operator, a statement identifying such owners or operators and their
aggregate percentage ownership interest in the capacity of the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this seciton and stating
that each such owner or operator has the contractual right to direct the dispatch of the electricity that, because
of its ownership interest, it has the right to receive from the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The fact
that the electricity that such owner or operator has the right to receive is centrally dispatched through a power pool
will not be the basis for determining that the owner or operator does not have the contractual right to direct the dispatch
of such electricity. The designated representative shall submit supporting documentation upon request by the Administrator.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A copy of an agreement that is binding on the owners and operators of the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section
and the owners and operators of the unit under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, provides each of the following elements,
and is supported by documentation meeting the requirements of paragraph (c)(6) of this section:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The owners and operators of the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section must not allow the unit to emit sulfur
dioxide in excess of a maximum annual average SO

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions rate (in lbs/mmBtu), specified in the agreement, for each year during the period that the substitution
plan is in effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The maximum annual average SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions rate for the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall not exceed 70 percent of the lesser of: the
unit's 1985 actual SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions limitation for the unit for four consecutive quarters that immediately precede the 30-day period ending
on the date the substitution plan is submitted to the Administrator. If the unit is covered by a non-unit-specific
federally enforceable or State enforceable SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions limitation in the four consecutive quarters or, as of November 15, 1990, in Phase I, the Administrator will
determine, on a case-by-case basis, how to apply the non-unit-specific emissions limitation for purposes of determining
whether the maximum annual average SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions rate meets the requirement of the prior sentence. If a non-unit-specific federally enforceable SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions limitation is not different from a non-unit-specific federally enforceable SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions limitation that was effective and applicable to the unit in 1985, the Administrator will apply the non-unit-specific
SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions rate, the designated representative of the unit under paragraph (a)(1) of this section must surrender
allowances for deduction from the Allowance Tracking System account of the unit under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
The designated representative shall surrender allowances authorizing emissions equal to the baseline of the unit
under paragraph (a)(2) of this section multiplied by the difference between the actual SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

of the exceedance, and the surrendered allowances shall have the same or an earlier compliance use date as the allowances
allocated to the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section for that year. The designated representative may identify
the serial numbers of the allowances to be deducted. In the absence of such identification, allowances will be deducted
on a first-in, first-out basis under &sect;73.35(c)(2) of this chapter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) The unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section and the unit under paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall designate
a common designated representative during the period that the substitution plan is in effect. Having a common alternate
designated representative shall not satisfy the requirement in the prior sentence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

description will not be implemented during Phase I unless the unit remains a substitution unit. The permit revision
will be treated as an administrative amendment, except where the Administrator determines that the change in the
description alters the fundamental nature of the actions to be taken and that public notice and comment will contribute
to the decision-making process, in which case the permit revision will be treated as a permit modification or, at the
option of the designated representative, a fast-track modification.

), an endangered species, into Yellowstone National Park, which is located in Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana. These
wolves will be classified as nonessential experimental wolves according to section 10(j) of the Endangered Species
Act of 1973 (Act), as amended. Gray wolf populations have been extirpated from most of the Western United States. They
presently occur in a small population in extreme northwestern Montana, and as incidental occurrences in Idaho, Wyoming,
and Washington due to wolves dispersing from populations in Montana and Canada. This reintroduction plan is to reestablish
a viable wolf population in the Yellowstone area, one of three wolf recovery areas identified in the Northern Rocky
Mountain Wolf Recovery Plan. Potential effects of this final rule were evaluated in an Environmental Impact Statement
(EIS) completed in May 1994. This gray wolf reintroduction does not conflict with existing or anticipated Federal
agency actions or traditional public uses of park lands, wilderness areas, or surrounding lands.

1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Legal: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Endangered Species Act Amendments of 1982, Pub. L. 97&hyph;304, made significant changes to the Endangered Species
Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
including the creation of section 10(j), which provides for the designation of specific animals as ``experimental.''
Under previous authorities in the Act, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) was permitted to reintroduce
a listed species into unoccupied portions of its historic range for conservation and recovery purposes. However,
local opposition to reintroduction efforts from certain parties concerned about potential restrictions, and prohibitions
on Federal and private activities contained in sections 7 and 9 of the Act, reduced the utility of reintroduction as
a management tool. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 10(j), a listed species reintroduced outside of its current range, but within its historic range, may
be designated, at the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary), as ``experimental.'' This designation
increases the Service's flexibility and discretion in managing reintroduced endangered species because such experimental
animals may be treated as a threatened species. The Act requires that animals used to form an experimental population
be separated geographically from nonexperimental populations of the same species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional management flexibility is possible if the experimental animals are found to be ``nonessential'' to the
continued existence of the species in question. Nonessential experimental animals located outside national wildlife
refuges or national park lands are treated for purposes of section 7 of the Act, as if they were only proposed for listing.
Consequently, only two provisions of section 7 would apply to animals located outside of national wildlife refuges
and national parks_section 7(a)(1) and section 7(a)(4). Section 7(a)(1) requires all Federal agencies to establish
conservation programs for the particular species. Utilization of Federal public lands, including national parks
and national forests, is consistent with the legal responsibility of these agencies to sustain the native wildlife
resources of the United States and to use their authorities to further the purposes of the Act by carrying out conservation
programs for endangered and threatened species. Section 7(a)(4) requires all Federal agencies to informally confer
with the Service on actions that will likely jeopardize the continued existence of the proposed to be listed as threatened
or endangered species. The results of a conference are advisory in nature, and agencies are not required to refrain
from committing resources to projects as a result of a conference. In addition, section 10(j) of the Act states that
nonessential experimental animals are not subject to the formal consultation of the Act unless they occur on land
designated as a national wildlife refuge or national park. Activities undertaken on private lands are not affected
by section 7 of the Act unless they are funded, authorized, or carried out by a Federal agency.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Specimens used to establish an experimental population may be removed from a source or donor population, provided
their removal is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the species, and appropriate permits have been
issued in accordance with 50 CFR 17.22. Gray wolves for the reintroduction will be obtained from healthy Canadian
wolf populations with permission from the Canadian and Provincial governments. Gray wolves are common in western
Canada (tens of thousands) and Alaska (about 7,000). No adverse biological impact is expected from the removal of
about 150 wolves from the Canadian population. Consequently, the Service finds that wolves to be used in the reintroduction
effort meet the definition of ``non-essential'' (50 CFR 17.80(b)) because the loss of the reintroduced wolves is
not likely to appreciably reduce the likelihood of survival of the species in the wild. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1967, the timber wolf was listed as a subspecies (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Canis lupus lycaon
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) as endangered (32 FR 4001), and in 1973 the northern Rocky Mountain subspecies, as then understood, (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. l. irremotus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) was also listed as endangered, as was the Texas subspecies (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. l. monstrabilis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (38 FR 14678). In 1978, the legal status of the gray wolf in North America was clarified by listing the Minnesota wolf
population as threatened and other members of the species south of Canada were listed as endangered, without referring
to subspecies (43 FR 9607). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Biological: This final rule deals with the gray wolf (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Canis lupus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), an endangered species of carnivore that was extirpated from the western portion of the conterminous United States
by about 1930. The gray wolf is native to most of North America north of Mexico City, except for the southeastern United
States, where a similar species, the red wolf (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Canis rufus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), is found. The gray wolf occupied nearly every area in North America that supported populations of hoofed mammals
(ungulates), its major food source. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Twenty-four distinct subspecies of gray wolf had been recognized in North America. Recently, however, taxonomists
have suggested that there are five or fewer subspecies or group types of gray wolf in North America and that the wolf
type that once occupied the northern Rocky Mountains of the United States was more widely distributed than was previously
believed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The gray wolf occurred historically in the northern Rocky Mountains, including mountainous portions of Wyoming,
Montana, and Idaho. The drastic reduction in the distribution and abundance of this species in North America was directly
related to human activities, such as the elimination of native ungulates, conversion of wildland into agricultural
lands, and extensive predator control efforts by private, State, and Federal agencies. The natural history of wolves
and their ecological role was poorly understood during the period of their eradication in the conterminous United
States. As with other large predators, wolves were considered a nuisance and threat to humans. Today, the gray wolf's
role as an important and necessary part of natural ecosystems is better understood and appreciated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For 50 years prior to 1986, no detection of wolf reproduction was found in the Rocky Mountain portion of the United States.
However in 1986, a wolf den was discovered near the Canadian border in Glacier National Park. This find was presumably
due to the southern expansion of the Canadian wolf population. The Glacier National Park wolf population has steadily
grown to about 65 wolves and now exists throughout northwestern Montana. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reproducing wolf populations are not known to occur in Idaho or Wyoming. Wolves have occasionally been sighted in
these States, but do not constitute a population as defined by scientific experts (Service 1994). Historical reports
suggest that wolves may have produced young in these States; however, based on extensive surveys and interagency
monitoring efforts (Service 1994), no wolf population presently persists in these States.

Wolf Recovery Efforts: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the 1970's, the State of Montana led an interagency recovery team, established by the Service, that developed a
recovery plan for the Northern Rocky Mountain Gray Wolf. The 1980 recovery plan recommended a combination of natural
recovery and reintroduction be used to recover wolves in the area around Yellowstone National Park (the Park) north
to the Canadian border, including central Idaho. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A revised recovery plan was approved by the Service in 1987 (Service 1987). It identified a recovered wolf population
as being at least 10 breeding pairs of wolves, for 3 consecutive years, in each of 3 recovery areas (northwestern Montana,
central Idaho, and Yellowstone). A population of this size would be comprised of about 300 wolves. The plan recommended
natural recovery in Montana and Idaho. If two wolf packs did not become established in central Idaho within 5 years,
the plan recommended that conservation measures other than natural recovery be considered. The plan recommended
use of the Act's section 10(j) authority to reintroduce experimental wolves in the Park. By establishing a nonessential
experimental population, more liberal management practices may be implemented to address potential negative impacts
or concerns regarding the reintroduction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;512), Congress directed appointment of a Wolf Management Committee, composed of three
Federal, three State, and four interest group representatives, to develop a plan for wolf restoration in the Park
and central Idaho. That committee provided a majority, but not unanimous, recommendation to Congress in May 1991.
Among the measures recommended was a declaration by Congress directing reintroduction of wolves in the Park, and
possibly central Idaho, as special nonessential experimental populations with flexible management practices
by agencies and the public to resolve potential conflicts. Wolves and ungulates would be intensively managed by the
States with Federal funding; thus, implementation was expected to be costly. Congress took no action on the committee's
recommendation which would have required an amendment to the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In November 1991 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;154), Congress directed the Service, in consultation with the National Park Service
and Forest Service, to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to consider a broad range of alternatives
on wolf reintroduction in Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho. In 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;381), Congress
directed the Service to complete the EIS by January 1994 and indicated the preferred alternative should be consistent
with existing law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service formed and funded an interagency team to prepare the EIS. Team participants were the National Park Service;
Forest Service; the States of Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana; USDA Animal Damage Control; and Wind River and Nez Perce
Tribes. The Gray Wolf EIS program emphasized public participation. In the spring of 1992, the news media and nearly
2,500 groups/individuals interested in wolves were contacted to publicize the EIS process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In April 1992, a series of 27 ``issue scoping'' open houses were held in Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho, as well as 7 other
locations throughout the United States. The meetings were attended by nearly 1,800 people, and thousands of brochures
were distributed. In total, nearly 4,000 people gave comments on EIS issues. In July 1992, a report narrating the public
comments was mailed to 16,000 people. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In August 1992, 27 additional ``alternative scoping'' open houses and 3 additional hearings were held in Wyoming,
Montana, and Idaho. Hearings were also held in Seattle, Washington; Salt Lake City, Utah; and Washington, D.C. Two
major newspapers with circulation in Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho (total circulation about 250,000) distributed
a copy of the alternative scoping brochure in the Sunday edition. Nearly 2,000 people attended the meetings, and nearly
5,000 comments were received on methods for managing reintroduced wolves. Public comments typified the strong polarization
of concerns regarding wolf management. A report on the public's ideas and suggestions was mailed to about 30,000 people
in November 1992. In April 1993, a Gray Wolf EIS planning update report was published. It discussed the status of the
EIS, provided factual information on wolves, and requested the public to report wolf observations in the northern
Rocky Mountains. It was mailed to nearly 40,000 interested individuals residing in all 50 States and over 40 foreign
countries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public comment period on the draft EIS (DEIS) began on July 1, 1993, and the notice of availability was published
on July 16. The DEIS documents were mailed to potentially affected agencies, public libraries, interested groups,
and anyone who requested a copy. Additionally, a flyer containing the DEIS summary, a schedule of the 16 public hearings,
and a request to report wolf sightings was inserted into the Sunday edition of 6 newspapers (combined circulation
of about 280,000) in Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho. In mid-June 1993, the Service mailed a letter to over 300 groups,
primarily in Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho, offering a presentation on the DEIS. This resulted in 31 presentations
to about 1,000 people during the comment period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the DEIS public review period (July 1 to November 26, 1993) over 160,200 individuals, organizations, and government
agencies commented. The magnitude of the response shows the strong interest people have in wolf management. In early
March 1994, a summary of the public comments was mailed to about 42,000 people on the EIS mailing list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final EIS was filed with the Environmental Protection Agency on May 4, 1994, and the notice of availability was
published on May 9, 1994. The EIS considered five alternatives: (1) Reintroduction of Wolves Designated as Experimental,
(2) Natural Recovery (No action), (3) No Wolves, (4) Wolf Management Committee Recommendations, and (5) Reintroduction
of Wolves Designated as Nonexperimental. After careful review, the Service's proposed action was to reintroduce
nonessential experimental gray wolves in the Park and central Idaho.

The Secretary signed the EIS Record of Decision on June 15, 1994. A letter of concurrence was signed by the Secretary
of Agriculture on July 13, 1994. The decision directed the Service to implement its proposed action plan as soon as
practical. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Two nonessential experimental population proposed rules, one for the Park and one for central Idaho, were published

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 16, 1994 (59 FR 42108 and 59 FR 42118, respectively). On September 6, 1994, a brochure containing the Record
of Decision, proposed rules, and schedule of public hearings was mailed to about 50,000 people. From September 14&hyph;22,
1994, a legal notice announcing the proposed rules, hearings, and inviting public comment was published in the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer, Olympia Olympian, New Paper Agency (Salt Lake City Papers), Washington Times, Lewiston Morning
Tribune, The Idaho Statesman, Wyoming Tribune, Casper Star Tribune, Bozeman Daily Chronicle, and Billings Gazette.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service held six public hearings on the proposed rules. The availability of the Record of Decision, public hearings,
and proposed rules was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on September 14, 1994 (59 FR 47112). Copies of the proposed rules were distributed to all interested parties. Public
hearings were held on September 27, 1994, in Boise, Idaho; Cheyenne, Wyoming; and Helena, Montana, and on September
29, 1994, in Salt Lake City, Utah; Washington, D.C.; and Seattle, Washington. About 90 people testified at these hearings
and about 330 people submitted written comments. Comments on the proposed rules were accepted until October 17, 1994.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In Montana, the Service has an active wolf management program due to the presence of breeding pairs of wolves. The Service's
program monitors wolves to determine their status, encourages research, provides the public with accurate information,
and controls wolves that attack domestic livestock. Wolves that depredate on livestock are translocated or removed.
Such action is required to reduce livestock losses, to foster local tolerance, and promote and enhance conservation
of wolves. The relocation of wolves under the control program is not intended to accelerate the natural expansion
of wolves into unoccupied historic habitat. Although 19 wolves have been removed under the control program, the number
of wolves has continued to expand in Montana at about 22 percent per year for the past 9 years.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reintroduction Site:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Service decided to reintroduce wolves into the Park because of the following factors. The Park is under Federal
jurisdiction, it has high-quality wolf habitat and good potential wolf release sites. It is also far from the natural
southern expansion of wolf packs from Montana. Thus, any wolf pack documented inside the Yellowstone experimental
population area would probably be from reintroduction efforts rather than from naturally dispersing extant wolf
populations in Canada or northwestern Montana. The Service will also reintroduce wolves into central Idaho as a nonessential
experimental population published under a separate rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service determined that reintroduction of wolves into the Park had the highest probability to succeed due to ecological
and political considerations (Service 1994). The reintroduction effort will enhance wolf viability by increasing
genetic diversity through genetic interchange between segments of the population. The reintroduction plan for
the Park should help in achieving wolf recovery goals 20 years sooner than under current natural recovery policy.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because reintroduced gray wolves will be classified as a nonessential experimental population, the Service's management
practices can reduce local concerns about excessive government regulation of private lands, uncontrolled livestock
depredations, excessive big game predation, and the lack of State government involvement in the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Establishment of gray wolves in the Park will initiate wolf recovery in one of the three recovery areas described as
necessary for the species recovery in the northern Rocky Mountains. No existing or anticipated Federal or State actions
identified for this release site are expected to have major effects on the experimental population. Central Idaho
is identified as the only other alternative site, and it will also receive wolves for reintroduction which will facilitate
recovery in that experimental area.

Reintroduction Protocol: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The wolf reintroduction project is undertaken by the Service in cooperation with the National Park Service, Forest
Service, other Federal agencies, potentially affected tribes, the States of Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho, and entities
of the Canadian government. To obtain wolves, the Service will enter into formal agreements with the Canadian and
Provincial governments and/or resource management agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Park's wolf reintroduction plan requires transferring 45 to 75 wolves from southwestern Canada, representing
various sex and age classes, over a 3- to 5-year period. The capture of about 15 wild wolves from several different packs
using standard capture techniques will be done annually over 3 to 5 years. Captured wolves will be transported to the
Park. Wolves from the same pack will be placed in individual holding pens of about 0.4 hectare (1 acre) for up to 2 months
for acclimation to the new environment. The acclimation pens will be isolated to protect the wolves from other animals
and to prevent habituation to humans. During the acclimation period but after release, each wolf will be monitored
by radiotelemetry to ensure quick retrieval, if necessary. Carcasses of natural prey taken in the Park will be provided
to the wolves. Veterinary care, including examinations and vaccinations, will be provided as needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once acclimated, the wolves will be released into the Park. Food (ungulate carcasses) will be provided until the wolves
no longer use it. Initially, all wolves will be closely monitored with a gradual reduction over time. Previous experiences
with reintroduced wolves have shown that they may not remain together. In general, attempts to locate and/or move
lone wolves dispersing throughout the Park will not be done. However, wolves may be moved on a case-by-case basis,
if necessary, to enhance wolf recovery in the experimental area. Reintroduced wolves will remain in the wild, as long
as they are capable of sustaining themselves on carrion or wild prey. Conflicts between wolves and humans may result
in the recapture and/or removal of a wolf in accordance with procedures successfully used with other problem wolves.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An overall assessment of the success of the reintroduction will be made after the first year and for every year thereafter.
Procedures for subsequent releases could be modified, if information from the previous reintroduction warrants
such changes. The physical reintroduction phase should be completed within 3&hyph;5 years. Once the reintroduced
wolves form two packs with each pack raising two pups, for 2 consecutive years, management practices would allow the
wolves to grow naturally toward recovery levels. Wolves would only be monitored, and no further reintroduction would
take place unless fewer than two litters were produced in a single year. This reintroduction effort is consistent
with the recovery goals identified in the 1987 recovery plan for the northern Rocky Mountain Gray Wolf. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is estimated that the Park's reintroduction effort with a similar effort in central Idaho, plus the natural recovery
occurring in northwestern Montana, could result in a viable recovered wolf population (10 breeding pairs in each
of 3 recovery areas for 3 consecutive years) by the year 2002. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service will continue to ask private landowners and agency personnel adjacent to the Park to immediately report
any wolf observations to the Service or other authorized agencies. An extensive information and education program
will discourage the taking of gray wolves by the public. Initially, all wolves will be monitored by radio telemetry
and, therefore, easy to locate if necessary. Public cooperation with the Service will be encouraged to ensure close
monitoring of the wolves and quick resolution of any conflicts that might arise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specific information on wolf reintroduction procedures can be found in Appendix 4 ``Scientific techniques for the
reintroduction of wild wolves'' in the environmental impact statement: ``The Reintroduction of Gray Wolves to Yellowstone
National Park and Central Idaho'' (Service 1994).

In accordance with section 10(j) of the Act, wolves reintroduced into the Park are designated as nonessential experimental.
Such designation allows the wolves to be treated as a threatened species or species proposed for listing for the purposes
of sections 4(d), 7, and 9 of the Act. This allows the Service to establish a less restrictive special rule rather than
using the mandatory prohibitions covering endangered species. The biological status of the wolf and the need for
management flexibility resulted in the Service designating gray wolves reintroduced into the Park as ``nonessential.''
The Service determined that the ``nonessential'' designation, with other protective measures, will conserve and
recover the gray wolf in the Yellowstone ecosystem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is anticipated that released wolves will come into contact with humans and domestic animals inside and outside
of the Park. Public opinion surveys, public comments on wolf management planning, and the positions taken by elected
local, State, and Federal government officials indicate that wolves should not be reintroduced without assurances
that current uses of public and private lands will not be disrupted by wolf recovery activities. The following provisions
respond to these concerns. There would be no violation of the Act for unintentional, nonnegligent, and accidental
taking of wolves by the public, provided the take was incidental to otherwise lawful activities, it did not result
from negligent conduct lacking reasonable due care or was in defense of human life. Such wolf takings would need to
be reported to the Service or other authorized agency within 24 hours. The Service may designate certain Federal,
State, and/or tribal employees to take wolves that required special care or pose a threat to livestock or property.
Private land owners or their designates would be permitted to harass wolves in an opportunistic noninjurious manner
on their leases or private property, provided such harassment was reported within 7 days to the Service or other authorized
agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the ``nonessential'' status, private landowners or their designates would be permitted to take (injure or
kill) a wolf in the act of wounding or killing livestock on private land. However, physical evidence (wounded or dead
livestock) of such an attack would be required to document that the attack occurred simultaneously with the taking.
A report of such a take would need to be immediately (within 24 hours) reported to the Service or other authorized agency
personnel for investigation. Once six or more breeding pairs are established in the Park or experimental area, livestock
owners or their designates could receive a permit from a Service-designated agency to take (injure or kill) gray wolves
that are attacking livestock on permitted public livestock grazing allotments. Such a take would be only permitted
after due notification to Service-designated agencies and unsuccessful capture efforts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wolves that repeatedly (two times in a calendar year) attack domestic animals other than livestock (fowl, swine,
goats, etc.) or pets (dogs or cats) on private land would be designated as problem wolves and relocated from the area
by the Service or a designated agency. After one relocation, wolves that continued to depredate on domestic animals
would be considered chronic problem wolves and would be removed from the wild. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is unlikely that wolf predation on big game populations would be primary cause for failure of the States or tribes
to meet their specific big game management objectives outside of the national parks and national wildlife refuges.
The Service could, however, determine that wolves responsible for excessive depredation should be translocated
to other sites in the experimental area. Such actions are expected to be rare and unlikely to impact the overall recovery
rate. States and tribes would need to define such situations in their Service-approved wolf management plans before
such actions could be taken. Under the nonessential designation, wolves could not be deliberately killed solely
to resolve predation conflicts with big game. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The States of Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho and potentially affected tribes will be encouraged to enter into cooperative
agreements for management of the gray wolf outside of national parks and national wildlife refuges. These cooperative
agreements would be reviewed annually by the Service to ensure that the States and tribes have adequate regulatory
authority to conserve listed species, including the gray wolf. The National Park Service will be the primary agency
implementing the experimental population rule inside the boundaries of national parks. States and tribes are anticipated
to be the primary agencies implementing this experimental population rule outside of national parks and national
wildlife refuges after their wolf management plans are approved by the Service. The Service will provide oversight,
coordinate wolf recovery activities, and provide technical assistance. If the States and tribes do not assume wolf
management responsibilities or adhere to provisions of their wolf management plans, the Service would assume management
authority. If for unforeseen reasons the wolf population failed to sustain positive growth toward recovery levels
for 2 consecutive years, the influencing factors would be identified. The Service, and affected States or tribes
would be responsible for determining if any management strategies needed modification. The Service in coordination
with the States and tribes would implement those strategies to ensure wolf population recovery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service finds that protective measures and management practices are necessary and advisable for the conservation
and recovery of the gray wolf and that no additional Federal regulations are required. The Service also finds that
the nonessential experimental status is appropriate for gray wolves taken from wild populations and released in
the Park. The nonessential status for such wolves allows for additional management flexibility. Nonessential experimental
populations located outside of a national park or national wildlife refuge are treated under the Act as if they were
only proposed for listing, and not listed. Only section 7(a)(1) and section 7(a)(4) apply to Federal actions outside
national parks and wildlife refuges. Presently, there are no conflicts envisioned with any current or anticipated
management actions of the Forest Service or other Federal agencies in the areas. The national forests are beneficial
to the reintroduction effort in that they form a natural buffer to private properties and are typically managed to
produce wild animals that wolves could prey upon. The Service finds the less restrictive section 7 requirements associated
with the nonessential designation do not pose a threat to the recovery effort and continued existence of the gray wolf.

The full provisions of section 7 apply to nonessential experimental populations in a national park or national wildlife
refuge. Consequently, the Service, National Park Service, Forest Service, or any other Federal agency is prohibited
from authorizing, funding, or carrying out an action within a national park or national wildlife refuge that is likely
to jeopardize the continued existence of the gray wolf. Pursuant to 50 CFR 17.83(b), section 7 determinations must
consider all experimental and nonexperimental wolves as a listed species for analysis purposes in national parks.
The Service has reviewed all ongoing and proposed uses of the parks and refuges and determined that none are likely
to jeopardize the continued existence of the gray wolf, nor will they adversely affect the success of the reintroduction
program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most of the reintroduction area is remote and sparsely inhabited wild lands. However, there are some risks to wolf
recovery associated with take of wolves in regard to other land uses and various recreational activities. Potential
threats are hunting, trapping, animal damage control activities, and high speed vehicular traffic. Hunting, trapping,
and USDA Animal Damage Control programs are prohibited or strictly regulated in national parks, as well as closely
regulated by State and Federal law and policy. There are very few paved or unpaved roads in the proposed reintroduction
area or immediately outside of it. The unpaved roads typically have low vehicle traffic, are constructed for low speeds
and used only seasonally. Thus, wolves should encounter vehicles infrequently. In accordance with existing labeling,
the use of toxicants lethal to wolves in areas occupied by wolves is prohibited. Overall, the possible risks and threats
that could impact the success of the reintroduction effort are thought to be minimal.

The release site for reintroducing wolves will be in Yellowstone National Park. The designated experimental population
area will include the State of Wyoming; that portion of Idaho east of Interstate Highway 15; and the State of Montana
east of Interstate Highway 15 and south of the Missouri River east of Great Falls, Montana, to the Montana/North Dakota
border.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To date, the experimental population area does not currently support any reproducing pairs of wolves. It is also unlikely
that wolves from the natural southern expansion from northwestern Montana have arrived in the Park. Except for the
gray wolves in northwestern Montana, only an occasional, isolated wolf has been reported, killed, or otherwise documented
in Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, or other Western States. Single packs have been reported throughout the northern Rocky
Mountains. However, these reported wolves or groups of wolves, if factual, apparently disappeared for unknown reasons
and did not establish recoverable ``populations'' as defined by wolf experts. A wolf population is defined as at least
two breeding pairs of gray wolves that each successfully raise at least two young to December 31 of their birth year
for 2 consecutive years (Service 1994). Thus, the Service has determined that there is no population of wolves in the
Park and therefore, the Park reintroduction is consistent with provisions of section 10(j) of the Act; specifically,
that experimental wolves need to be geographically separate from other nonexperimental populations. It is possible
that prior to 2002, other wolves may appear in the wild and be attracted to the experimental area occupied by the reintroduced
wolves. Any ``new'' arrivals would be classified as part of the experimental population. These wolves could assist
in the recovery and expansion of the experimental population to where wolves could be dispersing into central Idaho
and Montana.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wolves dispersing into areas in Idaho and Montana, outside of the experimental area, would continue to receive endangered
species protection under the Act, as did the wolves that recolonized an area near Glacier National Park in 1982. It
is also possible, but not probable, that during the next 3 years wolves could move between recovery areas and enhance
the genetic diversity between natural recovery areas and reintroduction sites. It is not anticipated that such exchange
will significantly alter the recovery rate in the Park's experimental population area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Service determined that there is no existing wolf population in the recovery area that would preclude
reintroduction and establishment of an experimental population in the Park, the Service will continue to determine
the presence of any wild wolves. Prior to any reintroduction, the Service would evaluate the status of any wolves found
in the experimental population area. If a wolf population is discovered in the proposed experimental area, no reintroduction
of wolves would occur. Instead, the success of the naturally occurring wolf population would be monitored to determine
if recovery was continuing. If a natural wolf population is located in the experimental area prior to the effective
date of the final rule, then the final rule would not be implemented and there would be no reintroduction program. Wolves
naturally occurring would be endangered and managed as such, with full protection under the Act. If the natural wolf
population failed to maintain positive growth for two consecutive years, then the reintroduction effort could proceed
or other recovery measures taken. After reintroduction is completed, according to the Reintroduction Protocol
(section 5 above), management of the experimental population will begin.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once this rule is effective and wolves have been released into the recovery area, the rule would remain in effect until
wolf recovery occurs or a scientific review indicates that modifications in the experimental rule are necessary
to achieve wolf recovery.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a wolf population is discovered in the Park's recovery area, after the effective date of the experimental population
rule but before release, reintroduction under the rule would not occur in that area and any such wolves would be managed
as a natural recovering population. Boundaries of the proposed experimental population area would be changed, as
needed, to encourage recovery of the naturally occurring, breeding wolf population. No experimental population
area will contain a portion of the home range of any active breeding pairs of wolves that have successfully raised young,
prior to the establishment of the experimental area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management of the nonessential experimental wolf population would allow reintroduced wolves to be killed or moved
by Service authorized Federal, State, and tribal agencies for domestic animal depredations and excessive predation
on big game populations. Under special conditions, the public could harass or kill wolves attacking livestock (cattle,
sheep, horses, and mules). There would be no Federal compensation program, but compensation from existing private
funding sources would be encouraged. When six or more wolf packs are documented in the experimental population area
outside of the national parks and national wildlife refuges, there would be no land-use restrictions, including
areas around den sites or other critical areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wolves have a relatively high reproductive rate. Projected recruitment would off-set the anticipated 10 percent
mortality resulting from management control actions. An additional 10 percent loss could occur from other mortality
sources. Once reintroduced wolves reach the goal of six wolf packs, the reproductive output of the packs would provide
a population increase at or near 22 percent per year. Closely regulated public control (taking of depredating wolves)
would effectively focus on only individual problem wolves. Agency control actions would more likely target groups
of wolves containing problem individuals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service, and States or tribes as authorized, could move wolves that are negatively impacting ungulate populations.
Such wolves would be moved to other places within the experimental population area. Two examples when this would occur
are (1) when wolf predation is dramatically affecting prey availability because of unusual habitat or weather conditions
(e.g., bighorn sheep in areas with marginal escape habitat) and (2) when wolves cause prey to move onto private property
and mix with livestock, increasing potential conflicts. The States and tribes will define such unacceptable impacts,
how they would be measured, and identify other possible mitigation in their State or tribal management plans which
are to be approved by the Service through cooperative agreement before such control actions are conducted. Wolves
will not be deliberately killed solely to address ungulate-wolf conflicts. Control actions by the States or tribes
likely to be significant or beyond the provisions of the experimental rule as determined by the Service would have
to be specifically incorporated into an amendment of this experimental rule and subject to national public comment
and review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management of wolves in the experimental population would not cause major changes to existing private or public land-use
restrictions (except at containment facilities during reintroduction) after six breeding pairs of wolves are established
in this experimental area. When five or fewer breeding pairs are in the experimental area, land-use restrictions
could be used, as needed, to control intrusive human disturbance on public lands. Their implementation would be at
the discretion of land management and natural resources agencies. Before five or fewer breeding wolf pairs are established,
temporary restrictions on human access near active wolf den sites may be required between April 1 and June 30. Any restrictions
on private land would only occur with complete landowner cooperation and concurrence.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service, and Federal, State, or tribal agencies, after they have been authorized by the Service, could promptly
remove any wolf from the experimental population once the Service, or its authorized agencies, has determined it
was presenting a threat to human life or safety. Although not a management option 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
per se, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
it is noted that a person can legally kill or injure wolves in response to an immediate threat to human life. The incidental,
unavoidable, unintentional, accidental take in the course of otherwise lawful activity, or in defense of human life,
would be permitted by the Service and its authorized agencies, provided that such taking was not resulting from negligent
conduct lacking reasonable due care, due care was exercised to avoid taking a wolf, and the taking was immediately
(within 24 hours) reported to the appropriate authorities. Shooters have the responsibility to identify their target
before shooting. The act of taking a wolf that is wrongly identified as another species, for purposes of this rule,
will be considered as intentional, negligent, and not accidental. Such take may be referred to the appropriate authorities
for prosecution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service, and other Federal, State, or tribal agencies, after they have been designated by the Service, may control
wolves that attack livestock (cattle, sheep, horses, and mules) by aversive conditioning, nonlethal control, and/or
moving wolves when five or fewer breeding pairs are established, or by other previously described measures. Killing
wolves or placing them in captivity may only be considered when there are six or more breeding pairs established in
the experimental population area. When depredation occurs on public land and prior to the establishment of six breeding
pairs, depredating females and their pups would be captured and released, at or near the site of capture, one time prior
to October 1. If depredations continue, or if six packs are present, females and their pups would be removed. Wolves
on private land under these same circumstances would be moved. Wolves that attack other domestic animals or pets on
private land twice in a calendar year would be moved, and chronic problem wolves would be removed from the wild.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service, other Federal agencies, and State or tribal wildlife personnel would be authorized and trained to take
wolves under special circumstances. Wolves could be live-captured and translocated to resolve conflicts with State
or tribal big-game management objectives, when they are located outside of the experimental areas, or to enhance
wolf recovery. If the captured animal is clearly unfit to remain in the wild, it could be placed in a captive facility.
Killing of any wolves would be a last resort and only authorized when live capture attempts fail or there is some clear
danger to human life.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service and authorized agencies of the Service would use the following conditions and criteria to determine the
status of problem wolves within the nonessential experimental population area:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Wounded livestock or the partial remains of a livestock carcass must be presented with clear evidence (Roy and
Dorrance 1976; Fritts 1982) that the livestock injury or death was directly caused by a wolf or wolves. Such evidence
is essential for justifying any control action because wolves may feed on carrion they did not kill. Additionally,
there must be an indication that additional livestock losses may occur if the problem wolf or wolves are not controlled.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) No evidence of artificial or intentional feeding of wolves can be present. Improperly disposed livestock carcasses
located in the area of depredation will be considered attractants. On Federal lands, removal or a decision on the use
of such attractants must accompany any control action. If livestock carrion or carcasses are not being used as bait
for an authorized control action on Federal lands, it must be removed or otherwise disposed of so that they will not
attract wolves.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) On Federal lands, animal husbandry practices previously identified in existing approved allotment plans and
annual operating plans for allotments must have been followed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal responsibility for protecting gray wolves under the experimental population provisions of the Act would
continue until formal delisting rulemaking procedures are completed. In accordance with the Act, delisting may
occur when analysis of the best available scientific and commercial information shows that gray wolves are no longer
threatened with extinction due to: (1) Loss of habitat, (2) overutilization, (3) disease or predation, (4) inadequacy
of existing regulatory mechanisms, and (5) other natural or manmade factors. In addition to the above, the following
criteria must be met: (1) For 3 consecutive years, a minimum of 10 breeding pairs are documented in each of the 3 recovery
areas described in the revised wolf recovery plan (Service 1987); (2) protective legal mechanisms are in place; and
(3) the EIS evaluation has been completed (Service 1994). After delisting, the Act specifies a species population
must be monitored for a 5-year period. After delisting, if in any 1 of the 3 recovery areas the wolf population fell below
the minimum of 10 breeding pairs for 2 consecutive years, then wolves in that recovery area would be considered for
protective status under the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All reintroduced wolves designated as nonessential experimental will be removed from the wild and the experimental
status and regulations revoked when (1) legal actions or lawsuits change the wolves status to endangered under the
Act or (2) within 90 days of the initial release date, naturally occurring wolves, consisting of two breeding pairs
that for 2 consecutive years have each successfully raised two offspring, are discovered in the experimental population
area. The naturally occurring wolves would be managed and protected as endangered species under the Act.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 16, 1994 (59 FR 42108 and 59 FR 42118, respectively) (Service 1994a). The Record of Decision, notification
of the proposed rules, and tentative schedule for public hearings were mailed to nearly 50,000 people on September
6, 1994. All interested parties were requested to submit factual reports or information that might contribute to
the development of the final rule. Appropriate Federal and State agencies, county governments, scientific organizations,
and other interested parties were contacted and requested to comment. A legal notice announcing the proposed rules,
hearings, and inviting public comment were published in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Olympia Olympian, New
Paper Agency (Salt Lake City Papers), Washington Times, Lewiston Morning Tribune, The Idaho Statesman, Wyoming
Tribune, Casper Star Tribune, Bozeman Daily Chronicle, and Billings Gazette beginning on September 14, 1994.

The Service held six public hearings on the proposed rules. A notification of the hearings and availability of the
Record of Decision and proposed rules was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on September 14, 1994 (59 FR 47112). Copies of the proposed rules were distributed to all interested parties. Public
hearings were held on September 27, 1994, in Boise, Idaho; Cheyenne, Wyoming; and Helena, Montana, and on September
29, 1994, in Salt Lake City, Utah; Washington, D.C.; and Seattle, Washington. About 90 people testified at these hearings
and about 330 people submitted written comments. Comment on the proposed rules was accepted until October 17, 1994.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A total of 426 written and oral responses, representing 621 signatures, were received during the proposed rule 34-day
comment period. Several letters, including letters from the Governor of the State of Wyoming and the Colorado Wool
Growers Association, were received after comment period closed. However, these letters were reviewed and considered.
From October 17 to 24, 1994, a specialized interagency team analyzed the public comments. After October 31, 1994,
the team's report was distributed to agency cooperators and to anyone requesting it (Service 1994c). In addition
to the public comments, three Notices of Intent to Sue were received. The Service has completed its review and consideration
of all written and oral comments. All of the issues raised by the public on the proposed rules were previously identified
and addressed in the final EIS. Analysis of the comments revealed 25 issues which are identified and discussed below.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Changes in final rule as a result of public comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following minor changes and clarifications were made to the final rule or to discussions of the final rule based
on public comments on the proposed rule. These individual or cumulative changes do not alter the predicted impact
or effect of the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Several conditions on when wolves may be harassed or taken were removed from the final rule. The following conditions
are not part of the final rule: (1) Distinction between adult wolves and pups, and (2) harassment may only occur for
15 minutes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. In the background discussion of the final rule, it was clarified that after a private individual takes a depredating
wolf, no additional agency actions will be conducted to control problem wolves in an area, unless more livestock depredations
occur. This assumes that the problem wolf was killed, and therefore, no other control actions are required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Several terms in the final rule were clarified and defined, including: ``opportunistic noninjurious harassment,''
``unintentional take,'' ``disposal of livestock carrion,'' issuance criteria for a wolf take permit to a grazing
lessee on public lands, and criteria for resolving wolf/ungulate conflicts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. A termination clause was added to the final rule. The clause clarifies the Service's role and responsibilities
regarding the establishment of an experimental population. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Three years following the initial reintroduction of wolves, a thorough review will be conducted. The review will
determine if further reintroductions are required and if, to date, the management program has been successful. A
provision to the rule was added that if the reintroduction and management practices under the experimental population
rule did not result in wolf recovery, the Service would take appropriate actions. Such actions would be caused by the
failure of the wolf population to maintain positive growth for 2 consecutive years. All corrective actions would
be coordinated with affected States, tribes, and other Federal agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Language regarding scientific or technical decisions in the background discussion of the rule was changed. Study
design and reintroduction techniques may be changed or modified when expert and skilled biologists determine such
changes are necessary and prudent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A list of relevant issues based on public comments and the Service's response to those issues follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Issue 1: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The subspecies of wolf that occupied the Yellowstone area was 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Canis lupus irremotus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The reintroduction program will use wolves from Canada which were once classified as a different subspecies; therefore,
this violates the experimental population provision of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Service Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In recent times, there have been several revisions to the taxonomic classification of wolves in North America. Several
scientific investigations have dealt with this issue (Brewster and Fritts 1994, Nowak 1994, Wayne et al. 1994). These
investigations concluded (1) there were fewer wolf subspecies than previously believed, (2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
irremotus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 was not a distinct subspecies, and (3) that wolves might be better classified as types or representative groups of
geographic or climatic conditions rather than distinct subspecies. The northern Rocky Mountains are within the
historic range of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Canis lupus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Investigators conclude that reintroduction of wolves from Canada to the Park or central Idaho would accelerate
the ongoing natural southern expansion of the species. Additionally, it was determined that current taxonomic discussions
of wolf subspecies should not affect wolf recovery efforts in the northern Rocky Mountains of the United States.

Issue 2: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendment to section 10(j) of the Act states that experimental populations may only be designated when there is
geographical separation between the experimental population and other existing populations of the species. The
occasional occurrence of lone wolves in the areas of central Idaho and Yellowstone would prohibit the use of the experimental
population designation since there would be no geographic separation between natural occurring and experimental
wolves. Comments also stated that the boundaries of the experimental areas should be adjusted or the reintroduction
program should be delayed, particularly, in central Idaho due to the presence of naturally occurring wolves.

For many years, the Service and other agencies have tried to document wolf activity in Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming
(Service 1994a Appendix 12). Since the 1970's, wolf observations particularly from Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho,
have been reported. However, to date the only documented breeding groups of wolves are in northwestern Montana. Based
on scientific inquiry, the Service defines a wolf population as at least two breeding pairs of wild wolves each successfully
raising at least two young each year, for 2 consecutive years, and that a population is composed of breeding groups
of wolves (Service 1994a, Appendix 9). Presently, there are no known breeding pairs of wolves within the experimental
area. Nor does the experimental area contain any portions of home ranges of any breeding pairs of wolves. The Service
finds that there is no geographic overlap between any Montana wolf population home range and the experimental area.
The northern boundary of the Idaho experimental population area was moved further south because, in 1990 and 1992,
there were a few instances when an active breeding group of wolves from Montana were located south of the experimental
boundary recommended in the proposed rule. The rulemaking language now allows revocation of this rule and removal
of all reintroduced wolves, if within 90 days after the initial reintroduction a naturally occurring wolf population
is discovered in the experimental area. Any naturally occurring wolves will be managed as endangered species under
the Act and afforded the same terms and conditions as wolves in Montana. The Service has had a wolf monitoring program
in place in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming for over two years. This system is designed to accept reports from anyone, and
when a report focuses on a particular area a wolf biologist investigates to verify the presence or absence of wolves.
Through this method the Service has identified newly formed packs in northwestern Montana. Within the experimental
area, no confirmation of wolves from provided reports has occurred.

(Service 1994a). Professional wildlife biologists and scientific organizations complimented the Service on the

For the past 20 years and presently, the Service and others have searched for wolves in the northern Rocky Mountains.
Reviews of correspondence from the past 25 years show the longstanding and widespread view that wolves already occupied
Idaho and the discovery of their presence imminent. Very extensive monitoring within the experimental population
area has not confirmed the presence of wolves. This particular species is not habitat limited and if allowed to get
into the experimental area would reproduce and survive. The translocation of wild wolves from Canada to the Park will
provide the opportunity to start a wolf population. This translocation effort will greatly facilitate recovery
of the gray wolf in the Yellowstone ecosystem. The 1987 Rocky Mountain wolf recovery plan recommended an additional
5 years of monitoring for natural wolf recovery in Idaho. However, the recovery plan provided other options if two
breeding pairs of wolves had not become established in Idaho during the 5 years. Because no breeding pairs have been
located, the draft and final EIS and Record of Decision allow the simultaneous reintroduction of wolves into central
Idaho and the Park in an effort to ensure the viability and conservation of wolves in the Rocky Mountains (Service 1994a,
Appendix 16).

The Service proposed a very liberal experimental rule to accommodate concerns of local residents and the affected

The Service believes that, as proposed, reintroduction and management techniques will result in wolf population
recovery and delisting by about 2002. Rulemaking language was added clarifying that take activities must lead to
eventual recovery of the wolf. Additionally, if there is no progress in achieving wolf population recovery (i.e.,
if wolves in a recovery area do not exhibit positive growth for 2 consecutive years), then factors impacting population
growth will be investigated. Information from the investigation will be made available to the public and appropriate
Federal, State, and tribal agencies. Within a year, the agencies may recommend and implement new management actions
or modifications to their wolf management plans to correct factors negatively impacting wolf recovery. Only as a
last resort would changes or modifications to sections of the experimental rule be made.

 The proposed rules' requirements that ``only adult wolves (greater than 50 pounds) can be harassed'' and then ``only
for 15 minutes'' and ``only adult wolves that are witnessed attacking livestock on private land can be killed by private
parties'' are overly restrictive. The provision that wolves can only be killed under a special permit when (1) seen
attacking livestock for the third time on Federal lands, (2) six or more wolf packs are present in the experimental
population, and (3) all agency control efforts have failed, does not address the issues in a timely or efficient manner.
The implication that land-use restrictions may be employed on private lands when five or fewer wolf packs are present
in the experimental area also needs clarification.

 The Service agrees and has eliminated (1) the distinction between adult wolves and pups for both noninjurious harassment
and take and (2) the length of time wolves may be harassed (as long as physical injury is not incurred). Permittees with
grazing rights on public land can readily obtain a written take permit for wolves seen attacking livestock. However,
issuance criteria still require that prior to issuing the 45-day take permit (1) six or more wolf packs must be present
in the experimental population area, (2) authorized agencies must confirm that a wolf caused the livestock injury
or death, and (3) other agency control actions have failed to resolve the problem. The final rule also clarifies that
no land-use restrictions will be exercised by Federal agencies on private land at any time.

 The Service added or clarified definitions and/or language in the final rule. However, the wolf reintroduction program
is complex and has many unforeseen variables. It is impossible to imagine or describe in detail every situation that
might arise during its implementation. Some situations can only be accurately addressed on a case-by-case basis
and judged by their particular circumstances. It is the intent of the Service to use the experimental rule to aid the
conservation, recovery, and eventual delisting of wolf populations in the northern Rocky Mountains of the United
States. The Service in cooperation with other Federal, State, and tribal agencies will use the flexibility of the
experimental rule to address local concerns and unforeseen situations. The professional expertise and experience
of wildlife managers will facilitate the implementation and any modifications needed to improve the wolf reintroduction
program. Additional language was added to the rule, clarifying that management flexibility is required as the program
is implemented and refined.

 To date, the Federal government has funded the participation of affected States and tribes in regard to wolf restoration
program. The Service plans to continue its funding commitment with Congressional appropriations until wolves are
delisted. The public stated its concern over the use of taxpayer dollars and the need for government to wisely spend
tax dollars. The Service, therefore, must keep expenses for wolf reintroduction as low as possible while maintaining
an effective program. The Service will encourage the States and tribes to submit reasonable budgets for wolf management
programs, as well as search for ways to pool and coordinate resources so that overall costs are reduced. It is the legal
responsibility of the Service to monitor the progress and adherence of State and tribal agencies to their management
plans. The Service will ensure and work cooperatively with others to meet the stated recovery goals.

 In Montana, the Defenders of Wildlife implemented a private livestock compensation program. Because the Defenders
Program has been successful, it was expanded to include Idaho and Wyoming. The Service will not directly fund a livestock
compensation program. The Service will encourage livestock producers to utilize private compensation programs
when depredation occurs. The Service and USDA Animal Damage Control will aid livestock producers by maintaining
an effective control program that minimizes livestock losses due to wolves. The rule addresses the concerns of private
property owners by (1) providing an effective control program, (2) allowing landowners to take wolves on their private
land when justified, and (3) invoking no land-use restrictions on private land. The Service has reviewed the constitutionality
of this rule in regard to protected private property rights. The review concludes the Service's actions do not violate
the private property rights of individuals (Service 1994a, Appendix 6).

 It is well documented that the Service made an extraordinary effort to involve the public and other government entities
in developing management practices and the experimental population rules regarding the wolf reintroduction program.
During the past 3 years, the Service held over 100 meetings, open houses, and hearings. The Service distributed over
750,000 documents and reviewed and considered nearly 170,000 public comments during development of the rule. Federal
agencies and affected States and tribes were active participants during the process. This final rule represents
the participatory work and consensus of affected agencies and others interested or impacted by the rulemaking.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Service is confident in the States' and tribes' ability to evaluate the impact wolf predation may have on ungulate
populations and, when appropriate, implement corrective management actions. An evaluation of possible impacts
and/or actions in regard to a specific ungulate species and location is best accomplished by biologists most familiar
with the situation. The Service, States, and tribes will coordinate wolf management plans to ensure that State and
tribal interests in native ungulate management are met while meeting the Service's mandate for wolf recovery. Rulemaking
language was added to the section on how States and tribes will manage ungulate/wolf conflicts. States and tribes
are required to prepare acceptable management plans for approval by the Service. It is expected that since these management
plans may affect State wildlife management programs, the States will go through a public review process as part of
their development. Such plans will indicate the point at which wolf/ungulate conflicts become so critical that corrective
action must be taken. A decision to translocate wolves to reduce such conflicts must serve to enhance, or at a minimum
not inhibit, wolf recovery.

 The timeframes for a person to report the harassing (7 days) and/or the unintentional taking (24 hours) of wolves were
not changed. The harassing or taking of a wolf is a critical and potentially serious event. A person who harasses a wolf
is best served by reporting the incident as soon as possible so agency management actions can be implemented, if necessary.
Submission of a report on wolf harassment provides a record which can document the continuation of suspected or actual
livestock depredations or rationale for taking a wolf. The immediate reporting of livestock depredation by a wolf
also allows the immediate investigation of the incident and gathering of fresh evidence. In Montana, agency professionals
who investigate livestock depredations are readily accessible during the night, weekends, and holidays. During
the past 9 years in Montana, the reporting, documenting, and resolution of livestock depredations have not been significant
issues. Therefore, they are not anticipated to be a problem for wolf reintroductions into the experimental population
areas. The United States legal system often takes into account unusual mitigating circumstances, such as the remoteness
of a livestock allotment interfering with an individual being able to report an incident as required by regulation.
The Service could determine that an incident would not be referred for prosecution, when a person failed to meet the
reporting requirements and could justify their action.

 In accordance with the Act, delisting may occur when analysis of the best available scientific and commercial information
shows that gray wolves are no longer threatened with extinction due to: (1) Loss of habitat, (2) overutilization,
(3) disease or predation, (4) inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms, and (5) other natural or manmade factors.
In addition to the above, the final EIS, states that the following criteria must be met: (1) For 3 consecutive years,
a minimum of 10 breeding pairs are documented in each of the 3 recovery areas described in the revised wolf recovery
plan (Service 1987); (2) protective legal mechanisms are in place; and (3) the EIS evaluation has been completed (Service
1994). After delisting, the Act specifies a species population must be monitored for a 5-year period. After delisting,
if in any 1 of the 3 recovery areas the wolf population fell below the minimum of 10 breeding pairs for 2 consecutive years,
then wolves in that recovery area would be considered for protective status under the Act. Delisting procedures have
been discussed (Service 1994a, Appendix 11). Endangered wolves in northwestern Montana can be downlisted to threatened
once 10 breeding pairs are documented for 3 consecutive years. Experimental populations of wolves cannot be downlisted
because their protective status is based on the experimental population rule. Experimental population rules can
be withdrawn when wolf numbers have reached recovery levels, no further protection under the Act is required, and
the wolf is delisted.

The Service prepared and published an intra-Service evaluation of its proposed action in the draft and final EIS (Service

would not adversely impact other endangered or threatened species. In November 1994, Service field offices in Idaho,
Montana, and Wyoming reviewed the proposed rules and came to the same conclusion. The Service finds that the impact
of the final rules, like the predicated impact reviewed of the proposed rules, will not adversely affect other protected

The hybridization of wolves with other canids may occur; however, it is not a significant problem anywhere in North
America where ranges of wolves, domestic dogs, coyotes, and foxes overlap (Service 1994a, Chapter 1). Thus, it is
not anticipated to be a problem in the northern Rocky Mountains. The rules state the Service or other authorized agencies
may remove reintroduced wolves that breed with domestic dogs, coyotes, or foxes, or their hybrid-offspring. Individual
animals that agency biologists suspect to be domesticated wolves or wild wolf/other canid species hybrids would
be removed from the wild after examination of the canid's physical or behavioral characteristics.

It is documented that individual wolves may disperse over 500 miles. However, for the past 10 years, there has been
no evidence of naturally occurring wolves dispersing to and producing a viable wolf population in the central Idaho
or Yellowstone areas. After the effective date of the experimental population rules, any such wolves and their offspring
would be treated as experimental population animals. From a practical wildlife management perspective, the Service
cannot be expected to determine if an individual wolf had naturally dispersed into the area or been reintroduced.
The initial reintroduced animals will be radio collared and differentiated. Once they have reproduced it would be
impossible to determine if the wolf was a wild dispersing animal or progeny of experimental wolves. The rule as written
helps avoid the possible conflict. Such a distinction, therefore, cannot be treated separately by regulation. Undoubtedly,
the establishment of a viable wolf population and recovery of the species will be enhanced by the reintroduction of
30 wolves annually for the next 3&hyph;5 years. The presence of reintroduced wolves may increase the probability
of naturally dispersing wolves from northwestern Montana or Canada to move into, stay, and reproduce in an experimental
area. While this event would contribute to population recovery, it would not greatly impact the overall population
growth rate since the majority of breeding wolves would be reintroduced animals.

Wolves are adaptable to a wide variety of human activities, except for deliberate killing. Experiences in North America
indicate that human disturbance, even around active den sites, is not a significant factor affecting wolf survival
or population growth (Service 1994a, Appendix 13). The rule protects active wolf dens during the earliest stages
of wolf recovery, if necessary. Killing wolves is illegal except for a very few limited exceptions. The rule allows
flexibility to reconsider land use restrictions if wolf populations do not grow toward recovery levels. Wolves in
Montana have not needed land-use restrictions and, at this time, land-use restrictions do not appear necessary for
wolf populations to recover in Idaho or Wyoming.

The opportunity for private individuals to kill wolves in the experimental population areas is limited to when wolves
are actually in the act of killing livestock. The Service has determined that wolves that exhibit this behavior do
not further conservation of the species and for that reason are currently controlled (Service 1988). The selective
removal of this type of individual by the public is warranted in certain limited circumstances and their removal contributes
to conservation of the species. Agency control would be initiated anyway and, under tight regulation, public control
can be more likely to remove the specific problem individual than agency control actions. If a wolf is taken in the act
of depredating, further agency control would not be conducted unless additional depredations occur. This limited
taking of wolves by the private sector could reduce the total number of wolves that might be taken in response to livestock
depredations and reduces the opportunity for other wolves to feed on or learn to depredate on livestock.

As stated in the Service's EIS, in the proposed rule, and in the final rule, removal of wolves from Canadian populations
would not significantly impact those populations (59 FR 42110); the likelihood that wolf populations would become
permanently established and grow to recovery level is extremely high (59 FR 42111); reintroduction would greatly
accelerate wolf population recovery, enhance wolf population viability, and lead to subsequent delisting (59 FR
42110); and the reintroduced wolves and subsequent population that developed would not be affected by existing or
anticipated Federal or State actions or private activities within or adjacent to the experimental population area
(59 FR 42112), therefore, the release of the experimental wolves would further the conservation of the species (Service
1994a, Service 1994b).

The rule clarifies that while the States and Tribes are encouraged to lead implementation of the experimental rule,
the Service will monitor and is ultimately responsible for the recovery of the species. Should progress toward wolf
recovery not be evident (two years of no growth would trigger other conservation measures), the Service will cooperate
with the states and tribes to assure steps are taken to resume progress toward recovery. The states and tribes already
have highly professional wildlife management programs in place and their expertise, authorities, knowledge, and
organizations can greatly enhance recovery of the species. Animal Damage Control is a professional federal wildlife
management agency that has the responsibility, like all federal agencies, to use their authorities to enhance the
recovery of listed species. Animal Damage Control has been a valuable and necessary component of wolf recovery activities
in Montana and Minnesota.

The measure of success in the wolf recovery program is not the level of wolf population mortality but growth of the wolf
population. Wolf populations can withstand varying levels of mortality and individual wolf mortality is very difficult
to measure accurately. Language was added to the final rule that clarifies the need to modify the state and tribal plans,
which must be in compliance with the rule, if wolf population growth is not evident. Wolf population growth is easier
to accurately monitor and is the criteria that is used to implement other provisions in the rule (e.g. when lethal control
may be used, when a population is established, when reintroductions stop, and when wolf populations are recovered).
A ``put and take'' strategy does not address the problem of a wolf population failing to maintain growth and is an expensive
process to conduct. It is more productive to identify the factors preventing wolf population growth and correct them
before simply continually adding more wolves that may die from the same causes. A population that required constant
reintroductions to compensate for excessive mortality rates could not be delisted.

The Service determined the boundaries of the experimental populations based upon the distribution of the wolf population
in Montana. The experimental population boundaries do not include any portion of any known area used by breeding wolves
in Montana. It was also determined that any wolf population inside the experimental boundaries would most likely
be the result of reintroduced wolves and any breeding groups of wolves outside the experimental boundaries would
likely be the result of natural dispersal of wolves from northwestern Montana or Canadian populations. The definition
of a wolf population underwent scientific peer review (Service 1994a, Appendix 8). The rationale and location of
the experimental population boundaries were also reviewed, and no better consensus of a way to define the geographic
range of a wolf population was brought to the Service's attention.

Once a wolf population is established in an experimental area there is no need to conduct further reintroductions
and to do so would not be cost effective. The soonest the ``wolf population'' criteria could be met is in three years.
At that time about 45 wolves would have been reintroduced to each area, assuring substantial genetic diversity, and
10&hyph;20 pups should be born annually.

What does legally present livestock mean? Who is responsible for determining livestock husbandry practices?

Service Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The provisions on legally present livestock are part of the rule so that control of problem wolves will occur only when
livestock are present on public land in a manner already allowed by conditions in their federal, state, or tribal grazing
permit. No new conditions are expected because of wolf reintroduction. Control of wolves that attack livestock should
not be expected when livestock are illegally present on federal lands. Proper livestock husbandry practices means
the current community standards and practices used by livestock producers as already determined by the land management
agency issuing the permit. No changes from the standard livestock grazing practices already being used on federal
grazing leases are envisioned. Wolf management in Montana has not affected livestock management practices on public
lands and would likely not affect those practices in other areas. Issues like proper disposal of livestock carrion
are already being addressed in the Yellowstone area because of other concerns such as grizzly bear recovery. Language
in the final rule reflects that carrion must be managed in such a way as not to present a continuing attractant to wolves
if problems occur, but leaves the livestock producer and land management agency to determine how best to address potential
problems.

 The Service has reviewed public concern about the accuracy of its early responses to issues raised in the draft and
final EIS and which were also raised by persons commenting on the proposed rule. At this time, the information provided
during the public comment period on the proposed rule does not provide sufficient data or cause for the Service to significantly
change any of its earlier findings which were published in the final EIS regarding the issues of: Amending the Endangered
Species Act, wolves as a missing component of the ecosystem, humane treatment of wolves, enjoying wolves, regulated
public take, cost of the program, state, tribal, and federal authority, viable population, travel corridors, range
requirements, control strategies, illegal killing, compensation, delisting, need for public education, spiritual
and cultural significance, social and cultural environment, recovery areas, ungulate populations, hunter harvest,
domestic livestock, land use, visitor use, economics, wolves not native to Yellowstone, wolf rights, federal subsides,
human health and safety, predators and scavengers, other endangered species, other plants, invertebrates, fish,
reptiles, amphibians, birds, and mammals, diseases and parasites, private property rights, wolf recovery in other
areas, existing wolves in Idaho and Yellowstone, existing wolves in northwestern Montana, wolf subspecies, wolf/dog/coyote
hybridization, and the need for research (Service 1994a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Service adjusted the experimental population boundaries to exclude any portion of known wolf pack territories
in an effort to reduce the likelihood that any naturally dispersing breeding groups of wolves would fall under the
proposed experimental rule regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, and using the best scientific and commercial data available, in accordance with 50 CFR 17.81, the
Service finds that releasing wolves into Yellowstone National Park constitutes reintroduction into a high-priority
site and will further advance conservation and recovery of this species.

This rule was reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Based on the information discussed in this rule concerning public projects and private activities within the experimental
population area, significant economic impacts will not result from this action. Also, no direct costs, enforcement
costs, information collection, or recordkeeping requirements are imposed on small entities by this action and the
rule contains no recordkeeping requirements, as defined in the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). This rule does not require federalism assessment under Executive Order 12612 because it would not have any significant
federalism effects as described in the order.

Due to biological requirements, the wolf reintroduction program needs to be conducted in November through February,
as recommended by wolf scientists during the EIS process. The nonessential experimental population rule has been
extensively debated and thoroughly investigated during development of the EIS and draft rules. Because of the extensive
public review of the EIS, Record of Decision, and proposed rules, all being similar to this final rule, implementation
of the wolf reintroduction program should start as of the date of publication, without a 30-day waiting period. Therefore,
for good cause and in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), the Service has determined that the rule should become effective
immediately upon filing for public inspection.

(i) Gray wolf (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Canis lupus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The gray wolves identified in paragraph (i)(7) of this section are nonessential experimental. These wolves will
be managed in accordance with the respective provisions of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Service finds that reintroduction of nonessential experimental gray wolves, as defined in (i)(7), will further
the conservation of the species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) No person may take this species in the wild in an experimental population area except as provided in paragraphs
(i) (3), (7), and (8) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Landowners on their private land and livestock producers (i.e., producers of cattle, sheep, horses, and mules
or as defined in State and tribal wolf management plans as approved by the Service) that are legally using public land
(Federal land and any other public lands designated in State and tribal wolf management plans as approved by the Service)
may harass any wolf in an opportunistic (the wolf cannot be purposely attracted, tracked, waited for, or searched
out, then harassed) and noninjurious (no temporary or permanent physical damage may result) manner at any time, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
that such harassment is non-lethal or is not physically injurious to the gray wolf and is reported within 7 days to the
Service project leader for wolf reintroduction or agency representative designated by the Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Any livestock producers on their private land may take (including to kill or injure) a wolf in the act of killing,
wounding, or biting livestock (cattle, sheep, horses, and mules or as defined in State and tribal wolf management
plans as approved by the Service), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
that such incidents are to be immediately reported within 24 hours to the Service project leader for wolf reintroduction
or agency representative designated by the Service, and livestock freshly (less than 24 hours) wounded (torn flesh
and bleeding) or killed by wolves must be evident. Service or other Service authorized agencies will confirm if livestock
were wounded or killed by wolves. The taking of any wolf without such evidence may be referred to the appropriate authorities
for prosecution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Any livestock producer or permittee with livestock grazing allotments on public land may receive a written
permit, valid for up to 45 days, from the Service or other agencies designated by the Service, to take (including to
kill or injure) a wolf that is in the act of killing, wounding, or biting livestock (cattle, sheep, horses, and mules
or as defined in State and tribal wolf management plans as approved by the Service), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
that six or more breeding pairs of wolves have been documented in the experimental population area and the Service
or other agencies authorized by the Service has confirmed that the livestock losses were caused by wolves and have
completed agency efforts to resolve the problem. Such take must be reported immediately within 24 hours to the Service
project leader for wolf reintroduction or agency representative designated by the Service. There must be evidence
of freshly wounded or killed livestock by wolves. Service or other agencies, authorized by the Service, will investigate
and determine if the livestock were wounded or killed by wolves. The taking of any wolf without such evidence may be
referred to the appropriate authorities for prosecution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Potentially affected States and tribes may capture and translocate wolves to other areas within an experimental
population area as described in paragraph (i)(7), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the level of wolf predation is negatively impacting localized ungulate populations at an unacceptable level. Such
translocations cannot inhibit wolf population recovery. The States and tribes will define such unacceptable impacts,
how they would be measured, and identify other possible mitigation in their State or tribal wolf management plans.
These plans must be approved by the Service before such movement of wolves may be conducted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The Service, or agencies authorized by the Service, may promptly remove (place in captivity or kill) any wolf the
Service or agency authorized by the Service determines to present a threat to human life or safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Any person may harass or take (kill or injure) a wolf in self defense or in defense of others, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
that such take is reported immediately (within 24 hours) to the Service reintroduction project leader or Service
designated agent. The taking of a wolf without an immediate and direct threat to human life may be referred to the appropriate
authorities for prosecution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) The Service or agencies designated by the Service may take wolves that are determined to be ``problem'' wolves.
Problem wolves are defined as: wolves that in a calendar year attack livestock (cattle, sheep, horses, and mules)
or as defined by State and tribal wolf management plans approved by the Service, or wolves that twice in a calendar year
attack domestic animals (all domestic animals other than livestock). Authorized take includes, but is not limited
to non-lethal measures such as: aversive conditioning, nonlethal control, and/or translocating wolves. Such taking
may be implemented when five or fewer breeding pairs are established in a experimental population area. If the take
results in a wolf mortality, then evidence that the mortality was nondeliberate, nonnegligent, accidental, and
unavoidable must be provided. When six or more breeding pairs are established in the experimental population area,
lethal control of problem wolves or permanent placement in captivity will be authorized but only after other methods
to resolve livestock depredations have been exhausted. Depredations occurring on Federal lands or other public
lands identified in State or tribal wolf management plans and prior to six breeding pairs becoming established in
an experimental population area, may result in capture and release of the female wolf with pups, and her pups at or near
the site of capture prior to October 1. All wolves on private land, including female wolves with pups, may be relocated
or moved to other areas within the experimental population area if continued depredation occurs. Wolves attacking
domestic animals other than livestock, including pets on private land, two or more times in a calendar year will be
relocated. All chronic problem wolves (wolves that depredate on domestic animals after being moved once for previous
domestic animal depredations) will be removed from the wild (killed or placed in captivity). The following three
criteria will be used in determining the status of problem wolves within the nonessential experimental population
area: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) There must be evidence of wounded livestock or partial remains of a livestock carcass that clearly shows that the
injury or death was caused by wolves. Such evidence is essential since wolves may feed on carrion which they found and
did not kill. There must be reason to believe that additional livestock losses would occur if no control action is taken.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(B) There must be no evidence of artificial or intentional feeding of wolves. Improperly disposed of livestock carcasses
in the area of depredation will be considered attractants. Livestock carrion or carcasses on public land, not being
used as bait under an agency authorized control action, must be removed or otherwise disposed of so that it will not
attract wolves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) On public lands, animal husbandry practices previously identified in existing approved allotment plans and
annual operating plans for allotments must have been followed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) Any person may take a gray wolf found in an area defined in paragraph (i)(7), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
that the take is incidental to an otherwise lawful activity, accidental, unavoidable, unintentional, not resulting
from negligent conduct lacking reasonable due care, and due care was exercised to avoid taking a gray wolf. Such taking
is to be reported within 24 hours to a Service or Service-designated authority. Take that does not conform with such
provisions may be referred to the appropriate authorities for prosecution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ix) Service or other Federal, State, or tribal personnel may receive written authorization from the Service to take
animals under special circumstances. Wolves may be live captured and translocated to resolve demonstrated conflicts
with ungulate populations or with other species listed under the Act, or when they are found outside of the designated
experimental population area. Take procedures in such instances would involve live capture and release to a remote
area, or placement in a captive facility, if the animal is clearly unfit to remain in the wild. Killing of wolves will
be a last resort and is only authorized when live capture attempts have failed or there is clear endangerment to human
life. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(x) Any person with a valid permit issued by the Service under &sect;17.32 may take wolves in the wild in the experimental
population area, pursuant to terms of the permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xi) Any employee or agent of the Service or appropriate Federal, State, or tribal agency, who is designated in writing
for such purposes by the Service when acting in the course of official duties, may take a wolf from the wild within the
experimental population area, if such action is for: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Scientific purposes; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) To relocate wolves to avoid conflict with human activities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) To relocate wolves within the experimental population areas to improve wolf survival and recovery prospects;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) To relocate wolves that have moved outside the experimental population area back into the experimental population
area; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) To aid or euthanize sick, injured, or orphaned wolves; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(F) To salvage a dead specimen which may be used for scientific study; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(G) To aid in law enforcement investigations involving wolves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xii) Any taking pursuant to this section must be reported immediately (within 24 hours) to the appropriate Service
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service-designated agency, which will determine the disposition of any live or dead specimens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Human access to areas with facilities where wolves are confined may be restricted at the discretion of Federal,
State, and tribal land management agencies. When five or fewer breeding pairs are in an experimental population area,
land-use restrictions may also be employed on an as-needed basis, at the discretion of Federal land management and
natural resources agencies to control intrusive human disturbance around active wolf den sites. Such temporary
restrictions on human access, when five or fewer breeding pairs are established in an experimental population area,
may be required between April 1 and June 30, within 1 mile of active wolf den or rendezvous sites and would only apply
to public lands or other such lands designated in State and tribal wolf management plans. When six or more breeding
pairs are established in an experimental population area, no land-use restrictions may be employed outside of national
parks or national wildlife refuges, unless wolf populations fail to maintain positive growth rates toward population
recovery levels for 2 consecutive years. If such a situation arose, State and tribal agencies would identify, recommend,
and implement corrective management actions within 1 year, possibly including appropriate land-use restrictions
to promote growth of the wolf population. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) No person shall possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, ship, import, or export by any means whatsoever, any
wolf or part thereof from the experimental populations taken in violation of the regulations in paragraph (i) of this
section or in violation of applicable State or tribal fish and wildlife laws or regulations or the Endangered Species
Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) It is unlawful for any person to attempt to commit, solicit another to commit, or cause to be committed any offense
defined in this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The site for reintroduction is within the historic range of the species: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) [Reserved] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The Yellowstone Management Area is shown on the following map. The boundaries of the nonessential experimental
population area will be that portion of Idaho that is east of Interstate Highway 15; that portion of Montana that is
east of Interstate Highway 15 and south of the Missouri River from Great Falls, Montana, to the eastern Montana border;
and all of Wyoming.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(iii) All wolves found in the wild within the boundaries of this paragraph (i)(7) after the first releases will be considered
nonessential experimental animals. In the conterminous United States, a wolf that is outside an experimental area
(as defined in paragraph (i)(7) of this section) would be considered as endangered (or threatened if in Minnesota)
unless it is marked or otherwise known to be an experimental animal; such a wolf may be captured for examination and
genetic testing by the Service or Service-designated agency. Disposition of the captured animal may take any of the
following courses: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) If the animal was not involved in conflicts with humans and is determined likely to be an experimental wolf, it will
be returned to the reintroduction area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) If the animal is determined likely to be an experimental wolf and was involved in conflicts with humans as identified
in the management plan for the closest experimental area, it may be relocated, placed in captivity, or killed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) If the animal is determined not likely to be an experimental animal, it will be managed according to any Service-approved
plans for that area or will be marked and released near its point of capture. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) If the animal is determined not likely to be a wild gray wolf or if the Service or agencies designated by the Service
determine the animal shows physical or behavioral evidence of hybridization with other canids, such as domestic
dogs or coyotes, or of being an animal raised in captivity, it will be kept in captivity or killed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) The reintroduced wolves will be monitored during the life of the project, including by the use of radio telemetry
and other remote sensing devices as appropriate. All released animals will be vaccinated against diseases and parasites
prevalent in canids, as appropriate, prior to release and during subsequent handling. Any animal that is sick, injured,
or otherwise in need of special care may be captured by authorized personnel of the Service or Service-designated
agencies and given appropriate care. Such an animal will be released back into its respective reintroduction area
as soon as possible, unless physical or behavioral problems make it necessary to return the animal to captivity or
euthanize it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) The status of the experimental population will be reevaluated within the first 3 years, after the first year of
releases of wolves, to determine future management needs and if further reintroductions are required. This review
will take into account the reproductive success and movement patterns of the individuals released in the area, as
well as the overall health and fate of the experimental wolves. Once recovery goals are met for downlisting or delisting
the species, a rule will be proposed to address downlisting or delisting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) The Service does not intend to reevaluate the ``nonessential experimental'' designation. The Service does
not foresee any likely situation which would result in changing the nonessential experimental status until the gray
wolf is recovered and delisted in the northern Rocky Mountains according to provisions outlined in the Act. However,
if the wolf population does not demonstrate positive growth toward recovery goals for 2 consecutive years, the affected
States and tribes, in cooperation with the Service, would, within 1 year, identify and initiate wolf management strategies,
including appropriate public review and comment, to ensure continued wolf population growth toward recovery levels.
All reintroduced wolves designated as nonessential experimental will be removed from the wild and the experimental
status and regulations revoked when (i) legal actions or lawsuits change the wolves status to endangered under the
Act or (ii) within 90 days of the initial release date, naturally occurring wolves, consisting of two breeding pairs
that for 2 consecutive years have each successfully raised two offspring, are discovered in the experimental population
area. The naturally occurring wolves would be managed and protected as endangered species under the Act.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) will reintroduce the gray wolf (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Canis lupus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
), an endangered species, into central Idaho, including a portion of southwestern Montana. These wolves will be classified
as a nonessential experimental population pursuant to section 10(j) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended
(Act). Gray wolf populations have been extirpated from most of the Western United States. They presently occur in
a small population in extreme northwestern Montana, and as incidental occurrences in Idaho, Wyoming, and Washington
as a result of wolves dispersing from existing populations in Montana and Canada. The purpose of this reintroduction
plan is to reestablish a viable wolf population in central Idaho, one of three wolf recovery areas identified in the
Northern Rocky Mountain Wolf Recovery Plan. Potential effects of this final rule were evaluated in an Environmental
Impact Statement (EIS) completed in May 1994. This gray wolf reintroduction does not conflict with existing or anticipated
Federal agency actions or traditional public uses of park lands, wilderness areas, or surrounding lands.

The Endangered Species Act Amendments of 1982, Pub. L. 97&hyph;304, made significant changes to the Endangered Species
Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (Act), including the creation of section 10(j), which provides for the designation of specific animals as ``experimental.''
Under previous authorities in the Act, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) was permitted to reintroduce
a listed species into unoccupied portions of its historic range for conservation and recovery purposes. However,
local opposition to reintroduction efforts from certain parties concerned about potential restrictions, and prohibitions
on Federal and private activities contained in sections 7 and 9 of the Act, reduced the utility of reintroduction as
a management tool. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 10(j), a listed species reintroduced outside of its current range, but within its historic range, may
be designated, at the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary), as ``experimental.'' This designation
increases the Service's flexibility and discretion in managing reintroduced endangered species because such experimental
animals may be treated as a threatened species. The Act requires that animals used to form an experimental population
be separated geographically from nonexperimental populations of the same species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional management flexibility is possible if the experimental animals are found to be ``nonessential'' to the
continued existence of the species in question. Nonessential experimental animals located outside national parks
or national wildlife refuges are treated, for purposes of section 7 of the Act, as if they were only proposed for listing.
Consequently, only two provisions of section 7 would apply to animals located outside of national wildlife refuges
and national parks_section 7(a)(1) and section 7(a)(4). Section 7(a)(1) requires all Federal agencies to establish
conservation programs for federally listed species. Utilization of Federal public lands, including national parks
and national forests, is consistent with the legal responsibility of these agencies to sustain the native wildlife
resources of the United States and to use their authorities to further the purposes of the Act by carrying out conservation
programs for endangered and threatened species. Section 7(a)(4) requires all Federal agencies to informally confer
with the Service on actions that will likely jeopardize the continued existence of species proposed to be listed as
threatened or endangered. The results of a conference are advisory in nature, and agencies are not required to refrain
from committing resources to projects as a result of a conference. In addition, section 10(j) of the Act states that
nonessential experimental animals are not subject to the formal consultation provision of the Act unless they occur
on land designated as a national wildlife refuge or national park. Activities undertaken on private lands are not
affected by section 7 of the Act unless they are funded, authorized, or carried out by a Federal agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specimens used to establish an experimental population may be removed from a source or donor population, provided
their removal is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the species and appropriate permits have been
issued in accordance with 50 CFR 17.22. Gray wolves for the reintroduction will be obtained from healthy Canadian
wolf populations with permission from the Canadian and Provincial governments. Gray wolves are common in western
Canada (tens of thousands) and Alaska (about 7,000). No adverse biological impact is expected from the removal of
about 150 from the Canadian population. Consequently, the Service finds that wolves to be used in the reintroduction
effort meet the definition of ``nonessential'' (50 CFR 17.80(b)) because the loss of the reintroduced wolves is not
likely to appreciably reduce the likelihood of survival of the species in the wild.

In 1967, the timber wolf was listed as a subspecies (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Canis lupus lycaon
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) as endangered (32 FR 4001), and in 1973 the northern Rocky Mountain subspecies, as then understood, (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. l. irremotus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) was also listed as endangered, as was the Texas subspecies (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. l. monstrabilis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (38 FR 14678). In 1978, the legal status of the gray wolf in North America was clarified by listing the Minnesota wolf
population as threatened and other members of the species south of Canada as endangered, without referring to subspecies
(43 FR 9607).

This final rule deals with the gray wolf (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Canis lupus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), an endangered species of carnivore that was extirpated from the western portion of the conterminous United States
by about 1930. The gray wolf is native to most of North America north of Mexico City, except for the southeastern United
States, where a similar species, the red wolf (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Canis rufus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), was present. The gray wolf occupied nearly every area in North America that supported populations of hoofed mammals
(ungulates), its major food source. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Twenty-four distinct subspecies of gray wolf had been recognized in North America. Recently, however, taxonomists
have suggested that there are five or fewer subspecies or group types of gray wolf in North America and that the wolf
type that once occupied the northern Rocky Mountains of the United States was more widely distributed than was previously
believed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The gray wolf occurred historically in the northern Rocky Mountains, including mountainous portions of Wyoming,
Montana, and Idaho. The drastic reduction in the distribution and abundance of this species in North America was directly
related to human activities, such as the elimination of native ungulates, conversion of wildland into agricultural
lands, and extensive predator control efforts by private, State, and Federal agencies. The natural history of wolves
and their ecological role was poorly understood during the period of their eradication in the conterminous United
States. As with other large predators, wolves were considered a nuisance and threat to humans. Today, the gray wolf's
role as an important and necessary part of natural ecosystems is better understood and appreciated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For 50 years prior to 1986, no detection of wolf reproduction was found in the Rocky Mountain portion of the United States.
However in 1986, a wolf den was discovered near the Canadian border in Glacier National Park. This find was presumably
due to the southern expansion of the Canadian wolf population. The Glacier National Park wolf population has steadily
grown to about 65 wolves and now exists throughout northwestern Montana. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reproducing wolf populations are not known to occur in Idaho or southwestern Montana. Wolves have occasionally been
sighted in these States, but do not constitute a population as defined by scientific experts (Service 1994). Historical
reports suggest that wolves may have produced young in these States; however, based on extensive surveys and interagency
monitoring efforts (Service 1994), no wolf population presently persists in these States.

Wolf Recovery Efforts: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the 1970's, the State of Montana led an interagency recovery team, established by the Service, that developed a
recovery plan for the Northern Rocky Mountain gray wolf. The 1980 recovery plan recommended a combination of natural
recovery and reintroduction be used to recover wolves in the area around Yellowstone National Park (the Park) north
to the Canadian border, including central Idaho. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A revised recovery plan was approved by the Service in 1987 (Service 1987). It identified a recovered wolf population
as being at least 10 breeding pairs of wolves, for 3 consecutive years, in each of 3 recovery areas (northwestern Montana,
central Idaho, and Yellowstone). A population of this size would be comprised of about 300 wolves. The plan recommended
natural recovery in Montana and Idaho. However, if two wolf packs did not become established in central Idaho within
5 years, the plan recommended that conservation measures other than natural recovery be considered. The plan recommended
use of the Act's section 10(j) authority to reintroduce wolves into the Park and central Idaho. By establishing a nonessential
experimental population, more liberal management practices may be implemented to address potential negative impacts
or concerns regarding the reintroduction.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1990, Congress directed appointment of a Wolf Management Committee, composed of three Federal, three State, and
four interest group representatives, to develop a plan for wolf restoration in the Park and central Idaho (Pub. L.
101&hyph;512). That committee provided a majority, but not unanimous, recommendation to Congress in May 1991. Among
the measures recommended was a declaration by Congress directing reintroduction of wolves in the Park, and possibly
central Idaho, as special nonessential experimental populations with flexible management practices by agencies
and the public to resolve potential conflicts. Wolves and ungulates would be intensively managed by the States with
Federal funding; thus, implementation was expected to be costly. Congress took no action on the committee's recommendation
which would have required an amendment to the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In November 1991 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;154), Congress directed the Service, in consultation with the National Park Service
and Forest Service, to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to consider a broad range of alternatives
on wolf reintroduction in Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho. In 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;381), Congress
directed the Service to complete the EIS by January 1994 and indicated the preferred alternative should be consistent
with existing law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service formed and funded an interagency team to prepare the EIS. The team participants were the National Park
Service; Forest Service; States of Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana; USDA Animal Damage Control; and Wind River and Nez
Perce Tribes. The Gray Wolf EIS program emphasized public participation. In the spring of 1992, the news media and
nearly 2,500 groups/individuals interested in wolves were contacted to publicize the EIS process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In April 1992, a series of 27 ``issue scoping'' open houses were held in Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho, as well as 7 other
locations throughout the United States. The meetings were attended by nearly 1,800 people, and thousands of brochures
were distributed. In total, nearly 4,000 people gave comments on EIS issues. In July 1992, a report narrating the public
comments was mailed to 16,000 people. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In August 1992, 27 additional ``alternative scoping'' open houses and 3 additional hearings were held in Wyoming,
Montana, and Idaho. Hearings were also held in Seattle, Washington; Salt Lake City, Utah; and Washington, DC. Two
major newspapers with circulation in Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho (total circulation about 250,000) distributed
a copy of the alternative scoping brochure in the Sunday edition. Nearly 2,000 people attended the meetings, and nearly
5,000 comments were received on methods for managing reintroduced wolves. Public comments typified the strong polarization
of concerns regarding wolf management. A report on the public's ideas and suggestions was mailed to about 30,000 people
in November 1992. In April 1993, a Gray Wolf EIS planning update report was published. It discussed the status of the
EIS, provided factual information on wolves, and requested the public to report wolf observations in the northern
Rocky Mountains. It was mailed to nearly 40,000 interested individuals residing in all 50 States and over 40 foreign
countries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public comment period on the draft EIS (DEIS) began on July 1, 1993, and the notice of availability was published
on July 16. The DEIS documents were mailed to potentially affected agencies, public libraries, interested groups,
and anyone who requested a copy. Additionally, a flyer containing the DEIS summary, a schedule of the 16 public hearings,
and a request to report wolf sightings was inserted into the Sunday edition of 6 newspapers (combined circulation
of about 280,000) in Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho. In mid-June 1993, the Service mailed a letter to over 300 groups,
primarily in Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho, offering a presentation on the DEIS. This resulted in 31 presentations
to about 1,000 people during the comment period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the DEIS public review period (July 1 to November 26, 1993) over 160,200 individuals, organizations, and government
agencies commented. The magnitude of the response shows the strong interest people have in wolf management. In early
March 1994, a summary of the public comments was mailed to about 42,000 people on the EIS mailing list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final EIS was filed with the Environmental Protection Agency on May 4, 1994, and the notice of availability was
published on May 9, 1994. The EIS considered five alternatives (1) Reintroduction of Experimental Wolves (2) Natural
Recovery (No action), (3) No Wolves, (4) Wolf Management Committee Recommendations, and (5) Reintroduction of Nonexperimental
Wolves. After careful review, the Service's proposed action was to reintroduce gray wolves designated as nonessential
experimental into the Park and central Idaho.

The Secretary signed the EIS Record of Decision on June 15, 1994. A letter of concurrence was signed by the Secretary

practical.

of Decision, proposed rules, and schedule of public hearings was mailed to about 50,000 people. From September 14&hyph;22,
1994, a legal notice announcing the proposed rules, hearings, and inviting public comment was published in the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer, Olympia Olympian, New Paper Agency (Salt Lake City Papers), Washington Times, Lewiston Morning

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on September 14, 1994 (59 FR 47112). Copies of the proposed rules were distributed to all interested parties. Public
hearings were held on September 27, 1994, in Boise, Idaho; Cheyenne, Wyoming; and Helena, Montana, and on September
29, 1994, in Salt Lake City, Utah; Washington, DC; and Seattle, Washington. About 90 people testified at these hearings
and about 330 people submitted written comments. Comments on the proposed rules were accepted until October 17, 1994.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In Montana, the Service has an active wolf management program due to the presence of breeding pairs of wolves. The Service's
program monitors wolves to determine their status, encourages research, provides the public with accurate information,
and controls wolves that attack domestic livestock. Wolves that depredate on livestock are translocated or removed.
Such action is required to reduce livestock losses, to foster local tolerance, and promote and enhance conservation
of wolves. The relocation of wolves under the control program is not intended to accelerate the natural expansion
of wolves into unoccupied historic habitat. Although 19 wolves have been removed under the control program, the number
of wolves has continued to expand in Montana at about 22 percent per year for the past 9 years.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reintroduction Site: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service decided to reintroduce wolves into central Idaho on or near Federal lands managed by the USDA Forest Service.
The Idaho location was selected as a site for experimental wolves because of the following factors. The central Idaho
site is a vast area of about 53,000 km2 (20,000 mi2) of contiguous National forests, including the Bitteroot, Boise,
Challis, Clearwater, Nez Perce, Payette, Sawtooth, Salmon, and Panhandle National Forests. The central area is
comprised of three wilderness areas: the Frank Church River-of-no-Return, Selway Bitteroot, and Gospel-Hump.
These wilderness areas have about 16,000 km2 (6,000 mi2) of quality wolf habitat and several good potential release
sites. The area is also far from the natural southern expansion of wolf packs from Montana. Thus, any wolves documented
inside the central Idaho experimental area would probably be from reintroduction efforts rather than naturally
dispersing extant wolf populations from Canada or northwestern Montana. The Service will also reintroduce wolves
into Yellowstone National Park as a nonessential experimental population published under a separate rule in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service determined that reintroduction of wolves into central Idaho had the highest probability to succeed due
to ecological and political considerations (Service 1994). The reintroduction effort will enhance wolf viability
by increasing genetic diversity through genetic interchange between segments of the population. The reintroduction
plan should help in achieving wolf recovery goals 20 years sooner than under current natural recovery policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because reintroduced gray wolves will be classified as a nonessential experimental population, the Service's management
practices can reduce local concerns about excessive government regulation on private lands, uncontrolled livestock
depredations, excessive big game predation, and the lack of State government involvement in the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Establishment of gray wolves in central Idaho will initiate wolf recovery in one of the three recovery areas described
as necessary for the species' recovery in the northern Rocky Mountains. No existing or anticipated Federal or State
actions identified for this release site are expected to have major effects on the experimental population. Yellowstone
National Park is identified as the only other alternative site; it will also receive wolves for reintroduction, which
will facilitate recovery in that experimental area.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reintroduction Protocol: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The wolf reintroduction project is undertaken by the Service in cooperation with the National Park Service, Forest
Service, other Federal agencies, potentially affected tribes, the States of Idaho and Montana, and entities of the
Canadian government. To obtain wolves, the Service will enter into formal agreements with the Canadian and Provincial
governments and/or resource management agencies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The central Idaho reintroduction plan requires transferring 45 to 75 wolves from southwestern Canada, representing
various sex and age classes, over a 3- to 5-year period. Under the plan, about 15 wild wolves from several different
packs using standard capture techniques will be captured annually over a period of 3 to 5 years. Captured wolves will
be transported to central Idaho. The wolves will receive any necessary veterinary care, including examinations
and vaccinations. They will be fitted with radio collars so that they can be monitored by radiotelemetry. The wolves
will be immediately released into the wild. This method is known as ``quick release,'' (i.e., the wolves will be released
upon or shortly after transport and arrival at the release site). ``Quick release'' wolves will not be held for acclimation
nor will food or care be provided after release. It is anticipated that released wolves will move widely but eventually
will find mates and form packs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, attempts to locate and/or move lone wolves dispersing throughout central Idaho will not be done. However,
wolves may be moved on a case-by-case basis, if necessary to enhance wolf recovery in the experimental area. Reintroduced
wolves will remain in the wild, as long as they are capable of sustaining themselves on carrion or wild prey. Conflicts
between wolves and humans may result in the recapture and/or removal of a wolf in accordance with procedures successfully
used with other problem wolves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An overall assessment of the success of the reintroduction will be made after the first year and for every year thereafter.
Procedures for subsequent releases could be modified, if information from the previous reintroduction warrants
such changes. The physical reintroduction phase should be completed within 3&hyph;5 years. Once the reintroduced
wolves form two packs with each pack raising two pups, for 2 consecutive years, management practices would allow the
wolves to grow naturally toward recovery levels. Wolves would only be monitored, and no further reintroduction would
take place unless fewer than two litters were produced in a single year. This reintroduction effort is consistent
with the recovery goals identified in the 1987 recovery plan for the northern Rocky Mountain Wolf. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is estimated that the central Idaho reintroduction effort, together with a similar effort in the Park and the natural
recovery occurring in northwestern Montana, could result in a viable recovered wolf population (10 breeding pairs
in each of 3 recovery areas for 3 consecutive years) by the year 2002. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service will continue to ask private landowners and agency personnel in or around central Idaho to immediately
report any wolf observations to the Service or other authorized agencies. An extensive information and education
program will discourage the taking of gray wolves by the public. Initially, all wolves will be monitored by radio telemetry
and, therefore, easy to locate if necessary. Public cooperation with the Service will be encouraged to ensure close
monitoring of the wolves and quick resolution of any conflicts that might arise.

Specific information on wolf reintroduction procedures can be found in Appendix 4, ``Scientific techniques for

Status of Reintroduced Populations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 10(j) of the Act, wolves reintroduced into central Idaho are designated as a nonessential
experimental. Such designation allows the wolves to be treated as a threatened species or species proposed for listing
for the purposes of sections 4(d), 7, and 9 of the Act. This allows the Service to establish a less restrictive special
rule rather than using the mandatory prohibitions covering endangered species. The biological status of the wolf
and the need for management flexibility resulted in the Service designating the gray wolves reintroduced into central
Idaho as ``nonessential.'' The Service determined that the ``nonessential'' designation, together with other
protective measures, will conserve and recover the gray wolf in central Idaho and southwestern Montana. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is anticipated that released wolves will come into contact with humans and domestic animals inside and outside
the central Idaho experimental population area. Public opinion surveys, public comments on wolf management planning,
and the positions taken by elected local, State, and Federal government officials indicate that wolves should not
be reintroduced without assurances that current uses of public and private lands will not be disrupted by wolf recovery
activities. The following provisions respond to these concerns. There would be no violation of the Act for unintentional,
nonnegligent, and accidental taking of wolves by the public, provided the take was incidental to otherwise lawful
activities, did not result from negligent conduct lacking reasonable due care or was in defense of human life. Such
wolf takings would need to be reported to the Service or other authorized agency within 24 hours. The Service may designate
certain Federal, State, and/or tribal employees to take wolves that required special care or pose a threat to livestock
or property. Private land owners or their designates would be permitted to harass wolves in an opportunistic noninjurious
manner on their leases or private property, provided such harassment was reported within 7 days to the Service or other
authorized agency.

Under the ``nonessential'' designation, private landowners or their designates would be permitted to take (injure
or kill) a wolf in the act of wounding or killing livestock on private land. However, physical evidence (wounded or
dead livestock) of such an attack would be required to document that the attack occurred simultaneously with the taking.
A report of such a take would need to be immediately (within 24 hours) reported to the Service or other authorized agency
for investigation. Once six or more breeding pairs are established in the experimental population area, livestock
owners or their designates could receive a permit from a Service-designated agency to take (injure or kill) gray wolves
that are attacking livestock on permitted public livestock grazing allotments. Such a take would be permitted only
after due notification to Service designated agencies and unsuccessful capture efforts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wolves that repeatedly (two times in a calendar year) attacked domestic animals other than livestock (fowl, swine,
goats, etc.) or pets (dogs or cats) on private land would be designated as problem wolves and relocated from the area
by the Service or a designated agency. After one relocation, wolves that continued to depredate on domestic animals
would be considered chronic problem wolves and would be removed from the wild. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is unlikely that wolf predation on big game populations would be a primary cause for failure of the States or tribes
to meet their specific big game management objectives outside of the national parks and national wildlife refuges.
The Service could, however, determine that wolves responsible for excessive depredation should be translocated
to other sites in the experimental area. Such actions are expected to be rare and unlikely to impact the overall recovery
rate. States and tribes would need to define such situations in their Service-approved wolf management plans before
such actions could be taken. Under the nonessential designation, wolves could not be deliberately killed solely
to resolve predation conflicts with big game. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The States of Montana and Idaho and potentially affected tribes will be encouraged to enter into cooperative agreements
for management of the gray wolf outside of national parks and national wildlife refuges. These cooperative agreements
would be reviewed annually by the Service to ensure that the States and tribes have adequate regulatory authority
to conserve listed species, including the gray wolf. The National Park Service will be the primary agency implementing
the experimental population rule inside the boundaries of national parks, while the States and tribes will be the
primary agencies implementing this experimental population rule outside national parks and national wildlife
refuges after their wolf management plans are approved by the Service. The Service will provide oversight, coordinate
wolf recovery activities, and provide technical assistance. If the States and tribes do not assume wolf management
responsibilities or adhere to provisions of their wolf management plans, the Service would assume management authority.
If for unforeseen reasons the wolf population failed to sustain positive growth toward recovery levels for 2 consecutive
years, the influencing factors would be identified. The Service and affected States and tribes would be responsible
for determining if any management strategies need modification. The Service in coordination with the States and
tribes would implement those strategies to ensure wolf population recovery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service finds that protective measures and management practices under this rulemaking are necessary and advisable
for the conservation and recovery of the gray wolf and that no additional Federal regulations are required. The Service
also finds that the nonessential experimental status is appropriate for gray wolves taken from wild populations
and released into central Idaho. The nonessential status for such wolves allows for additional management flexibility.
Nonessential experimental populations located outside of a national park or national wildlife refuge are treated
for purposes of section 7 of the Act as if they were only proposed for listing, and not listed. Only section 7(a)(l) and
section 7(a)(4) apply to Federal actions outside national parks and national wildlife refuges. Presently, there
are no conflicts envisioned with any current or anticipated management actions of the Forest Service or other Federal
agencies in the area. The national forests are beneficial to the reintroduction effort in that they form a natural
buffer to private properties and are typically managed to produce wild animals that wolves could prey upon. The Service
finds that the less restrictive section 7 requirements associated with the nonessential designation do not pose
a threat to the recovery effort and continued existence of the gray wolf.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The full provisions of section 7 apply to nonessential experimental populations in a national park or national wildlife
refuge. Consequently, the Service, National Park Service, Forest Service, or any other Federal agency is prohibited
from authorizing, funding, or carrying out an action within a national park or national wildlife refuge that is likely
to jeopardize the continued existence of the gray wolf. Pursuant to 50 CFR 17.83(b), section 7 determinations must
consider all experimental and nonexperimental wolves as a listed species for analysis purposes in national parks
and wildlife refuges. The Service has reviewed all ongoing and proposed uses of the parks and refuges and determined
that none are likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the gray wolf, nor will they adversely affect the success
of the reintroduction program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most of the reintroduction area is remote and sparsely inhabited wild lands. However, there are some risks to wolf
recovery associated with take of wolves in regard to other land uses and various recreational activities. Potential
threats are hunting, trapping, animal damage control activities, and high speed vehicular traffic. Hunting, trapping,
and USDA Animal Damage Control programs are prohibited or strictly regulated in national parks, as well as closely
regulated by State and Federal law and policy. There are very few paved or unpaved roads in the proposed reintroduction
area or immediately outside of it. The unpaved roads typically have low vehicle traffic, are constructed for low speeds
and used only seasonally. Thus, wolves should encounter vehicles infrequently. In accordance with existing labeling,
the use of toxicants lethal to wolves in areas occupied by wolves is prohibited. Overall, the possible risks and threats
that could impact the success of the reintroduction effort are thought to be minimal.

Location of Experimental Population 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The release site for reintroducing wolves into central Idaho will be on or near National Forest lands. The experimental
population area includes that portion of Idaho west of Interstate 15 and south of Interstate 90, and that part of Montana
south of Interstate 90, Highway 93 and 12 near Missoula, Montana, and west of Interstate 15.

Management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The experimental population area currently does not support any reproducing pairs of wolves. It is also unlikely
that wolves from the natural southern expansion from northwestern Montana have arrived in central Idaho. Except
for the gray wolves in northwestern Montana, only an occasional, isolated wolf has been reported, killed, or otherwise
documented in Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, or other Western States. Single packs have been reported throughout the northern
Rocky Mountains. However, these reported wolves or groups of wolves, if factual, apparently disappeared for unknown
reasons and did not establish recoverable ``populations'' as defined by wolf experts. A wolf population is defined
as at least two breeding pairs of gray wolves that each successfully raise at least two young to December 31 of their
birth year for 2 consecutive years (Service 1994). Thus, the Service has determined that the central Idaho reintroduction
is consistent with provisions of section 10(j) of the Act; specifically, that experimental wolves must be geographically
separate from other nonexperimental populations. It is possible that prior to 2002, other wolves may appear in the
wild and be attracted to the experimental population area by the reintroduced wolves or by other factors. Any ``new''
arrivals would be classified as part of the experimental population. Such wolves could assist in the recovery and
expansion of the experimental population to the point where wolves could disperse into other parts of Idaho and Montana.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wolves dispersing into areas in Idaho or Montana outside of the experimental area, would receive all the protections
of an endangered species under the Act, as did the wolves that recolonized an area near Glacier National Park in 1982.
It is possible, but not probable, that during the next 3 years wolves could move between recovery areas and enhance
the genetic diversity between natural recovery areas and reintroduction sites. However, it is not anticipated that
such exchange will significantly alter the recovery rate in the experimental population area.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the Service determined that there is no existing wolf population in the recovery area that would preclude
reintroduction and establishment of an experimental population in Idaho, the Service will continue to monitor for
the presence of any wild wolves. Prior to any reintroduction, the Service would evaluate the status of any wolves found
in the experimental population area. If a wolf population is discovered in the proposed experimental area, no reintroduction
of wolves would occur. Instead, the success of the naturally occurring wolf population would be monitored to determine
if recovery was continuing. If a natural wolf population is located in the experimental area prior to the effective
date of the final rule, then the final rule would not be implemented and there would be no reintroduction program. Wolves
naturally occurring would be classified as endangered and managed with full protection under the Act. If the natural
wolf population failed to maintain positive growth for 2 consecutive years, then the reintroduction effort could
proceed or other recovery measures could be taken. After reintroduction is completed, according to the Reintroduction
Protocol (section 5 above), management of the experimental population will begin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once the rule is in effect and wolves have been released into the recovery area, the rule would remain in effect until
wolf recovery occurs or a scientific review indicates that modifications in the experimental rule are necessary
to achieve wolf recovery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a wolf population is discovered in the central Idaho experimental population area after the effective date of the
experimental population rule but before release, reintroduction under the rule would not occur in that area and any
such wolves would be managed as a natural recovering population. Boundaries of the proposed experimental population
area would be changed, as needed, to encourage recovery of the naturally occurring, breeding wolf population. No
experimental population area would contain a portion of the home range of any active breeding pairs of wolves that
have successfully raised young, prior to the establishment of the experimental population areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management of the nonessential experimental population would allow reintroduced wolves to be killed or moved by
Service-authorized Federal, State, and tribal agencies for domestic animal depredations and excessive predation
on big game populations. Under special conditions, the public could harass or kill wolves attacking livestock (cattle,
sheep, horses, and mules). There would be no Federal compensation program, but compensation from existing private
funding sources would be encouraged. When six or more wolf packs are documented in the experimental population area
outside of the national parks and national wildlife refuges, there would be no land-use restrictions, including
areas around den sites or other critical areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wolves have a relatively high reproductive rate. Projected recruitment would off-set the anticipated 10 percent
mortality resulting from management control actions. An additional 10 percent loss could occur from other mortality
sources. Once reintroduced wolves reach the goal of six wolf packs, the reproductive output of the packs would provide
a population increase at or near 22 percent per year. Closely regulated public control (taking of depredating wolves)
would effectively focus on only individual problem wolves. Agency control actions would more likely target groups
of wolves containing problem individuals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service, and States or tribes as authorized, could move wolves that are negatively impacting ungulate populations.
Such wolves would be moved to other places within the experimental population area. Two examples when this would occur
are: (1) when wolf predation is dramatically affecting prey availability because of unusual habitat or weather conditions
(e.g., bighorn sheep in areas with marginal escape habitat); and (2) when wolves cause prey to move onto private property
and mix with livestock, increasing potential conflicts. The States and tribes will define such unacceptable impacts,
how they would be measured, and identify other possible mitigation in their State or tribal management plans which
are to be approved by the Service through cooperative agreement before such control actions are conducted. Wolves
will not be deliberately killed solely to address ungulate-wolf conflicts. Control actions by the States or tribes
likely to be significant or beyond the provisions of the experimental rule as determined by the Service would have
to be specifically incorporated into an amendment of this experimental rule and subject to national public comment
and review.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Management of wolves in the experimental population would not cause major changes to existing private or public land-use
restrictions (except at containment facilities during reintroduction) after six breeding pairs of wolves are established
in this experimental population area. When five or fewer breeding pairs are in the experimental population area,
land-use restrictions could be used as needed, and at the discretion of land management and natural resources agencies
to control intrusive human disturbance on public lands. Their implementation would be at the discretion of land management
and natural resource agencies. Before five or fewer breeding wolf pairs are established, temporary restrictions
on human access near active wolf den sites may be required between April 1 and June 30. Any restrictions on private land
would only occur with complete landowner cooperation and concurrence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service and Federal, State, or tribal agencies authorized by the Service, could promptly remove any wolf from
the experimental population once the Service, or its authorized agencies, has determined it was presenting a threat
to human life or safety. Although not a management option 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
per se,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 it is noted that a person could legally kill or injure wolves in response to an immediate threat to human life. The incidental,
unavoidable, unintentional, and accidental take in the course of otherwise lawful activity, or in defense of human
life, would be permitted by the Service and its authorized agencies, provided that such taking was not resulting from
negligent conduct lacking reasonable due care, due care was exercised to avoid taking a wolf, and the taking was immediately
(within 24 hours) reported to the appropriate authorities. Shooters have the responsibility to identify their target
before shooting. The act of taking a wolf that is wrongly identified as another species, for purposes of this rule,
will be considered as intentional, negligent, and not accidental. Such a take may be referred to the appropriate authorities
for prosecution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service, and other Federal, State, or tribal agencies after they have been designated by the Service, may control
wolves that attack livestock (cattle, sheep, horses, and mules) by aversive conditioning, nonlethal control, and/or
moving wolves when five or fewer breeding pairs are established, or by other previously described measures. Killing
wolves or placing them in captivity may only be considered when there are six or more breeding pairs established in
the experimental population area. When depredation occurs on public land and prior to the establishment of six breeding
pairs, depredating females and their pups would be captured and released at or near the site of capture, one time prior
to October 1. If depredations continue, or if six packs are present, females and their pups would be removed. Wolves
on private land under these same circumstances would be moved. Wolves that attack other domestic animals or pets on
private land, twice in a calendar year would be moved, and chronic problem wolves would be removed from the wild. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service, other Federal agencies, and State or tribal wildlife personnel would be authorized and trained to take
wolves under special circumstances. Wolves could be live-captured and translocated to resolve conflicts with State
or tribal big-game management objectives, when they are located outside of the experimental areas, or to enhance
wolf recovery. If the captured animal is clearly unfit to remain in the wild, it could be placed in a captive facility.
Killing of any wolves would be a last resort and only authorized when live capture attempts fail or there is some clear
danger to human life. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service and authorized agencies of the Service would use the following conditions and criteria to determine the
status of problem wolves within the nonessential experimental population area:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Wounded livestock or the partial remains of a livestock carcass must be presented with clear evidence (Roy and
Dorrance 1976; Fritts 1982) that the livestock injury or death was directly caused by a wolf or wolves. Such evidence
is essential for justifying any control action because wolves may feed on carrion they did not kill. Additionally,
there must be an indication that additional livestock losses may occur if the problem wolf or wolves are not controlled.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) No evidence of artificial or intentional feeding of wolves can be present. Improperly disposed livestock carcasses
located in the area of depredation will be considered attractants. On Federal lands, removal or a decision on the use
of such attractants must accompany any control action. If livestock carrion or carcasses are not being used as bait
for an authorized control action on Federal lands, it must be removed or otherwise disposed of so that they do not attract
wolves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) On Federal lands, animal husbandry practices previously identified in existing approved allotment plans and
annual operating plans for allotments must have been followed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal responsibility for protecting gray wolves under the experimental population provisions of the Act would
continue until formal delisting rulemaking procedures are completed. In accordance with the Act, delisting may
occur when analysis of the best available scientific and commercial information shows that gray wolves are no longer
threatened with extinction due to: (1) loss of habitat, (2) overutilization, (3) disease or predation, (4) inadequacy
of existing regulatory mechanisms, and (5) other natural or manmade factors. In addition to the above, the following
criteria must be met: (1) for 3 consecutive years, a minimum of 10 breeding pairs are documented in each of the 3 recovery
areas described in the revised wolf recovery plan (Service 1987); (2) protective legal mechanisms are in place; and
(3) the EIS evaluation has been completed (Service 1994). After delisting, the Act specifies a species population
must be monitored for a 5-year period. After delisting, if in any 1 of the 3 recovery areas the wolf population fell below
the minimum of 10 breeding pairs for 2 consecutive years, then wolves in that recovery area would be considered for
protective status under the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All reintroduced wolves designated as nonessential experimental will be removed from the wild and the experimental
population status and regulations revoked when (1) legal actions or lawsuits change the wolves status to endangered
under the Act or (2) within 90 days of the initial release date, naturally occurring wolves, consisting of two breeding
pairs that for 2 consecutive years have each successfully raised two offspring, are discovered in the experimental
population area. The naturally occurring wolves would be managed and protected as endangered species under the Act.

Two proposed nonessential experimental population rules for the areas of Yellowstone National Park and central
Idaho were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 16, 1994 (59 FR 42108 and 59 FR 42118, respectively) (Service 1994a). The Record of Decision, notification
of the proposed rules, and tentative schedule for public hearings were mailed to nearly 50,000 people on September
6, 1994. All interested parties were requested to submit factual reports or information that might contribute to
the development of the final rule. Appropriate Federal and State agencies, county governments, scientific organizations,
and other interested parties were contacted and requested to comment. A legal notice announcing the proposed rules,
hearings, and inviting public comment were published in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Olympia Olympian, New
Paper Agency (Salt Lake City Papers), Washington Times, Lewiston Morning Tribune, The Idaho Statesman, Wyoming
Tribune, Casper Star Tribune, Bozeman Daily Chronicle, and Billings Gazette beginning on September 14, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service held six public hearings on the proposed rules. A notification of the hearings and availability of the
Record of Decision and proposed rules was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on September 14, 1994 (59 FR 47112). Copies of the proposed rules were distributed to all interested parties. Public
hearings were held on September 27, 1994, in Boise, Idaho; Cheyenne, Wyoming; and Helena, Montana; and on September
29, 1994, in Salt Lake City, Utah; Washington, DC; and Seattle, Washington. About 90 people testified at these hearings
and about 330 people submitted written comments. Comment on the proposed rules was accepted until October 17, 1994.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A total of 426 written and oral responses, representing 621 signatures, were received during the proposed rule 34-day
comment period. Several letters, including letters from the Governor of the State of Wyoming and the Colorado Wool
Growers Association, were received after comment period closed. However, these letters were reviewed and considered.
From October 17 to 24, 1994, a specialized interagency team analyzed the public comments. After October 31, 1994,
the team's report was distributed to agency cooperators and to anyone requesting it (Service 1994c). In addition
to the public comments, three Notices of Intent to Sue were received. The Service has completed its review and consideration
of all written and oral comments. All of the issues raised by the public on the proposed rules were previously identified
and addressed in the final EIS: The Reintroduction of Gray wolves to Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho.
Analysis of the comments revealed 25 issues which are identified and are discussed below.

1. Several conditions on when wolves may be harassed or taken were removed from the final rule. The following conditions
are not part of the final rule_(1) distinction between adult wolves and pups and (2) harassment may only occur for 15
minutes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. In the discussion of the final rule, it was clarified that after a private individual takes a depredating wolf, no
additional agency actions will be conducted to control problem wolves in an area, unless more livestock depredations
occur. This assumes that the problem wolf was killed, and therefore, no other control actions are required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Several terms in the final rule were clarified and defined, including ``opportunistic noninjurious harassment,''
``unintentional take,'' ``disposal of livestock carrion,'' issuance criteria for a wolf take permit to a grazing
lessee on public lands, and criteria for resolving wolf/ungulate conflicts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. A termination clause was added to the final rule. The clause clarifies the Service's role and responsibilities
regarding the establishment of an experimental population. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Three years following the initial reintroduction of wolves, a thorough review will be conducted. The review will
determine if further reintroductions are required and if, to date, the management program has been successful. A
provision to the rule was added that if the reintroduction and management practices under the experimental population
rule did not result in wolf recovery, the Service would take appropriate actions. Such actions would be caused by the
failure of the wolf population to maintain positive growth for 2 consecutive years. All corrective actions would
be coordinated with affected States, tribes, and other Federal agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Language regarding scientific or technical decisions in discussion of the rule was changed. Design study and reintroduction
techniques may be changed or modified when expert and skilled biologists determine such changes are necessary and
prudent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A list of relevant issues based on public comments and the Service's response to those issues follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Issue 1:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The subspecies of wolf that occupied the Yellowstone area was 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Canis lupus irremotus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The reintroduction program will use wolves from Canada which were once classified as a different subspecies; therefore,
this violates the experimental population provision of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Service Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In recent times, there have been several revisions to the taxonomic classification of wolves in North America. Several
scientific investigations have dealt with this issue (Brewster and Fritts 1994, Nowak 1994, Wayne et al. 1994). These
investigations concluded (1) there were fewer wolf subspecies than previously believed, (2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
irremotus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 was not a distinct subspecies, and (3) that wolves might be better classified as types or representative groups of
geographic or climatic conditions rather than distinct subspecies. The northern Rocky Mountains are within the
historic range of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Canis lupus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Investigators concluded that reintroduction of wolves from Canada to the Park or central Idaho would accelerate
the ongoing natural southern expansion of the species. Additionally, it was determined that current taxonomic discussions
of wolf subspecies should not affect wolf recovery efforts in the northern Rocky Mountains of the United States.

Issue 2:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The amendment to section 10(j) of the Act states that experimental populations may only be designated when there is
geographical separation between the experimental population and other existing populations of the species. The
occasional occurrence of lone wolves in the areas of central Idaho and the Park would prohibit the use of the experimental
population designation since there would be no geographic separation between natural occurring and experimental
wolves. Comments also stated that the boundaries of the experimental areas should be adjusted or the reintroduction
program should be delayed, particularly, in central Idaho due to the presence of naturally occurring wolves.

 For many years, the Service and other agencies have tried to document wolf activity in Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming
(Service 1994a, Appendix 12). Since the 1970's, wolf observations particularly from Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho,
have been reported. However, to date the only documented breeding groups of wolves are in northwestern Montana. Based
on scientific inquiry, the Service defines a wolf population as at least two breeding pairs of wild wolves each successfully
raising at least two young each year, for 2 consecutive years, and that a population is composed of breeding groups
of wolves (Service 1994a, Appendix 9). Presently, there are no known breeding pairs of wolves within the experimental
population area. Nor does the experimental area contain any portions of home ranges of any breeding pairs of wolves.
The Service finds that there is no geographic overlap between any Montana wolf population home range and the experimental
area. The northern boundary of the Idaho experimental population area was moved further south because, in 1990 and
1992, there were a few instances when an active breeding group of wolves from Montana were located south of the experimental
boundary recommended in the proposed rule. The rulemaking language now allows revocation of the experimental population
rule and removal of all reintroduced wolves, if within 90 days after the initial reintroduction a naturally occurring
wolf population is discovered in the experimental area. Any naturally occurring wolves will be managed as endangered
species under the Act and afforded the same terms and conditions as wolves in Montana. The Service has had a wolf monitoring
program in place in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming for over two years. This system is designed to accept reports from anyone,
and when a report focuses on a particular area a wolf biologist investigates to verify the presence or absence of wolves.
Through this method the Service has identified newly formed packs in northwest Montana. Within the experimental
area, there has been no confirmation of wolves from any provided reports.

For the past 20 years and presently, the Service and others have searched for wolves in the northern Rocky Mountains.
Reviews of correspondence from the past 25 years show the longstanding and widespread view that wolves already occupied
Idaho and the discovery of their presence imminent. Very extensive monitoring within the experimental population
area has not confirmed the presence of wolves. This particular species is not habitat limited and if allowed to get
into the experimental area would reproduce and survive. The translocation of wild wolves from Canada to central Idaho
will provide the opportunity to start a wolf population. This translocation effort will greatly facilitate recovery
of the gray wolf. The 1987 Rocky Mountain wolf recovery plan recommended an additional 5 years of monitoring for natural
wolf recovery in Idaho. However, the recovery plan provided other options if two breeding pairs of wolves had not become
established in Idaho during the 5 years. Because no breeding pairs have been located, the draft and final EIS and Record
of Decision allow the simultaneous reintroduction of wolves into central Idaho and the Park in an effort to ensure
the viability and conservation of wolves in the Rocky Mountains (Service 1994a, Appendix 16).

The Service proposed a very liberal experimental rule to accommodate concerns of local residents and the affected
States. However, it did not make allowances for unforeseen circumstances that may impede or prevent wolf population
growth and recovery. Options such as increased management or greater numbers of reintroductions should be allowed
if required.

The Service believes that, as proposed, reintroduction and management techniques will result in wolf population
recovery and delisting by about 2002. Rulemaking language was added clarifying that take activities must lead to
eventual recovery of the wolf. Additionally, if there is no progress in achieving wolf population recovery (i.e.,
if wolves in a recovery area do not exhibit positive growth for 2 consecutive years), then factors impacting population
growth will be investigated. Information from the investigation will be made available to the public and appropriate
Federal, State, and tribal agencies. Within a year, the agencies may recommend and implement new management actions
or modifications to their wolf management plans to correct factors negatively impacting wolf recovery. Only as a
last resort would changes or modifications to sections of the experimental rule be made.

The proposed rules' requirements that ``only adult wolves (greater than 50 pounds) can be harassed'' and then ``only
for 15 minutes'' and ``only adult wolves that are witnessed attacking livestock on private land can be killed by private
parties'' are overly restrictive. The provision that wolves can only be killed under a special permit when (1) seen
attacking livestock for the third time on Federal lands, (2) six or more wolf packs are present in the experimental
population, and (3) all agency control efforts have failed does not address the issues in a timely or efficient manner.
The implication that land-use restrictions may be employed on private lands when five or fewer wolf packs are present
in the experimental area also needs clarification.

The Service agrees and has eliminated (1) the distinction between adult wolves and pups for both noninjurious harassment
and take and (2) the length of time wolves may be harassed (as long as physical injury is not incurred). Permittees with
grazing rights on public land can readily obtain a written take permit for wolves seen attacking livestock. However,
issuance criteria still require that prior to issuing the 45-day take permit (1) six or more wolf packs must be present
in the experimental population area, (2) authorized agencies must confirm that a wolf caused the livestock injury
or death, and (3) other agency control actions have failed to resolve the problem. The final rule also clarifies that
no land-use restrictions will be exercised by Federal agencies on private land at any time.

The Service added or clarified definitions and/or language in the final rule. However, the wolf reintroduction program
is complex and has many unforeseen variables. It is impossible to imagine or describe in detail every situation that
might arise during its implementation. Some situations can only be accurately addressed on a case-by-case basis
and judged by their particular circumstances. It is the intent of the Service to use the experimental rule to aid the
conservation, recovery, and eventual delisting of wolf populations in the northern Rocky Mountains of the United
States. The Service in cooperation with other Federal, State and tribal agencies will use the flexibility of the experimental
rule to address local concerns and unforeseen situations. The professional expertise and experience of wildlife
managers will facilitate the implementation and any modifications needed to improve the wolf reintroduction program.
Additional language was added to the rule, clarifying that management flexibility is required as the program is implemented
and refined.

To date, the Federal government has funded the participation of affected States and tribes in regard to the wolf restoration
program. The Service plans to continue its funding commitment within Congressional appropriations until wolves
are delisted. The public stated its concern over the use of taxpayer dollars and the need for government to wisely spend
tax dollars. The Service, therefore, must keep expenses for wolf reintroduction as low as possible while maintaining
an effective program. The Service will encourage the States and tribes to submit reasonable budgets for wolf management
programs, as well as search for ways to pool and coordinate resources so that overall costs are reduced. It is the legal
responsibility of the Service to monitor the progress and adherence of State and tribal agencies to their management
plans. The Service will ensure and work cooperatively with others to meet the stated recovery goals.

In Montana, the Defenders of Wildlife implemented a private livestock compensation program. Because the Defenders
Program has been successful, it was expanded to include Idaho and Wyoming. The Service will not directly fund a livestock
compensation program. The Service will encourage livestock producers to utilize private compensation programs
when depredation occurs. The Service and USDA Animal Damage Control will aid livestock producers by maintaining
an effective control program that minimizes livestock losses due to wolves. The rule addresses the concerns of private
property owners by (1) providing an effective control program, (2) allowing landowners to take wolves on their private
land when justified, and (3) invoking no land-use restrictions on private land. The Service has reviewed the constitutionality
of this rule in regard to protected private property rights. The review concludes the Service's actions do not violate
the private property rights of individuals (Service 1994a, Appendix 6).

 It is well documented that the Service made an extraordinary effort to involve the public and other government entities
in developing management practices and the experimental population rules regarding the wolf reintroduction program.
During the past 3 years, the Service held over 100 meetings, open houses, and hearings. The Service distributed over
750,000 documents and reviewed and considered nearly 170,000 public comments during development of the rule. Federal
agencies and affected States and tribes were active participants during the process. This final rule represents
the participatory work and consensus of affected agencies and others interested or impacted by the rulemaking.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Service is confident in the States' and tribes' ability to evaluate the impact wolf predation may have on ungulate
populations and, when appropriate, implement corrective management actions. An evaluation of possible impacts
and/or actions in regard to a specific ungulate species, and location is best accomplished by biologists most familiar
with the situation. The Service, States, and tribes will coordinate wolf management plans to ensure that State and
tribal interests in native ungulate management are met while meeting the Service's mandate for wolf recovery. Rulemaking
language was added to the section on how States and tribes will manage ungulate/wolf conflicts. States and tribes
are required to prepare acceptable management plans for approval by the Service. It is expected that since these management
plans may affect State wildlife management programs, the States will go through a public review process as part of
their development. Such plans will indicate the point at which wolf/ungulate conflicts become so critical that corrective
action must be taken. A decision to translocate wolves to reduce such conflicts must serve to enhance, or at a minimum
not inhibit, wolf recovery.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The timeframes for a person to report the harassing (7 days) and/or the unintentional taking (24 hours) of wolves were
not changed. The harassing or taking of a wolf is a critical and potentially serious event. A person who harasses a wolf
is best served by reporting the incident as soon as possible so agency management actions can be implemented, if necessary.
Submission of a report on wolf harassment provides a record which can document the continuation of suspected or actual
livestock depredations or rationale for taking a wolf. The immediate reporting of livestock depredation by a wolf
also allows the immediate investigation of the incident and gathering of fresh evidence. In Montana, agency professionals
who investigate livestock depredations are readily accessible during the night, weekends, and holidays. During
the past 9 years in Montana, the reporting, documenting, and resolution of livestock depredations have not been significant
issues. Therefore, they are not anticipated to be a problem for wolf reintroductions into the experimental population
areas. The United States legal system often takes into account unusual mitigating circumstances, such as the remoteness
of a livestock allotment interfering with an individual being able to report an incident as required by regulation.
The Service could determine that an incident would not be referred for prosecution when a person failed to meet the
reporting requirements and could justify their actions.

 In accordance with the Act, delisting may occur when analysis of the best available scientific and commercial information
shows that gray wolves are no longer threatened with extinction due to: (1) Loss of habitat, (2) overutilization,
(3) disease or predation, (4) inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms, and (5) other natural or manmade factors.
In addition to the above, the final EIS, states that the following criteria must be met: (1) For 3 consecutive years,
a minimum of 10 breeding pairs are documented in each of the 3 recovery areas described in the revised wolf recovery
plan (Service 1987); (2) protective legal mechanisms are in place; and (3) the EIS evaluation has been completed (Service
1994). After delisting, the Act specifies a species population must be monitored for a 5-year period. After delisting,
if in any 1 of the 3 recovery areas the wolf population fell below the minimum of 10 breeding pairs for 2 consecutive years,
then wolves in that recovery area would be considered for protective status under the Act. Delisting procedures have
been discussed (Service 1994a, Appendix 11). Endangered wolves in northwestern Montana can be downlisted to threatened
once 10 breeding pairs are documented for 3 consecutive years. Experimental populations of wolves cannot be downlisted
because their protective status is based on the experimental population rule. Experimental population rules can
be withdrawn when wolf numbers have reached recovery levels, no further protection under the Act is required, and
the wolf is delisted.

 The Service prepared and published an intra-Service evaluation of its proposed action in the draft and final EIS (Service

would not adversely impact other endangered or threatened species. In November 1994, Service field offices in Idaho,
Montana, and Wyoming reviewed the proposed rules and came to the same conclusion. The Service finds that the impact
of the final rules, like the predicated impact reviewed of the proposed rules, will not adversely affect other protected

 The hybridization of wolves with other canids may occur; however, it is not a significant problem anywhere in North
America where ranges of wolves, domestic dogs, coyotes, and foxes overlap (Chapter 1). Thus, it is not anticipated
to be a problem in the northern Rocky Mountains. The rules state the Service or other authorized agencies may remove
reintroduced wolves that breed with domestic dogs, coyotes, or foxes, or their hybrid-offspring. Individual animals
that agency biologists suspect to be domesticated wolves or wild wolf/other canid species hybrids would be removed
from the wild after examination of the canid's physical or behavioral characteristics.

 It is documented that individual wolves may disperse over 500 miles. However, for the past 10 years, there has been
no evidence of naturally occurring wolves dispersing to and producing a viable wolf population in the central Idaho
or Yellowstone areas. After the effective date of the experimental population rules, any such wolves and their offspring
would be treated as experimental population animals. From a practical wildlife management perspective, the Service
cannot be expected to determine if an individual wolf had naturally dispersed into the area or been reintroduced.
The initial reintroduced animals will be radio collared and thus, can be differentiated. Once they have reproduced
it would be impossible to determine if the wolf was a wild dispersing animal or progeny of the experimental animals.
The rule was written to help avoid that possible conflict. Such a distinction, therefore, cannot be treated separately
by regulation. Undoubtedly, the establishment of a viable wolf population and recovery of the species will be enhanced
by the reintroduction of 30 wolves annually for the next 3 to 5 years. The presence of reintroduced wolves may increase
the probability of naturally dispersing wolves from northwestern Montana or Canada to move, stay, and reproduce
in an experimental area. While this event would contribute to population recovery, it would not greatly impact the
overall population growth rate since the majority of breeding wolves would be reintroduced animals.

 Wolves are adaptable to a wide variety of human activities, except for deliberate killing. Experiences in North America
indicate that human disturbance, even around active den sites, is not a significant factor affecting wolf survival
or population growth (Service 1994a, Appendix 13). The rule protects active wolf dens during the earliest stages
of wolf recovery, if necessary. Killing wolves is illegal except for a very few limited exceptions. The rule allows
flexibility to reconsider land use restrictions if wolf populations do not grow toward recovery levels. Wolves in
Montana have not needed land-use restrictions and, at this time, land-use restrictions do not appear necessary for
wolf populations to recover in Idaho or Wyoming.

 The opportunity for private individuals to kill wolves in the experimental population areas is limited to when wolves
are actually in the act of killing livestock. The Service has determined that wolves that exhibit this behavior do
not further the conservation of the species and for that reason are currently controlled (Service 1988). The selective
removal of this type of individual animal by the public is warranted in certain limited circumstances and their removal
contributes to overall conservation of the species. Agency control would be initiated anyway and, under tight regulation,
public control can be more likely to remove the specific problem individual than agency control actions because the
action is taken immediately. If a wolf is taken in the act of depredating, further agency control would not be conducted
unless additional depredations occur. This limited taking of wolves by the private sector could reduce the total
number of wolves that might be taken in response to livestock depredations and reduces the opportunity for other wolves
to feed on or learn to depredate on livestock.

 As stated in the Service's EIS, in the proposed rule, and in the final rule, removal of wolves from Canadian populations
would not significantly impact those populations (59 FR 42110); the likelihood that wolf populations would become
permanently established and grow to recovery level in the experimental areas is extremely high (59 FR 42111); reintroduction
would greatly accelerate wolf population recovery, enhance wolf population viability, and lead to subsequent delisting
(59 FR 42110); and the reintroduced wolves and subsequent population that developed would not be affected by existing
or anticipated Federal or State actions or private activities within or adjacent to the experimental population
area (59 FR 42112); therefore, release of the experimental population would further the conservation of the species
(Service 1994a, Service 1994b).

 The rule clarifies that while the States and tribes are encouraged to lead implementation of the experimental rule,
the Service will monitor and is ultimately responsible for the recovery of the species. Should progress toward wolf
recovery not be evident (two years of no growth would trigger other conservation measures), the Service will cooperate
with the states and tribes to assure steps are taken to resume progress toward recovery. The states and tribes already
have highly trained professional wildlife management programs in place and their expertise, authorities, knowledge,
and organizations can greatly enhance recovery of the species. Animal Damage Control is a professional federal wildlife
management agency that has the responsibility, like all federal agencies, to use their authorities to enhance the
recovery of listed species. Animal Damage Control has been a valuable and necessary component of wolf recovery activities
in Montana and Minnesota.

 The measure of success in the wolf recovery program is not the level of wolf population mortality but growth of the wolf
population. Wolf populations can withstand varying levels of mortality and individual wolf mortality is very difficult
to measure accurately. Language was added to the final rule that clarifies the need to modify the State and tribal plans,
which must be in compliance with the rule, if wolf population growth is not evident. Wolf population growth is easier
to accurately monitor and is the criteria that is used to implement other provisions in the rule (e.g. when lethal control
may be used, when a population is established, when reintroductions stop, and when wolf populations are recovered).
A ``put and take'' strategy does not address the problem of a wolf population failing to maintain growth and is an expensive
process to conduct. It is more productive to identify the factors preventing wolf population growth and correct them
before simply continually adding more wolves that may die from the same causes. A population that required constant
reintroductions to compensate for excessive mortality rates could not be delisted.

 The Service determined the boundaries of the experimental populations based upon the distribution of the wolf population
in Montana. The experimental population boundaries do not include any portion of any known area used by breeding wolves
in Montana. It was also determined that any wolf population inside the experimental boundaries would most likely
be the result of reintroduced wolves and any breeding groups of wolves outside the experimental boundaries would
likely be the result of natural dispersal of wolves from northwestern Montana or Canadian populations. The definition
of a wolf population underwent scientific peer review (Service 1994a, Appendix 8). The rationale and location of
the experimental population boundaries were also reviewed, and no better consensus of a way to define the geographic
range of a wolf population was brought to the Service's attention.

 Once a wolf population is established in an experimental area there is no need to conduct further reintroductions
and to do so would not be cost effective. The soonest the ``wolf population'' criteria could be met is in three years.
At that time about 45 wolves would have been reintroduced to each area. The recovery process and assurance of substantial
genetic diversity, pack formation, and birth of about 10&hyph;20 pups should have occurred following the reintroduction
of 45 animals. This would eliminate the need for additional reintroductions and would allow manpower and funds to
be used on monitoring population growth and dispersal.

 The provisions on legally present livestock are part of the rule so that control of problem wolves will occur only when
livestock are present on public land in a manner already allowed by conditions in their federal, state, or tribal grazing
permit. No new conditions are expected because of wolf reintroduction. Control of wolves that attack livestock should
not be expected when livestock are illegally present on federal lands. Proper livestock husbandry practices means
the current standards and practices used by livestock producers as already determined by the land management agency
issuing the permit. No changes from the standard livestock grazing practices already being used on federal grazing
leases are envisioned. Wolf management in Montana has not affected livestock management practices on public lands
and would likely not affect those practices in other areas. Issues like proper disposal of livestock carrion are already
being addressed in the Yellowstone area because of other concerns such as grizzly bear recovery. Language in the final
rule reflects that carrion must be managed in such a way as not to present a continuing attractant to wolves if problems
occur, but leaves the livestock producer and land management agency to determine how best to address potential problems.

 The Service has reviewed public concern about the accuracy of its early responses to issues raised in the draft and
final EIS, which were also raised by persons commenting on the proposed rule. At this time, the information provided
during the public comment period on the proposed rule does not provide sufficient data or cause for the Service to significantly
change any of its earlier findings which were published in the final EIS regarding the issues of: amending the Endangered
Species Act, wolves as a missing component of the ecosystem, humane treatment of wolves, enjoying wolves, regulated
public take, cost of the program, state, tribal, and federal authority, viable population, travel corridors, range
requirements, control strategies, illegal killing, compensation, delisting, need for public education, spiritual
and cultural significance, social and cultural environment, recovery areas, ungulate populations, hunter harvest,
domestic livestock, land use, visitor use, economics, wolves not native to Yellowstone, wolf rights, federal subsides,
human health and safety, predators and scavengers, other endangered species, other plants, invertebrates, fish,
reptiles, amphibians, birds, and mammals, diseases and parasites, private property rights, wolf recovery in other
areas, existing wolves in Idaho and Yellowstone, existing wolves in northwestern Montana, wolf subspecies, wolf/dog/coyote
hybridization, and the need for research (Service 1994a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service adjusted the experimental population boundaries to exclude any portion of known wolf pack territories
in an effort to reduce the likelihood that any naturally dispersing breeding groups of wolves would fall under the
proposed experimental rule regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, and using the best scientific and commercial data available, and in accordance with 50 CFR 17.81,
the Service finds that releasing wolves into central Idaho constitutes reintroduction into a high-priority site
and will further advance conservation and recovery of this species.

This rule was reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Based on the information discussed in this rule concerning public projects and private activities within the experimental
population area, significant economic impacts will not result from this action. Also, no direct costs, enforcement
costs, information collection, or recordkeeping requirements are imposed on small entities by this action and the
rule contains no recordkeeping requirements, as defined in the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). This rule does not require federalism assessment under Executive Order 12612 because it would not have any significant
federalism effects as described in the order.

Due to biological requirements, the wolf reintroduction program needs to be conducted in November through February,
as recommended by wolf scientists during the EIS process. The nonessential experimental population rule has been
extensively debated and thoroughly investigated during development of the EIS and draft rules. Because of the extensive
public review of the EIS, Record of Decision, and proposed rules, all being similar to this final rule, implementation
of the wolf reintroduction program should start as of the date of publication, without a 30-day waiting period. Therefore,
for good cause and in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), the Service has determined that the rule should become effective
immediately upon filing for public inspection.

(i) Gray wolf (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Canis lupus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The gray wolves (wolf) identified in paragraph (i)(7) of this section are nonessential experimental. These wolves
will be managed in accordance with the respective provisions of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Service finds that reintroduction of nonessential experimental gray wolves, as defined in (i)(7) of this
section, will further the conservation of the species.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) No person may take this species in the wild in an experimental population area except as provided in paragraphs
(i)(3), (7), and (8) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Landowners on their private land and livestock producers (i.e., producers of cattle, sheep, horses, and mules
or as defined in State and tribal wolf management plans as approved by the Service) that are legally using public land
(Federal land and any other public lands designated in State and tribal wolf management plans as approved by the Service)
may harass any wolf in an opportunistic (the wolf cannot be purposely attracted, tracked, waited for, or searched
out, then harassed) and noninjurious (no temporary or permanent physical damage may result) manner at any time, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that such harassment is non-lethal or is not physically injurious to the gray wolf and is reported within 7 days to the
Service project leader for wolf reintroduction or agency representative designated by the Service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Any livestock producers on their private land may take (including to kill or injure) a wolf in the act of killing,
wounding, or biting livestock (cattle, sheep, horses, and mules or as defined in State and tribal wolf management
plans as approved by the Service), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that such incidents are to be immediately reported within 24 hours to the Service project leader for wolf reintroduction
or agency representative designated by the Service, and livestock freshly (less than 24 hours) wounded (torn flesh
and bleeding) or killed by wolves must be evident. Service or other Service authorized agencies will confirm if livestock
were wounded or killed by wolves. The taking of any wolf without such evidence may be referred to the appropriate authorities
for prosecution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Any livestock producer or permittee with livestock grazing allotments on public land may receive a written
permit, valid for up to 45 days, from the Service or other agencies designated by the Service, to take (including to
kill or injure) a wolf that is in the act of killing, wounding, or biting livestock (cattle, sheep, horses, and mules
or as defined in State and tribal wolf management plans as approved by the Service), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that six or more breeding pairs of wolves have been documented in the experimental population area and the Service
or other agencies authorized by the Service has confirmed that the livestock losses were caused by wolves and have
completed agency efforts to resolve the problem. Such take must be reported immediately within 24 hours to the Service
project leader for wolf reintroduction or agency representative designated by the Service. There must be evidence
of freshly wounded or killed livestock by wolves. Service or other Service authorized agencies will investigate
and determine if the livestock were wounded or killed by wolves. The taking of any wolf without such evidence may be
referred to the appropriate authorities for prosecution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Potentially affected States and tribes may capture and translocate wolves to other areas within an experimental
population area as described in paragraph (i)(7), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the level of wolf predation is negatively impacting localized ungulate populations at an unacceptable level. Such
translocations cannot inhibit wolf population recovery. The States and tribes will define such unacceptable impacts,
how they would be measured, and identify other possible mitigation in their State or tribal wolf management plans.
These plans must be approved by the Service before such movement of wolves may be conducted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The Service, or agencies authorized by the Service, may promptly remove (place in captivity or kill) any wolf the
Service or agency authorized by the Service determines to present a threat to human life or safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Any person may harass or take (kill or injure) a wolf in self defense or in defense of others, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that such take is reported immediately (within 24 hours) to the Service reintroduction project leader or Service
designated agent. The taking of a wolf without an immediate and direct threat to human life may be referred to the appropriate
authorities for prosecution.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(vii) The Service or agencies designated by the Service may take wolves that are determined to be ``problem'' wolves.
Problem wolves are defined as wolves that in a calendar year attack livestock (cattle, sheep, horses, and mules) or
as defined by State and tribal wolf management plans approved by the Service or wolves that twice in a calendar year
attack domestic animals (all domestic animals other than livestock). Authorized take includes, but is not limited
to non-lethal measures such as: aversive conditioning, nonlethal control, and/or translocating wolves. Such taking
may be done when five or fewer breeding pairs are established in a experimental population area. If the take results
in a wolf mortality, then evidence that the mortality was nondeliberate, accidental, nonnegligent, and unavoidable
must be provided. When six or more breeding pairs are established in the experimental population area, lethal control
of problem wolves or permanent placement in captivity will be authorized but only after other methods to resolve livestock
depredations have been exhausted. Depredations occurring on Federal lands or other public lands identified in State
or tribal wolf management plans and prior to six breeding pairs becoming established in an experimental population
area may result in capture and release of the female wolf with pups, and her pups at or near the site of capture prior to
October 1. All wolves on private land, including female wolves with pups, may be relocated or moved to other areas within
the experimental population area if continued depredation occurs. Wolves attacking domestic animals other than
livestock, including pets on private land, two or more times in a calendar year will be relocated. All chronic problem
wolves (wolves that depredate on domestic animals after being moved once for previous domestic animal depredations)
will be removed from the wild (killed or placed in captivity). The following three criteria will be used in determining
the status of problem wolves within the nonessential experimental population area: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) There must be evidence of wounded livestock or partial remains of a livestock carcass that clearly shows that the
injury or death was caused by wolves. Such evidence is essential since wolves may feed on carrion which they found and
did not kill. There must be reason to believe that additional livestock losses would occur if no control action is taken.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) There must be no evidence of artificial or intentional feeding of wolves. Improperly disposed of livestock carcasses
in the area of depredation will be considered attractants. Livestock carrion or carcasses on public land, not being
used as bait under an agency authorized control action, must be removed or otherwise disposed so that it will not attract
wolves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) On public lands, animal husbandry practices previously identified in existing approved allotment plans and
annual operating plans for allotments must have been followed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) Any person may take a gray wolf found in an area defined in paragraph (i)(7), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that the take is incidental to an otherwise lawful activity, accidental, unavoidable, unintentional, not resulting
from negligent conduct lacking reasonable due care, and due care was exercised to avoid taking a gray wolf. Such taking
is to be reported within 24 hours to a Service or Service-designated authority. Take that does not conform with such
provisions may be referred to the appropriate authorities for prosecution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ix) Service or other Federal, State, or tribal personnel may receive written authorization from the Service to take
animals under special circumstances. Wolves may be live captured and translocated to resolve demonstrated conflicts
with ungulate populations or with other species listed under the Act, or when they are found outside of the designated
experimental population area. Take procedures in such instances would involve live capture and release to a remote
area or placement in a captive facility, if the animal is clearly unfit to remain in the wild. Killing of wolves will
be a last resort and is only authorized when live capture attempts have failed or there is clear endangerment to human
life. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(x) Any person with a valid permit issued by the Service under &sect;17.32 may take wolves in the wild in the experimental
population area, pursuant to terms of the permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xi) Any employee or agent of the Service or appropriate Federal, State, or tribal agency, who is designated in writing
for such purposes by the Service, when acting in the course of official duties, may take a wolf from the wild within the
experimental population area, if such action is for: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Scientific purposes; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) To relocate wolves to avoid conflict with human activities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(C) To relocate wolves within the experimental population areas to improve wolf survival and recovery prospects;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) To relocate wolves that have moved outside the experimental population area back into the experimental population
area; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) To aid or euthanize sick, injured, or orphaned wolves; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(F) To salvage a dead specimen which may be used for scientific study; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(G) To aid in law enforcement investigations involving wolves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xii) Any taking pursuant to this section must be reported immediately (within 24 hours) to the appropriate Service
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service-designated agency, which will determine the disposition of any live or dead specimens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Human access to areas with facilities where wolves are confined may be restricted at the discretion of Federal,
State, and tribal land management agencies. When five or fewer breeding pairs are in an experimental population area,
land-use restrictions may also be employed on an as-needed basis, at the discretion of Federal land management and
natural resources agencies to control intrusive human disturbance around active wolf den sites. Such temporary
restrictions on human access, when five or fewer breeding pairs are established in an experimental population area,
may be required between April 1 and June 30, within 1 mile of active wolf den or rendezvous sites and would only apply
to public lands or other such lands designated in State and tribal wolf management plans. When six or more breeding
pairs are established in an experimental population area, no land-use restrictions may be employed outside of national
parks or national wildlife refuges, unless wolf populations fail to maintain positive growth rates toward population
recovery levels for 2 consecutive years. If such a situation arose, State and tribal agencies would identify, recommend,
and implement corrective management actions within 1 year, possibly including appropriate land-use restrictions
to promote growth of the wolf population. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) No person shall possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, ship, import, or export by any means whatsoever, any
wolf or part thereof from the experimental populations taken in violation of the regulations in paragraph (i) of this
section or in violation of applicable State or tribal fish and wildlife laws or regulations or the Endangered Species
Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) It is unlawful for any person to attempt to commit, solicit another to commit, or cause to be committed any offense
defined in this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The site for reintroduction is within the historic range of the species: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The central Idaho area is shown on the following map. The boundaries of the nonessential experimental population
area will be those portions of Idaho that are south of Interstate Highway 90 and west of Interstate 15, and those portions
of Montana south of Interstate 90, Highway 93 and 12 from Missoula, Montana west of Interstate 15.

(iii) All wolves found in the wild within the boundaries of this paragraph (i)(7) after the first releases will be considered
nonessential experimental animals. In the conterminous United States, a wolf that is outside an experimental area
(as defined in paragraph (i)(7) of this section) would be considered as endangered (or threatened if in Minnesota)
unless it is marked or otherwise known to be an experimental animal; such a wolf may be captured for examination and
genetic testing by the Service or Service-designated agency. Disposition of the captured animal may take any of the
following courses: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) If the animal was not involved in conflicts with humans and is determined likely to be an experimental wolf, it will
be returned to the reintroduction area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) If the animal is determined likely to be an experimental wolf and was involved in conflicts with humans as identified
in the management plan for the closest experimental area, it may be relocated, placed in captivity, or killed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) If the animal is determined not likely to be an experimental animal, it will be managed according to any Service
approved plans for that area or will be marked and released near its point of capture. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) If the animal is determined not to be a wild gray wolf or if the Service or agencies designated by the Service determine
the animal shows physical or behavioral evidence of hybridization with other canids, such as domestic dogs or coyotes,
or of being an animal raised in captivity, it will be returned to captivity or killed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(8) The reintroduced wolves will be monitored during the life of the project, including by the use of radio telemetry
and other remote sensing devices as appropriate. All released animals will be vaccinated against diseases and parasites
prevalent in canids, as appropriate, prior to release and during subsequent handling. Any animal that is sick, injured,
or otherwise in need of special care may be captured by authorized personnel of the Service or Service-designated
agencies and given appropriate care. Such an animal will be released back into its respective reintroduction area
as soon as possible, unless physical or behavioral problems make it necessary to return the animal to captivity or
euthanize it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) The status of the experimental population will be reevaluated within the first 3 years, after the first year of
releases of wolves, to determine future management needs and if further reintroductions are required. This review
will take into account the reproductive success and movement patterns of the individuals released in the area, as
well as the overall health and fate of the experimental wolves. Once recovery goals are met for downlisting or delisting
the species, a rule will be proposed to address downlisting or delisting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) The Service does not intend to reevaluate the ``nonessential experimental'' designation. The Service does
not foresee any likely situation which would result in changing the nonessential experimental status until the gray
wolf is recovered and delisted in the northern Rocky Mountains according to provisions outlined in the Act. However,
if the wolf population does not demonstrate positive growth toward recovery goals for 2 consecutive years, the affected
States and tribes, in cooperation with the Service, would, within 1 year, identify and initiate wolf management strategies,
including appropriate public review and comment, to ensure continued wolf population growth toward recovery levels.
All reintroduced wolves designated as nonessential experimental will be removed from the wild and the experimental
population status and regulations revoked when (i) legal actions or lawsuits change the wolves status to endangered
under the Act or (ii) within 90 days of the initial release date, naturally occurring wolves, consisting of two breeding
pairs that for 2 consecutive years have each successfully raised two offspring, are discovered in the experimental
population area. The naturally occurring wolves would be managed and protected as endangered species under the Act.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In this document, the Bureau of Prisons is amending its rule on Pretrial Inmates. Changes made in this amendment include
the addition of provisions for the review of the pretrial inmate's status, the replacement of references to waiver
of separation, and a revision of the definition of ``pretrial inmate'' to clarify that the definition does not include
an inmate who is awaiting sentence once the Bureau has received notification of the conviction. This document also
makes several other procedural, editorial, and nomenclature changes. This amendment is intended to update Bureau
of Prisons policy regarding pretrial inmates.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Bureau of Prisons is amending its rule on Pretrial Inmates. A final rule on this subject was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 November 13, 1980 (45 FR 75133). For the convenience of the reader, the entire text of the rule is being published. A
summary of the changes follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The subpart has been revised to remove gender-specific references. In addition, various editorial and conforming
amendments (such as revising ``pre-trial'' to read ``pretrial'') have been made as necessary. These editorial and
conforming amendments make no change in the intent of the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 551.100 is revised for the sake of clarity and to include a statement that pretrial inmates will be separated,
to the extent practicable, from convicted inmates. The practicability of separation is contingent upon the design,
structure, and operation of the individual institution. Where it is not practicable to keep all pretrial inmates
separate, after intake screening and assessment, Bureau staff may, based upon sound correctional judgment, permit
inmates who do not present a risk to the security or orderly running of the institution to have regular contact with
convicted inmates. As part of its mandate to provide for the care, custody, control, treatment, and instruction of
inmates, the Bureau provides a range of programming opportunities to convicted inmates. These programming opportunities
may be made available to pretrial inmates if staff determine that such would be consistent with institution security
and good order. Pretrial inmates will have the opportunity to discuss separation needs with staff during intake screening
and reviews. Previously, the Bureau provided for inmates to request a waiver of separation. Under this former procedure,
Bureau staff were still responsible for making the determination to maintain or not to maintain separation for pretrial
inmates. This revision, therefore, does not lessen the Bureau's commitment to provide for the safety of pretrial
inmates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 551.101 is revised and reorganized for the sake of clarity. New paragraph (a) introductory text is revised
to clarify that ``pretrial inmate'' means a person who is legally detained but for whom the Bureau has not received
notification of conviction. A person who has pleaded or been found guilty and who is awaiting sentence is not considered
to be a pretrial inmate once the Bureau has received notification of conviction. This change is consistent with the
provisions of 18 U.S.C. 3142(i)(2) which states that pretrial inmates are to be kept separate, to the extent practicable,
from persons awaiting or serving sentences. New paragraph (a)(1) substitutes the phrase ``deportable alien'' for
``detained alien'' to better clarify the intent of this paragraph. New paragraph (a)(2) specifies which types of
mental health commitments under 18 U.S.C. Chapter 313 should be considered as pretrial inmates. Inmates who have
been committed to the Bureau for long-term custody and who are not awaiting further court proceedings are not considered
to be pretrial inmates. Former paragraph (a)(2) is reworded and redesignated as new paragraph (a)(3). Paragraph
(b) is revised to remove administrative references to the Judgment and Commitment form. The sentencing court uses
that form to provide notice of conviction to the Bureau, ordinarily following imposition of sentence. Procedures
for receiving notice of conviction are included in implementing instructions to staff.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 551.103 is amended by adjusting the codification designations (former paragraph (a) becomes introductory
text, and subordinate paragraphs (a)(1), (2), etc. become (a), (b), etc.) for the sake of editorial consistency.
The nomenclature used in the introductory paragraph has been revised (the phrase ``institutions with detention-unit
operations'' has been replaced by the phrase ``administrative institutions or institutions with administrative
components housing U.S. Marshals' prisoners''). Newly designated paragraph (e) is revised to remove redundant
information contained in the Bureau's rule on Intake Screening (see 28 CFR 522, subpart C) and to include reference
to separation advisory. Newly designated paragraph (f) is revised to specify that institution guidelines governing
telephone calls, including procedures for making unmonitored calls to an attorney, are provided to pretrial inmates
rather than advice on these guidelines. This revision ensures that pretrial inmates will have complete guidance
on the use of telephones at their disposal. A new paragraph (i) is added to specify that pretrial inmates shall have
the opportunity to waive the right not to work, and former paragraph (a)(9) is redesignated as new paragraph (j). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 551.104 is revised to state that, to the extent practicable, pretrial inmates will be housed separately from
convicted inmates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 551.105(a) is revised to clarify that staff ordinarily will supervise a pretrial inmate as if classified
``In'' custody. There is no change in the intent of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 551.106 has been revised for the sake of clarity. There is no change in the intent of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changes in statutory authority have removed provision of good time for inmates whose offenses were committed after
November 1, 1987. Consequently &sect;551.107 is removed, and a new &sect;551.107 is added containing provisions
for review of pretrial inmate status. These reviews afford pretrial inmates the opportunity to discuss with staff
factors relating to the inmate's detention. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute referenced in &sect;551.109 is changed to reflect the current provision. The intent of this section is
unchanged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 551.110 has been revised to remove references to waiver of separation. As revised, paragraph (b) specifies
that pretrial inmates who do not participate in religious programs with convicted inmates have access to other religious
programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 551.111 is revised to indicate that the U.S. Marshals Service is also to be contacted for comment on a pretrial
inmate's marriage request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;551.112, paragraph (b) is amended to remove reference to waiver of separation. As revised, this paragraph
specifies that pretrial inmates may be allowed the opportunity to have access to the institution's educational program
when consistent with institution security and good order. Previously, this paragraph stated that such inmate may
have full access. Some Bureau programs, for reasons of institution security and good order, may be inappropriate
for pretrial inmates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;551.113, paragraph (a) has been revised to remove reference to waiver of separation and to specify that pretrial
inmates may be allowed the opportunity to receive counseling services with convicted inmates when consistent with
institution and good order. Paragraph (b) has been revised to specify that staff shall ensure that pretrial inmates
who do not receive counseling services with convicted inmates have access to other counseling services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;551.115, paragraph (a) has been revised to remove reference to waiver of separation and to specify that pretrial
inmates may be allowed the opportunity to participate with convicted inmates in recreational activities when consistent
with institution security and good order or have access to other recreational activities. Paragraph (b) has been
amended to clarify the intended meaning of a pretrial inmate in regular population. As revised, paragraph (b) now
includes a cross reference to conditions for pretrial inmates in Administrative Detention or Disciplinary Segregation.
Paragraphs (d) and (e) have been reordered for organizational reasons. There is no change in the intent of this section.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;551.116, the word ``continuing'' is replaced by the word ``serious''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because these changes impose no further restrictions on inmates, deal with agency procedures designed to help ensure
the continued protection of inmates, or conform to statutory provisions, the Bureau finds good cause for exemption
from the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of proposed rulemaking,
the opportunity for public comment, and delay in effective date. Members of the public may submit comments concerning
this rule by writing the previously cited address. These comments will be considered but will receive no response
in the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bureau of Prisons has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action for the purpose of E.O. 12866;
this rule was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. After review of the law and regulations, the Director,
Bureau of Prisons has certified that this rule, for the purpose of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354),
does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

In addition to convicted inmates, the Bureau of Prisons houses persons who have not been convicted. Procedures and
practices required for the care, custody, and control of such inmates may differ from those established for convicted
inmates. Pretrial inmates will be separated, to the extent practicable, from convicted inmates. Except as specified
by this rule, policies and standards applicable to persons committed to the custody of the Attorney General or the
Bureau of Prisons apply also to pretrial inmates as defined in &sect;551.101.
