<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This recommended decision invites written exceptions on proposed amendments to the subject marketing agreement
and order (order). The proposed amendments would include authority to: regulate shipments of potatoes within the
production area, change representation and quorum procedures of the Idaho-Eastern Oregon Potato Committee (committee),
set container marking and labeling requirements, and require the committee to consider, at least every six years,
changes in committee size or reapportionment of committee membership. Also, other proposals would change committee
fiscal operations, add confidentiality and verification provisions to the order, and make other miscellaneous
changes that would be consistent with the proposed amendments. The proposed amendments are designed to improve order
operations.

Preliminary Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice is hereby given of the filing with the Hearing Clerk of this recommended decision with respect to the proposed
further amendment of the Marketing Agreement and Marketing Order No. 945, regulating the handling of Irish potatoes
grown in designated counties in Idaho and Malheur County, Oregon, and of the opportunity to file written exceptions
thereto. Copies of this decision may be obtained from Valerie L. Emmer, James B. Wendland, or Gary D. Olson, whose addresses
are listed above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice is issued pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7
U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act,'' and the applicable rules of practice and procedure governing the formulation
of marketing agreements and orders [7 CFR part 900].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed further amendment of the Marketing Agreement and Order No. 945 is based on the record of a public hearing
held in Idaho Falls, Idaho, on September 8, 1993. Notice of this hearing was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 11, 1993. The notice of hearing contained eight proposals submitted by the committee, which locally administers
the order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those proposed amendments would: (1) Redefine ``ship or handle'' to include shipments of potatoes within the production
area; (2) provide seed producers with representation on the committee and add authority for the committee to recommend
to the Secretary changes in the committee size and composition; (3) update ``Districts'' to show the current composition;
(4) require the committee to consider, at least every six years, whether to recommend changes in committee size or
reapportionment of committee membership; (5) change committee quorum procedures; (6) remove an outdated assessment
limitation of $1 per carload and allow the committee to impose late payment or interest fees, or both, on late assessment
payments, accept advance payments, and borrow monies in an extreme emergency for program administration; (7) add
authority for the committee to recommend container marking and labeling requirements; and (8) specify confidentiality
requirements for handler reports submitted to the committee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The notice of hearing also included one proposal and a portion of another by the Fruit and Vegetable Division, Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS), U.S. Department of Agriculture (Department), which would add requirements regarding
the verification of reports; and make such changes as are necessary to the order, if any or all of the above amendments
are adopted, so that all of its provisions conform with the proposed amendments. The Department also proposed revising
the language in several sections of the order that are in need of updating.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No person testified in opposition to any of the proposals offered at the hearing and no alternative proposals were
offered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the conclusion of the hearing, the administrative law judge fixed October 1, 1993, as the final date for interested
persons to file corrections to the hearing transcript, proposed findings and conclusions, and written arguments
or briefs based on the evidence received at the hearing. On October 1, the administrative law judge extended the deadline
to October 15, since the transcript of the hearing had not been received. On October 14, the deadline was further extended
to November 1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Russell O. Baum of Ashton, Idaho, submitted a comment objecting to the term ``Irish Potato'' as an ethnic misrepresentation
of the true identity of the commonly referred potato. He suggested that consideration be given to more accurately
renaming the potato by either: (1) Dropping ``Irish''; (2) changing it to ``Burbank Potato'', in recognition of the
fact that Luther Burbank originated the major species of potatoes grown in Idaho; (3) changing it to ``American Generic
Potato'' because the potato originated in the Americas, and not in Ireland; or (4) adopting any other more correct
name. Since this comment is outside the scope of the proposals specified in the notice of hearing, it is denied.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Small Business Considerations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) [5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.], the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small agricultural service firms, which include handlers regulated under this order,
have been defined by the Small Business Administration (SBA) [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts for
the last three years of less than $5,000,000. Small agricultural producers are defined as those having annual receipts
of less than $500,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Interested persons were invited to present evidence
at the hearing on the probable regulatory and informational impact of the proposed amendments on small businesses.
The record indicates that handlers would not be unduly burdened by any additional regulatory requirements, including
those pertaining to reporting and recordkeeping, that might result from this proceeding. The record also indicates
that a majority of handlers and producers would meet the SBA definitions of small agricultural service firms and small
agricultural producers, respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the 1992&hyph;93 crop year, 66 handlers were regulated under Marketing Order No. 945. In addition, there were
approximately 2,200 producers of potatoes in the production area. The Act requires the application of uniform rules
on regulated handlers. Since handlers covered under the potato marketing order are predominantly small businesses,
the order itself is tailored to the size and nature of small businesses. Marketing orders and amendments thereto,
are unique in that they are normally brought about through group action of essentially small entities for their own
benefit. Thus, both the RFA and the Act are compatible with respect to small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendments to the order include amending: &sect;945.20 Establishment and membership pertaining to
operations of the committee, including providing seed producers representation on the committee; &sect;945.23
Redistricting and reapportionment authorizing changes in committee size, composition, and representation; &sect;945.30
Procedure regarding quorum requirements; and &sect;945.42 Assessments removing a $1 per carload maximum assessment
rate and allowing the committee to impose late payment and interest fees on late assessment payments and borrow monies
in an extreme emergency for program administration. These proposed amendments would provide an opportunity for
broader based representation on the committee and more flexibility to adjust to future changes in industry structure,
potato production and financial operations. These changes are designed to enhance the administration and functioning
of the order and would have negligible, if any, economic impact on small businesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal amending &sect;945.9 Ship or handle would broaden the scope of the order by revising the definition of
these terms to include the handling of potatoes in the current of commerce within the counties covered by the order's
production area. This would require the inspection of all regulated shipments of potatoes for fresh market and compliance
with order requirements, including grade, size, quality, pack, and payment of assessments. This proposal would
improve the market for potatoes handled within the production area. This would benefit both producers and handlers
because minimum grade, size and quality requirements established under the order are important to the industry in
fostering consumer satisfaction, increasing the demand for Idaho-Eastern Oregon potatoes, and improving industry
returns. The additional assessment income would improve the financial operations of the order. Any added burden
on small businesses should be outweighed by the added benefits accruing to them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change to allow the rate of assessment to be based on a hundredweight of potatoes, rather than an outdated
maximum amount of $1 per railroad carload, would improve the financial operations of the order and not adversely impact
small businesses. This change would provide more efficient funding of order operations and activities. Fresh potato
shipments have stabilized in recent years, and if costs continue to rise, the current maximum rate is likely to be insufficient
to properly fund committee operating costs beyond the next few years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another recommended change would amend &sect;945.52 Issuance of regulations to add authority to require accurate
and uniform marking and labeling of the containers. The benefits of the expected higher returns that could result
from increases in buyer and consumer satisfaction due to accurate marking and labeling should outweigh any potential
burden on small businesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another proposed amendment, to &sect;945.80 Reports, would provide confidentiality requirements for reports
submitted to the committee. This would safeguard handlers' proprietary information, including that for small businesses,
without imposing any burden on them. Additionally, new &sect;945.80 provisions would add authority for the Secretary
and the committee to verify the accuracy of reports filed by handlers, and handler compliance with recordkeeping
requirements. The requirement would not have a significant impact on small entities in the industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the proposed amendments would have no significant impact or burden on small businesses' recordkeeping
and reporting requirements.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All of these changes are designed to enhance the administration and functioning of the marketing agreement and order
to the benefit of the industry. If implemented, these amendments might impose some costs on affected handlers and
producers. However, the added burden on small entities, if present at all, would not be significant because the benefits
of the proposed amendments are expected to outweigh the costs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendments proposed herein have been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. They are not
intended to have retroactive effect. If adopted, the proposed amendments would not preempt any state or local laws,
regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with the amendments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 [44 U.S.C. Chapter 35], any additional handler reporting and
recordkeeping requirements, including any new reports and the two succeeding fiscal periods record retention,
that might result from the proposed amendments would be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The
provisions would not be effective until receiving OMB approval.

Findings and Conclusions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The findings and conclusions on the material issues, all of which are based on evidence presented at the hearing and
the record thereof, are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Section 945.9 Ship or handle of the order should be amended to authorize the regulation of fresh market shipments
of Irish potatoes within the production area, which includes Malheur County, Oregon, and the counties of Adams, Valley,
Lemhi, Clark, and Fremont in Idaho, and all of the counties in Idaho lying south thereof. Currently, the order authorizes
regulating interstate and foreign shipments of fresh market Irish potatoes grown in the production area. This recommended
change would broaden the scope of the order to cover shipments within the production area, as well as those outside
the production area. The Act exempts potatoes for canning, freezing, or other processing from regulation under any
order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The lack of regulation of fresh market potatoes within the production area has caused a number of significant problems
for the industry. Sales of unregulated potatoes within the production area have (1) depressed the price of potatoes
sold in other markets; (2) made compliance more difficult since the committee cannot track these unregulated potatoes,
allowing handlers to claim that their potatoes were sold within the production area and were thus exempt from regulation;
and (3) adversely affected the committee's income since assessments are not collected on these potatoes. Yet, such
handlers may receive the higher prices typically paid for the higher quality potatoes resulting from the committee's
mandatory quality control activities, without absorbing any of the costs to conduct these activities. Based on per
capita figures, an estimated 48.8 million pounds of Idaho-Eastern Oregon fresh market potatoes are consumed annually
within the production area, compared with about 3.3 billion pounds of sales outside the production area. Since potatoes
marketed within the production area are not currently subject to the order's mandatory inspection, minimum grade,
size, quality, maturity, pack, and assessment requirements, the market for potatoes within the production area
has received a large volume of poor quality, ungraded potatoes. The prices paid for such undesirable potatoes are
typically lower than those paid for the better quality required under the order for potatoes shipped outside the production
area. This lower quality price has depressed the price for all potatoes in that market. Also, with modern communications
and daily Market News reports nationwide, lower prices in the production area become known quickly in other markets
and have a depressing effect on prices in those markets as well. This negative effect on prices is contrary to the policy
of the Act, which includes establishing and maintaining orderly marketing conditions and increasing returns to
producers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Record evidence indicates that the price of potatoes in production area markets has a direct and immediate effect
on prices in markets outside that area. Therefore, under the order, the handling of potatoes within the production
area directly burdens, obstructs, or affects the handling of potatoes in interstate commerce to such an extent as
to make appropriate the regulation of potatoes in Malheur County, Oregon, and in the counties of Adams, Valley, Lemhi,
Clark, and Fremont in the State of Idaho, and all counties in Idaho lying south thereof. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although it was not included in the notice of hearing, the proponents testified that ``consign'' should be added to
the other actions included in the definition of ``ship or handle'' specified in &sect;945.9. The record indicates
that ``consign'' is defined as an agreement between a buyer and seller for the transportation of product to be marketed
with no previous determination of the return of the product. It is the responsibility of the buyer to market the product
and return to the seller the proceeds. This should be included as ``handling'' because the ``agent'' or ``handler''
who receives the commodity is engaged in the buying, selling and distributing of the commodity into market channels.
Record evidence supported adding ``consign'' to the definition of ``ship or handle''.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Such changes are hereby recommended and would be implemented upon amendment of the order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Section 945.20 Establishment and membership should be amended to provide that at least one member and alternate
member position for District No. 1 on the Idaho-Eastern Oregon Potato Committee shall be represented by producers
predominately of potatoes for seed. The committee is the administrative body selected by the Secretary to make recommendations
for operating the order. Currently, the order specifies that the committee shall consist of eight members, of whom
five shall be producers. For each member there shall be an alternate who shall have the same qualifications as the member.
However, there has been no requirement that any producer should be predominately a seed producer. There are approximately
200 seed producers involved in this unique production and marketing facet of the industry. Since approximately 90
percent of the order's seed production comes from District No. 1, it is appropriate that the seed producer member and
alternate should come from that district. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seed potatoes are typically produced in areas isolated from where potatoes are produced for commercial fresh or processing
markets. Seed potato needs are different than those for fresh market consumption. Seed potato buyers are particularly
concerned about receiving certified seed potatoes, which require that certain plant diseases are within established
tolerances, and that potatoes are of an appropriate (smaller) size for planting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This change in representation would allow for new and more specific ideas from this unique facet of the industry. Providing
for such representation would be consistent with a stated objective of the Department's Guidelines for Fruit, Vegetable,
and Specialty Crop Marketing Orders of improving representation and allowing for different and more contemporary
ideas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A proponent for this proposal testified that proposed seed producer members not be required to be producing potatoes
or to have produced potatoes during the previous two years. However, the order specifies that to be eligible to serve
as a producer on the committee the person must be currently producing potatoes. Also, being a current producer would
result in better qualified nominees who would be more knowledgeable of the current problems and situation regarding
seed potato production and marketing. To best represent seed producers, the nominees for the position should be current
producers who predominately produce seed potatoes and who have produced such potatoes during at least three of the
last five years. The order defines 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Producer 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
as any person engaged in the production of potatoes for market. It is also a requirement that to vote in any referendum
held under the order a producer must be producing potatoes at that time. Currently, the order only specifies two types
of committee members_producers and handlers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal would encourage, to the maximum extent possible, broader-based participation by all industry members
of the regulated community in the administration of the order. It is hereby concluded that this provision should be
changed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The section should also be amended by adding a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (d) to require that at least every six years, the committee shall review committee size, composition, and
representation and recommend to the Secretary whether changes should be made, as provided in &sect;945.23 Redistricting
and reapportionment. Currently, no minimum period is specified during which the committee should review whether
significant changes in the industry warrant a change in committee representation. However, the industry is dynamic
and some changes in acreage, production, and number of producers and handlers occur every year. Although review of
the committee structure could be conducted annually, testimony indicated that at least every six years was an appropriate
period within which the committee should review the changes and recommend whether the Secretary should change committee
makeup or representation. Record evidence supports the need to provide the committee with flexibility to make necessary
changes in the composition of the committee to reflect future changes in industry structure or production shifts.
These changes to this section are hereby recommended.

(3) Section 945.22 Districts currently specifies the original districts which had been established in 1941. The
order has authority in &sect;945.23 to change districts through informal rulemaking. In 1972, new districts were
established, based on the significant changes in industry conditions since the order was first issued in 1941. The
proposal simply updates the Districts section to list the current districts. This change would also bring the district
listings in &sect;945.22 in conformity with the listings specified in &sect;945.130 Reestablishment of districts
and reapportionment of committee membership of the rules and regulations. It is hereby recommended that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;945.22 be revised by listing the current districts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The proposed amendment to &sect;945.23 Redistricting would revise the heading to read ``Redistricting and reapportionment'',
and would reapportion committee membership. No new authority is being proposed. Existing provisions are simply
being rearranged for easier reference. In &sect;945.20 it is recommended that authority be provided for a seed producer
member and alternate to serve on the committee representing District No. 1. The section should continue to provide
flexibility to reestablish districts within the production area, reapportion committee membership among the various
districts, and change committee size and composition. Section 945.24 Selection currently specifies committee
membership as it was constituted prior to being reapportioned in 1972. The order has authority in &sect;945.23 to
reapportion committee membership among the various districts through informal rulemaking. The proposal is simply
to update the listing to the current apportionment. District No. 1 is shown as consisting of two producer members and
one handler member, with their respective alternates. The proponents testified that District No. 1's representation
should be shown as three producer members (one to be a new seed producer position) and one handler member, with their
respective alternates. District No. 2 specifies one producer member and one handler member, with their respective
alternates. No revision in this representation is needed for District No. 2. District No. 3 currently lists two producer
members and one handler member, with their respective alternates. The proponents testified that it should show one
producer member position (after one had been moved to District No. 1, to now provide a new seed producer member position).
Therefore, District No. 3 membership should be revised to provide for one producer member and one handler member,
with their respective alternates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Future representation should be as recommended by the committee and approved by the Secretary, as significant changes
occur in the industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also &sect;945.24 Selection, should be revised to eliminate paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) which lists the committee
membership apportionment for Districts Nos. 1, 2 and 3, to avoid redundancy in the language as recommended in &sect;945.23.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the recommended revision of &sect;945.20 Establishment and membership that adds a paragraph requiring
that the committee, at least every six years, review committee size, composition, and representation, and recommend
any changes to reflect developments in the industry, &sect;945.23 should also be revised by adding a similar paragraph
specifying that at least every six years the committee should review industry changes and recommend any necessary
redistricting, reapportioning, or change in committee size or composition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Paragraph (a) of &sect;945.30 Procedure should be revised to require a simple majority of all members of the committee,
including alternates acting for members, to constitute a quorum or to pass any motion or approve any committee action,
except any motion regarding a change in committee size shall require a unanimous vote. Currently, there is an eight-member
committee, and five members are necessary to constitute a quorum and to pass any action. The proponents have testified
that the committee should have the authority to recommend changes in the size of the committee to adjust to future changes
in the industry. Any size increase approved by the Secretary would necessitate a corresponding change in the number
required for a quorum and to pass any action. Rather than specify all the possible combinations of such numbers, record
evidence supports adoption of the proponents' proposed language that a quorum be a simple majority. This would simplify
procedures if the committee size is changed. Therefore, it is hereby recommended that &sect;945.30 Procedure be
amended by specifying that a simple majority of all members, including alternates acting for members, shall be necessary
to constitute a quorum to pass any motion or approve any committee action, except any motion regarding a change in committee
size shall require a unanimous vote. Changing the committee size is such a significant action that it should be favored
by all committee members. It was testified that a near unanimous vote would not suffice, even if it might give one member
veto power over the committee.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(6) Section 945.42 Assessments deals with the administrative funding of committee operations. The Act authorizes
establishment of an agency, the committee, to administer the order. Currently, the order authorizes the committee,
with the approval of the Secretary, to make expenditures and establish an assessment rate for each fiscal period for
assessable potatoes shipped under the order. Any assessment in excess of expenses incurred during a fiscal period
may be carried over as a reserve, provided that reserve funds do not exceed approximately one fiscal period's budgeted
expenses. Each handler who ships potatoes into regulated markets is required to pay a pro rata share of the committee's
expenses. Currently, the order specifies such assessments shall not exceed $1 per carload, or equivalent quantity.
Potatoes for canning, freezing, or other processing are exempt from regulation, including assessments. Record
evidence supports revising paragraph (b) to remove the outdated assessment limitation of $1 per carload. Since railcar
capacities have increased significantly after this limit was set more than three decades ago and the load per carload
may vary greatly, it has become impractical to base the assessment rate on this fixed rate per carload. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Committee operating costs have continued to rise over the years along with the cost of living and presumably will continue
to do so. However, total assessments collected during the past five years have tended to stabilize at an average of
$78,434 per year. Thus, assessment income under present order authority is not expected to keep up with rising costs.
Although the committee presently has adequate operating reserve funds and does not anticipate any need to increase
the assessment rate in the near future, record evidence indicates that the current maximum assessment rate of $1 per
carload will not be sufficient to properly fund committee expenses for the long term administration of the order.
Therefore, the evidence supports providing authority to establish an assessment on a different unit basis of potatoes.
The proponents recommended that the assessment be levied at a rate per hundredweight of potatoes or equivalent quantity.
Such rate would be recommended by the committee and approved by the Secretary through informal rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This section should also be amended by adding a paragraph (c) to provide authority for the committee to impose a late
payment or interest charge, or both, upon any handlers who are delinquent in their assessment payments. Currently,
there is no such incentive to pay assessments in a timely manner. It is unfair to other handlers who pay assessments
promptly if another handler fails to pay assessments when due. A delinquent handler has an advantage in the use of these
unpaid assessment funds. Also, delinquencies by some handlers leads to delinquencies by others. Moreover, nonpayment
of assessments can have an adverse effect on the stable financial operation of an order and may require the committee
to borrow money and pay interest to continue operation. Record evidence indicates that the charging of late payment
or interest charges, or both, on all late accounts would defray some of the added cost of collecting such accounts and
discourage handlers from delaying their payments. The late payment and interest rate charges would be recommended
by the committee, subject to approval by the Secretary through informal rulemaking. An example of such charges would
be similar to what commercial businesses charge, such as a five dollar late fee and one and one-half percent per month
on the unpaid balance. Other similar programs which had experienced problems in collecting assessments promptly
have found such provisions useful and effective. The provision should be of similar value to the Idaho-Eastern Oregon
potato order.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section should also be amended by adding a paragraph (e) to provide authority for the committee to accept advance
assessment payments from handlers. Although handlers could make advance payments of assessments at any time, the
provision would be most needed by the committee when its funds were short. The committee could send a request to handlers
for voluntary advance assessment payments. Prepayments would be credited toward assessments levied against that
handler during that fiscal period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A question raised at the hearing was whether the committee should have authority to offer a small discount, such as
one percent, to any handler who made advance assessment payments. The witness testifying on the proposal to authorize
advance payments declined to answer the question. No witness offered evidence that supported such a discount as a
routine procedure. The committee manager testified that he would support a discount in case of emergency. Therefore,
due to the lack of record evidence and because such discounted assessment rate is contrary to both &sect;945.42 Assessments
language and the providing of one uniform assessment rate on all first handlers (which shall be such handler's pro
rata share of the committee's approved expenses), it is determined that such discount should not be authorized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The committee should be authorized to borrow money on a short term basis in case of an extreme emergency, such as a disastrous
year regarding potato production, to continue normal operations. The authority to borrow money is not intended to
permit the committee to obligate itself to borrow large sums of money over an extended period of time. Such borrowing
should only be used when necessary to meet financial obligations when operating reserve funds are inadequate and
until sufficient assessment revenue could be generated to repay the loan and meet other financial obligations necessary
to insure continued operation of the order. The loan should be repaid by the end of the next fiscal period. Any such borrowed
money would only be used to meet the committee's current financial obligations. It is hereby recommended that &sect;945.42
of the order be amended to include the above provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Section 945.52 Issuance of regulations should be amended by revising paragraph (a)(3) to add authority to require
accurate and uniform marking and labeling of the containers in which production area potatoes are shipped. Such authority
would help interested persons more readily identify such shipments and help buyers in managing inventory and marketing
the potatoes. These advantages can foster buyer satisfaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The industry has had problems of confusion from count cartons being sold without the size being marked on the container.
Section 945.341 (c) Pack specifies the size, count (number of potatoes needed to fill a 50-pound container), and allowable
weight range of each potato therein. Information was provided that such unmarked cartons have been sold at inflated
prices by wholesalers who misrepresented the contents as larger and more valuable potatoes. An example is unmarked
cartons of 100 count potatoes which were sold by the wholesaler as larger 90 count because 90 count was what the end user
had requested. The end users complained because they did not receive the larger potatoes and were overcharged for
the smaller ones. Thus, wholesalers were getting paid a higher price by misrepresenting potatoes as a larger size.
This practice has damaged the Idaho-Eastern Oregon potato industry in three ways_it deprives the handler of the higher
price that should be paid him/her by the wholesaler for the larger potatoes, it harms the industry's high quality reputation
and it creates a dissatisfied end user. Such confusion and damage to the industry and consumers would be eliminated
by authorizing requirements for accurate markings on containers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another example would involve bulk potato loads which enter the order's production area from another State such as
Nevada, and are repacked in Idaho. If the repacked containers did not show that the potatoes were grown in Nevada, but
showed potatoes were packed or distributed in Idaho, any buyer or consumer could be misled into believing they had
purchased Idaho-grown potatoes. Section 945.65 Inspection and certification specifies that potatoes must be inspected
and be covered by a valid inspection certificate and that repacking any lot of potatoes invalidates any prior inspection
certificate. When non-production area potatoes are repacked in production area facilities, those potatoes must
meet the order's requirements unless the Federal-State Inspection Service representative in the facility is satisfied
that those potatoes were not commingled with production area potatoes. Procedures for safeguarding such repacking
of bulk loads within the production area would be specified in rules and regulations recommended by the committee
and approved by the Secretary through informal rulemaking. Damage to the industry would be eliminated by authorizing
requirements for accurate markings on containers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to accurate markings on containers, the committee should also have authority, with the approval of the
Secretary, to require accurate and adequate labeling, including the identification of the variety of potato. With
more new and different varieties being marketed each season, consumers would benefit from being apprised of the variety
in the container. Although variety labeling and use of the Idaho logo are currently a State program requirement of
the Idaho Potato Commission (Commission), this would not preclude the committee from issuing regulations concerning
marking and labeling for different varieties of potatoes. Such labeling would complement the Commission's potato
promotion program. In addition, the committee should have the option of issuing regulations for potatoes grown in
the Oregon portion of the production area. Such marking requirements could require the containers to be clearly marked
and identified with the variety of potatoes; net weight; count and/or volume; name and address of the packer or shipper;
origin of the potatoes; grade and size if applicable; and any other information on quality and pack of the potatoes
as may be recommended by the committee and approved by the Secretary through informal rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Clear markings also would enable the committee to more easily determine whether the potatoes have been inspected
and certified as required under the order. Comparison with inspection documents would be easier. This action is needed
to provide flexibility to meet current and future marketing problems. It is hereby recommended that &sect;945.52(a)
be amended by adding authority for container marking and labeling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Section 945.80 Reports should be amended, as proposed by the Fruit and Vegetable Division, AMS, by adding new paragraphs
(b) through (d) to assure confidentiality of information provided by handlers and to expressly state in the order
the right of the Secretary, and confer such right on the committee, to verify the accuracy of reports filed by handlers
and to check handler compliance with recordkeeping requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new &sect;945.80 (b) should be added to specify that confidential information provided to the committee would be
protected from disclosure. The section should specify that all data or other information constituting a trade secret
or disclosing a trade position or business condition shall be received by, and kept in the custody of, one or more designated
employees of the committee. Information which would reveal the circumstances of a single handler shall be disclosed
to no person other than the Secretary, except as provided by law. Under certain circumstances, the release of composite
information compiled from data and information submitted by handlers may be helpful to the committee in planning
operations under the order. Such composite information would not disclose the identities of the individual handlers
or their separate business operations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The record evidence indicates that the proposal on verification would merely specify in the order the investigative
authority already provided in the Act. Section 945.80 should be amended to specify that the Secretary and the committee,
through its duly authorized employees, would have access to any premises where handlers' potatoes are held and, at
any time during normal business hours, would be permitted to examine any such potatoes and any and all records with
respect to matters within the purview of the order. Handlers would be responsible for furnishing labor as may be necessary
to facilitate such examinations. The Secretary and duly authorized committee employees would thus explicitly have
the authority to examine and audit the records of all handlers to determine compliance with provisions of the order.
The committee would report the results of such examinations and audits to the Secretary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
So that the committee would be able to perform investigations effectively and to verify compliance under the order,
each handler should be required to maintain complete records which accurately show such handler's acquisition and
disposition of potatoes each season, including the quantity of potatoes held, sold, and shipped. Such information
is generally maintained by handlers in the normal course of business and maintenance of such records would not impose
additional costs and reporting burdens on the handlers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, should it be found necessary, the committee, with the approval of the Secretary, should have the authority
to issue regulations which would establish the types of records which must be maintained. Handlers would be required
to keep such records for at least two succeeding fiscal periods. This period should afford the committee's employees
adequate time to examine and review such records in the event of alleged program violations by handlers. This requirement
should not impose an undue burden on handlers, since such records are likely retained for a similar or longer period
under normal business practices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is hereby recommended that &sect;945.80 be amended by adding new paragraphs (b) through (d) as discussed above.

(1) The findings hereinafter set forth are supplementary to the previous findings and determinations which were
made in connection with the issuance of the marketing agreement and order and each previously issued amendment thereto.
Except insofar as such findings and determinations may be in conflict with the findings and determinations set forth
herein, all of the said prior findings and determinations are hereby ratified and affirmed; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The marketing agreement and order, as amended, and as hereby proposed to be further amended, and all of the terms
and conditions thereof, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The marketing agreement and order, as amended, and as hereby proposed to be further amended, regulate the handling
of potatoes grown in the production area in the same manner as, and are applicable only to, persons in the respective
classes of commercial and industrial activity specified in the marketing agreement and order upon which a hearing
has been held; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The marketing agreement and order, as amended, and as hereby proposed to be further amended, are limited in their
application to the smallest regional production area which is practicable, consistent with carrying out the declared
policy of the Act, and the issuance of several orders applicable to subdivisions of the production area would not effectively
carry out the declared policy of the Act; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) All handling of potatoes grown in the production area as defined in the marketing agreement and order, as amended,
and as hereby proposed to be further amended, is in the current of interstate or foreign commerce or directly burdens,
obstructs or affects such commerce.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing to amend the NRC's size standards used to qualify an NRC licensee
as a ``small entity'' under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The amendments would: establish a separate standard
to be used to determine whether a licensee who is a manufacturer would qualify as a small entity; and adjust the receipts-based
standard to account for the effects of inflation since 1985.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In 1983, the NRC surveyed its materials licensees to create an economic profile sufficient to consider regulatory
alternatives tailored to the size of the licensee. After analyzing the data and consulting with the Small Business
Administration (SBA), the NRC developed a proposed size standard that would be appropriate to use in determining
which of its licensees would qualify as small entities for the purposes of compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility
Act. The NRC published its proposed size standard for notice and comment in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of May 21, 1985 (50 FR 20913). After considering the comments received, the NRC adopted its final size standards as
noted in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of December 9, 1985 (50 FR 50241). In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 6, 1991 (56 FR 56671), the NRC restated the size standards to include the Regulatory Flexibility Act's
definition of small governmental jurisdiction. To further improve clarity, the NRC changed the presentation of
the size standards to conform to the listing of definitions of small entities in the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The size standards developed by the NRC were used in the NRC's final rule implementing Public Law 101&hyph;508 to provide
for a reduced annual fee for those NRC licensees who qualified as small entities under these standards (56 FR 31472;
July 10, 1991 and subsequent years). In response to these rules, the NRC has received a number of comments concerning
its size standards and the failure of the NRC to promulgate a size standard that differentiates between manufacturing
entities and service providers. These commenters indicated that applying a gross receipts standard to a manufacturing
concern resulted in an adverse impact on a manufacturer. The gross receipts of a service provider reflect the value
added by the service provider, which is essentially the value of the service itself. However, the gross receipts of
a manufacturer that are equal to those of a service provider reflect a smaller percentage of the value added by the manufacturer.
A manufacturer's gross receipts include the costs of the raw materials or components that, when added to the cost of
manufacture, quickly send a manufacturer's gross receipts into fairly sizeable sums. The SBA size standards for
manufacturers are prescribed in terms of a maximum number of employees rather than in terms of gross receipts.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC recently completed a survey to update the economic profile of its materials licensees. The purpose of this
survey was to evaluate the continued efficacy of NRC's current size standards and to obtain the information that is
necessary to determine the necessity and effect of a separate standard for manufacturers within the context of the
nuclear industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the licensees who responded to the survey request, approximately 20 percent (1131 of 5704) indicated that manufacturing
was a primary line of their business. This indicates that a number of licensees would benefit from the establishment
of a separate standard for businesses engaged in manufacturing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the NRC is proposing to adopt a size standard for business concerns that are manufacturing entities. The
NRC proposes to use a standard of 500 or fewer employees. This standard is the most commonly used SBA employee standard
and would be the standard applicable to the types of industries that would hold an NRC license. Under this standard,
approximately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
48 percent of the licensees who indicated that they were manufacturers would qualify as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 2, 1993 (58 FR 46573), SBA published a proposed rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that would have streamlined its size standards by reducing the number of its fixed size standard levels from 30 to 9.
As part of this proposed rule, the SBA proposed to adjust most of its receipts-based size standard levels to mitigate
the effects of inflation from 1984 to the present. In a final rule published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of April 7, 1994 (59 FR 16513), the SBA adopted only that portion of its proposed rule that increased its receipts-based
size standards as a result of inflation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC is proposing to adjust its receipts-based size standard to accommodate inflation and to conform to the SBA
final rule. The NRC proposes to raise its receipts-based small business size standard from $3.5 million to $5 million.
After analyzing the data received in response to the survey and the revised SBA size standards, the NRC also is proposing
to eliminate the separate $1 million size standard for private practice physicians and apply the revised receipts-based
size standard of $5 million to this class of licensees. This would mirror the revised SBA standard of $5 million for
medical practitioners. The survey of materials licensees indicates that 26 percent qualify as small entities under
current NRC standards. If the NRC adopts the proposed revisions to its size standards presented in this document,
35 percent of these licensees would qualify as small entities, an increase of 9 percent. When NRC adopted its size standards
in 1985, the NRC staff estimated that approximately 35 percent of the materials licensees would qualify as small entities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Small Business Credit and Business Opportunity Enhancement Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;366) amended the Small
Business Act concerning the establishment of agency specific small business size standards. The proposed NRC size
standards have been developed so as to meet the criteria specified in Pub. L. 102&hyph;366. The NRC has submitted these
proposed size standards for the review and approval of the Administrator, SBA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule also would codify NRC's size standards in Part 2 of the Commission's regulations. Previously,
NRC's size standards had been published in the notices section of the

Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC has determined that this proposed rule is the type of action described in categorical exclusion 10 CFR 51.22(c)(1).
Therefore, neither an environmental impact statement nor an environmental assessment has been prepared for this
proposed regulation.

Regulatory Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A regulatory analysis has not been prepared for this proposed rule because the proposed rule is administrative in
that it would amend the criteria the NRC uses for determining which of its licensees would qualify as small entities
for the purposes of compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The amended size standards would conform to SBA's
revised standards and result in an increase in the number of NRC licensees that would qualify as small entities.

Regulatory Flexibility Certification

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commission certifies that this rule, if
adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The proposed rule
is administrative in that it would amend the criteria the NRC uses in determining which of its licensees would qualify
as small entities for the purposes of compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The amended size standards
would conform to SBA's revised standards and result in an increase in the number of NRC licensees that would qualify
as small entities.

Backfit Analysis

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC has determined that the backfit rule, 10 CFR 50.109, does not apply to this proposed rule and, therefore, that
a backfit analysis is not required for this proposed rule because these amendments do not impose any provisions which
would impose backfits as defined in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(1).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 28, 1994 (59 FR 9429), NRC published for comment a proposed overall revision of the regulations applicable
to radiographic operations, 10 CFR Part 34. In an attempt to clarify the rule language and make the regulations more
compatible with Agreement State regulations governing industrial radiography, numerous changes to the regulation
were proposed. Included with the changes is a proposed amendment that would require licensees to ensure that individuals
acting as industrial radiographers, in addition to meeting other existing training and qualification requirements,
be certified through a radiation safety program by an NRC recognized certifying entity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The objective of this workshop is to attempt to resolve the remaining issues regarding radiographer certification
implementation, particularly issues concerning reciprocal recognition, information sharing, inspection and
enforcement activities, oversight of certifying entities, and multiple examinations. NRC also plans to discuss
certain changes made in the overall revision of Part 34 and modifications to the proposed rule that resulted from the
public comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Conduct of the Meeting: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The workshop will be co-chaired by Mr. Paul H. Lohaus, Deputy Director, Office of State Programs and Dr. John E. Glenn,
Chief, Medical, Academic, and Commercial Use Safety Branch, Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards. The
workshop will be conducted in a manner that will expedite the orderly conduct of business. A transcript of the workshop
will be available for inspection and copying for a fee at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW, [Lower Level],
Washington, DC 20555 on or about January 13, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Boeing Model 747&hyph;300
and &hyph;400 series airplanes equipped with certain stretched upper deck evacuation slides manufactured by BFGoodrich.
This proposal would require modification of the slide's main restraint strap, regulator assembly, and turbo fan
flapper retaining roll pins. This proposal is prompted by reports of loss of air pressure and non-inflation of the
inflatable tubes of the slide due to problems associated with the restraint strap, regulator assembly, and turbo
fan flapper retaining roll pins. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent loss of air pressure
or non-inflation of the inflatable tubes of the slide, which could impede the successful evacuation of passengers
from the airplane during an emergency.

Discussion

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has received reports of various problems involving BFGoodrich 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stretched upper deck evacuation slides, part number (P/N) 7A1323&hyph;(&blank;), installed on Boeing Model 747&hyph;300
and &hyph;400 series airplanes: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There have been several incidents in which the main restraint strap of the slide was ingested into one of the turbo fans.
This resulted in damage to the turbo fan and loss of air pressure in one tube of the slide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There have been two occurrences of the inflation system regulator shutting down due to internal pressure differentials.
These incidents resulted in non-inflation of one inflatable tube of the slide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There has been a report that, during deployment of the slide, the turbo fan flapper retaining roll pin broke, allowing
the flapper to fall out. This resulted in the loss of air pressure in the inflation tube. The cause of the broken pin was
determined to be the particular heat treatment used during manufacture of a certain lot of roll pins. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Loss of air pressure or non-inflation of the inflation tubes of an evacuation slide, if not corrected, could impede
the successful evacuation of passengers from the airplane during an emergency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved BFGoodrich Service Bulletin 7A1323&hyph;25&hyph;266, Revision 1, dated September
30, 1994, which describes procedures for the following modifications:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Relocating the slide's elastic cord ``bungee strap'' attachment point and shortening the elastic cord. This will
prevent the main restraint strap of the slide from being ingested into the turbo fan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Modifying and making other changes to the regulator assembly, such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modifying the regulator cartridge engagement sleeve by the addition of drilled holes to prevent the potential for
pressure differentials that could cause the regulator to shut down; installing a revised burst disk to prevent galling
when tightening the cartridge assembly; changing the type of lubricant to reduce friction forces; and installing
a new regulator release pin with a baked-on lubricant to provide a consistent release force. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Replacing the turbo fan flapper retaining roll pins. This will prevent breakage of the pins, thereby preventing
the possibility of the flapper falling out. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Replacing the original bottle relief valve assembly (P/N 5A2644&hyph;4) with a safety plug assembly (P/N 3A3259&hyph;3);
and adding a charge fitting on the reservoir safety plug assembly to allow for bottle charging after the modifications
described above have been accomplished. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would require modifying the stretched upper deck evacuation slide by relocating the elastic
cord ``bungee strap'' attachment point and shortening the elastic cord; modifying the regulator assembly; and replacing
the turbo fan flapper retaining roll pins. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the
service bulletin described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operators should note that this proposed AD is applicable to the manufacturer of the airplane model on which the evacuation
slides are installed, rather than to the manufacturer of the slide. The FAA's general policy is that, when an unsafe
condition results from the installation of an appliance or other item that is installed in only one particular make
and model of aircraft, the AD is issued so that it is applicable to the aircraft, rather than the item. The reason for
this is simple: Making the AD applicable to the airplane model on which the item is installed ensures that operators
of those airplanes will be notified directly of the unsafe condition and the action required to correct it. While it
is assumed that an operator will know the models of airplanes that it operates, there is a potential that the operator
will not know or be aware of specific items that are installed on its airplanes. Therefore, calling out the airplane
model as the subject of the AD prevents ``unknowing non-compliance'' on the part of the operator.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
(The FAA recognizes that there are situations when an unsafe condition exists in an item that is installed in many different
aircraft. In those cases, the FAA considers it impractical to issue AD's against each aircraft; in fact, many times,
the exact models and numbers of aircraft on which the item is installed may not be known. Therefore, in those situations,
the AD is issued so that it is applicable to the item; furthermore, those AD's usually indicate that the item is known
to be installed on, but not limited to, various aircraft models.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are approximately 900 BFGoodrich stretched upper deck evacuation slides of the affected design installed
on Boeing Model 747 series airplanes worldwide. The FAA estimates that 100 of these slides are installed on airplanes
of U.S. registry that would be affected by this proposed AD. It would take approximately 4.5 work hours per slide to
accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately
$1,402 per slide assembly. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated
to be $167,200, or $1,672 per slide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Schweizer Aircraft
Corporation and Hughes Helicopters, Inc. Model 269A, 269A&hyph;1, 269B, 269C, and TH&hyph;55A series helicopters
with certain main rotor (M/R) drive shafts installed, that currently requires a one-time radiographic inspection
or a non-destructive inspection of certain M/R drive shafts for cracks, distortion, corrosion, or other surface
damage, at specified time intervals or upon the occurrence of specified conditions. This action would require the
same inspections as the previous AD, but would expand the applicability of certain inspections to additional models
of the affected helicopters and would exclude certain M/R drive shafts from certain inspections. This proposal is
prompted by a reevaluation of the previous AD as a result of a comment suggesting the need to expand the applicability
of certain inspections to additional models of the affected helicopters and to exclude certain M/R drive shafts from
certain inspections. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent structural failure of the M/R
drive shaft, separation of the M/R from the helicopter, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter.

Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 13, 1993, the FAA issued AD 93&hyph;14&hyph;06, Amendment 39&hyph;8630 (58 FR 53120, October 14, 1993), to
require either a radiographic or a non-destructive inspection of certain main rotor (M/R) drive shafts for cracks,
distortion, corrosion, or other surface damage. That action was prompted by an accident resulting from a structural
failure of a drive shaft and reports of stress concentrations caused by deep manufacturing tooling marks on the inside
surface of the drive shaft. That condition, if not corrected, could result in structural failure of the M/R drive shaft,
separation of the M/R from the helicopter, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the issuance of that AD, a commenter states that the FAA incorrectly required inspections of replacement drive
shafts with serial number prefixes of ``SZ'' or ``ZS''. The drive shafts with serial numbers containing the ``SZ''
and ``ZS'' prefixes were excluded from the requirements of paragraph (a) of that AD and should have been excluded from
the requirements of paragraph (b), but were not. Also, in paragraph (a)(3) of the AD, the commenter states that the
FAA incorrectly limited the applicability of the inspection requirements to the Model 269C helicopter for inspection
of those M/R drive shafts with serial numbers S1112 and higher. It is the commenter's position that the inspection
required by paragraph (a)(3) should apply to all M/R drive shafts with serial numbers S1112 and higher installed on
any Model 269 series helicopters, and should not be limited to those installed on the Model 269C as was stated in that
AD. The FAA agrees with the commenter and is hereby proposing to supersede AD 93&hyph;14&hyph;06 to incorporate the
recommended changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other Schweizer Aircraft Corporation
and Hughes Helicopters, Inc. Model 269A, 269A&hyph;1, 269B, 269C, and TH&hyph;55A series helicopters of the same
type design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 93&hyph;14&hyph;06 to require a one-time radiographic inspection
or a non-destructive inspection of the applicable M/R drive shafts of all Model 269 series helicopters. The proposed
AD would also change paragraph (b) of AD 93&hyph;14&hyph;06 to exclude those replacement drive shafts having an ``SZ''
or ``ZS'' prefix from mandatory inspections prior to their installation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 1,364 helicopters of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take
approximately 10 work hours per helicopter to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is
$60 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to
be $818,400.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice proposes to establish Class E airspace areas at Quad-City Airport, Moline, IL, Capital Airport, Springfield,
IL, Kent County International Airport, Grand Rapids, MI, and Michiana Regional Transportation Center Airport,
South Bend, IN. Presently, these areas are designated as Class C airspace when the associated control towers are in
operation. However, controlled airspace to the surface is needed when the control towers located at these airports
are closed. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class E airspace for instrument flight rule
(IFR) operations when these control towers are closed.

The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class
E airspace at Moline, IL, Springfield, IL, Grand Rapids, MI, and South Bend, IN. Currently these airspace areas are
designated as Class C when the associated control towers are in operation. Nevertheless, controlled airspace to
the surface is needed for IFR operations at Quad-City Airport, Moline, IL, Capital Airport, Springfield, IL, Kent
County International Airport, Grand Rapids, MI, and Michiana Regional Transportation Center Airport, South Bend,
IN, when the control towers are closed. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class E airspace
for IFR operations at these airports when these control towers are closed.

surface areas for airports are published in Paragraph 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective

The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify the Class

The intended effect of this action is to provide segregation of aircraft using instrument approach procedures in

would reflect the defined area which would enable pilots to circumnavigate the area in order to comply with applicable
visual flight rules requirements.

The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations are published
in Paragraph 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Kelly Products, Inc., P.O. Box 1508, 4132 Highway 278, NW., Covington, GA 30209, submitted pesticide petition (PP)
4E4348 to EPA requesting that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (FFDCA) (21 U.S.C. 346a(e)), propose to amend 40 CFR 180.1001(c) by establishing an exemption from the requirement
of a tolerance for residues of acrylamide-potassium acrylate-acrylic acid copolymer, cross-linked (CAS Reg. No.
31212-13-2), when used as an inert ingredient (carrier) in pesticide formulations applied to growing crops or to
raw agricultural commodities after harvest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 153.125, and include, but
are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own):
solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers
such as clay and diatomaceous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting, spreading,
and dispersing agents; propellants in aerosol dispensers; microencapsulating agents; and emulsifiers. The term
``inert'' is not to imply nontoxicity; the ingredient may or may not be chemically active.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated. As part of the EPA policy statement
on inert ingredients published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of April 22, 1987 (52 FR 13305), the Agency set forth a list of studies which would generally be used to evaluate the risks
posed by the presence of an inert ingredient in a pesticide formulation. However, where it can be determined without
that data that the inert ingredient will present minimal or no risk, the Agency generally does not require some or all
of the listed studies to rule on the proposed tolerance or exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for an inert
ingredient. The Agency has decided that no data, in addition to that described below, for acrylamide-potassium acrylate-acrylic
acid copolymer, crosslinked, will need to be submitted. The rationale for this decision is described below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of certain chemical substances that are defined as ``polymers,'' the Agency has established a set of criteria
which identify categories of polymers that present low risk. These criteria (described in 40 CFR 723.250) identify
polymers that are relatively unreactive and stable compared to other chemical substances as well as polymers that
typically are not readily absorbed. These properties generally limit a polymer's ability to cause adverse effects.
In addition, these criteria exclude polymers about which little is known. The Agency believes that polymers meeting
the criteria noted above will present minimal or no risk. Acrylamide-potassium acrylate-acrylic acid copolymer,
cross-linked, conforms to the definition of a polymer in 40 CFR 723.250(b)(11) and meets the following criteria that
are used to identify low-risk polymers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The minimum number-average molecular weight of acrylamide-potassium acrylate-acrylic acid copolymer, crosslinked,
is estimated to be approximately 1,000,000. Substances with molecular weights greater than 400 generally are not
absorbed through the intact skin, and substances with molecular weights greater than 1,000 generally are not absorbed
through the intact gastrointestinal tract. Chemicals not absorbed through skin or GI tract generally are incapable
of eliciting a toxic response.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Acrylamide-potassium acrylate-acrylic acid copolymer, cross-linked, is not a cationic polymer, nor is it reasonably
expected to become a cationic polymer in a natural aquatic environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Acrylamide-potassium acrylate-acrylic acid copolymer, cross-linked, does not contain less than 32.0 percent
by weight of the atomic element carbon.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Acrylamide-potassium acrylate-acrylic acid copolymer, cross-linked, contains as an integral part of its coposition
the atomic elements carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Acrylamide-potassium acrylate-acrylic acid copolymer, cross-linked, does not contain as an integral part of
its composition, except as impurities, any elements other than those listed in 40 CFR 723.250(d)(3)(ii).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Acrylamide-potassium acrylate-acrylic acid copolymer, cross-linked, is not a biopolymer, a synthetic equivalent
of a biopolymer, or a dervative or modification of a biopolymer that is substantially intact.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Acrylamide-potassium acrylate-acrylic acid copolymer, cross-linked, is not manufactured from reactants containing,
other than impurities, halogen atoms or cyano groups.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Acrylamide-potassium acrylate-acrylic acid copolymer, cross-linked, does not contain a reactive functional
group that is intended or reasonably expected to undergo further reaction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Acrylamide-potassium acrylate-acrylic acid copolymer, cross-linked, is neither designed nor reasonably expected
to substantially degrade, decompose, or depolymerize.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the information above and review of its use, EPA has found that, when used in accordance with good agricultural
practice, this ingredient is useful, and a tolerance is not necessary to protect the public health. Therefore, EPA
proposes that the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance be established as set forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide, under the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended, that contains any of the ingredients listed herein, may request

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 2 of Executive Order 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirement of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the
Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have an economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
A certification statement to this effect was published in the

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This Notice of Proposed Rule Making (Notice) proposes to open for commercial development and use a portion of the ``millimeter
wave'' frequency bands above 40 GHz. This proposal is necessary because the existing FCC rules generally do not permit
operation above 40 GHz. Recent advances in technology indicate that commercial use of these frequencies is feasible.
The Commission believes the proposals set forth in the

This is a summary of the Commission's Notice of Proposed Rule Making in ET Docket No. 94&hyph;124, FCC 94&hyph;273,
adopted October 20, 1994, and released November 8, 1994. The full text of this decision is available for inspection
and copying during normal business hours in the FCC Dockets Branch (Room 230), 1919 M Street, N.W., Washington, DC.
The complete text of this decision also may be purchased from the Commission's duplicating contractor, International
Transcription Services, Inc., at (202) 857&hyph;3800, 2100 M Street, N.W., Suite 140, Washington, DC 20037.

Synopsis of Notice of Proposed Rule Making
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Commission is proposing to open for commercial development and use a portion of the millimeter wave frequency
bands above 40 GHz. In particular, the Commission proposes to make available a total of 16 GHz of spectrum in the frequency
range between 47.2 and 153 GHz on a shared basis with existing and future government users. The Commission also proposes
to make available 2 GHz of Spectrum in the 40.5&hyph;42.5 GHz band for non-government users.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. These new frequency bands will permit the development of short-range wireless radio systems with communications
capacities approaching that now achievable only with coaxial and optical fiber cable. Such systems could support
many short-range applications that require very high bandwidth or data transfer rates. Uses could include applications
involving the National Information Infrastructure (NII); educational or medical applications such as remote wireless
access to libraries or other informational databases; and non-communications uses such as automobile radar systems
to avoid collisions. The proposed rules provide for the operation of such systems on both a licensed and an unlicensed
basis. The Commission is also proposing technical standards for millimeter wave band equipment and operation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. All of the spectrum above 40 GHz, with the exception of the 40.5&hyph;42.5 GHz band, several Amateur Radio Service
allocations, and a Government satellite allocation, is allocated on a shared basis to government and non-government
use, and most of the bands that the Commission is proposing to open for commercial use will continue to be available
for existing and future government use. Thus, in cooperation with the Department of Commerce's National Telecommunications
Information Administration (NTIA), the Commission is proposing twelve frequency bands in the region of the spectrum
from 47 GHz to 153 GHz for potential use by new millimeter wave technologies. These frequency bands are: 47.2&hyph;48.2
GHz, 59.0&hyph;64.0 GHz, 71.0&hyph;72.0 GHz, 76.0&hyph;77.0 GHz, 84.0&hyph;85.0 GHz, 94.7&hyph;95.7 GHz, 103.0&hyph;104.0
GHz, 116.0&hyph;117.0 GHz, 122.0&hyph;123.0 GHz, 126.0&hyph;127.0 GHz, 139.0&hyph;140.0 GHz, and 152.0&hyph;153.0
GHz. The Commission is also proposing to permit commercial use in the 40.5&hyph;42.5 GHz band which is already allocated
entirely to nongovernment use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The Commission is tentatively proposing an approximately even division of available spectrum between licensed
and unlicensed users, with unlicensed users further divided between general unlicensed devices and unlicensed
vehicular radar systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The extremely limited propagation range of the 59&hyph;64 GHz-band, as well as higher millimeter wave frequency
bands, suggests that major portions of those bands be designated for general use by unlicensed devices. Therefore,
the Commission is proposing to provide the following frequency bands for unlicensed operations under Part 15 of our
rules: 59&hyph;64 GHz, 71.5&hyph;72.0 GHz, 84.5&hyph;85.0 GHz, 103.5&hyph;104.0 GHz, 116.5&hyph;117.0 GHz,
122.5&hyph;123.0 GHz, 126.5&hyph;127.0 GHz, and 152.5&hyph;153.0 GHz. This would provide 3.5 GHz in seven of the
frequency bands and 5 GHz in an eighth band, for a total of 8.5 GHz for general unlicensed operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Based on the demand for licensed services below 40 GHz, the Commission is proposing to designate all of the 40.5&hyph;42.5
GHz band and virtually all of the 47.2&hyph;48.2 GHz band for licensed use, except for a small portion that would be
designated for vehicular radar use. Similarly, the Commission is proposing that portions of the bands above 64 GHz
that are not designated for vehicular radar use be designated for licensed use. In particular, the Commission is proposing
to provide spectrum for licensed services in each of the following bands: 40.5&hyph;42.5 GHz, 47.4&hyph;48.2 GHz,
71.0&hyph;71.5 GHz, 84.0&hyph;84.5 GHz, 103.0&hyph;103.5 GHz, 116.0&hyph;116.5 GHz, 122.0&hyph;122.5 GHz,
126.0&hyph;126.5 GHz and 152.0&hyph;152.5 GHz. The

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The Commission is proposing to designate three of the millimeter wave bands, as well as part of the fourth band, for
use by vehicular radar systems. These bands are: 47.2&hyph;47.4 GHz, 76.0&hyph;77.0 GHz, 94.7&hyph;95.7 GHz, and
139.0&hyph;140.0 GHz.

9. Pursuant to applicable procedures set forth in Sections 1.415 and 1.419 of the Commission's Rules, 47 CFR Sections
1.415 and 1.419, interested parties may file comments on or before January 30, 1995 and reply comments on or before
March 1, 1995. To file formally in this proceeding, you must file an original and four copies of all comments, reply
comments, and supporting comments. If you want each Commissioner to receive a personal copy of your comments, you
must file an original plus nine copies. You should send comments and reply comments to Office of the Secretary, Federal
Communications Commission, Washington, D.C. 20554. Comments and reply comments will be available for public inspection
during regular business hours in the FCC Reference Center, Room 239, 1919 M Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20554.

(b) On any frequency or frequencies above 1000 MHz, unless otherwise stated, the radiated limits shown are based on
the use of measurement instrumentation employing an average detector functions. When average radiated emission
measurements are specified in the regulations, including emission measurements below 1000 MHz, there is also a limit
on the radio frequency emissions, as measured using instrumentation with a peak detector function, corresponding
to 20 dB above the maximum permitted average limit for the frequency being investigated. Unless otherwise specified,
measurements above 1000 MHz shall be performed using a minimum resolution bandwidth of 1 MHz. Measurements of AC power
line conducted emissions are performed using a CISPR quasi-peak detector, even for devices for which average radiated
emission measurements are specified.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule would establish new procedures and requirements for testing and evaluation of products MSHA approves
for use in underground mines. It would require manufacturers of certain products who seek MSHA approval to use an independent
laboratory recognized by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) as a Nationally Recognized Testing
Laboratory (NRTL) to perform the necessary testing and evaluation for approval. The NRTL would conduct the product
testing and evaluation currently done by the Agency according to the appropriate MSHA testing and evaluation requirements.
The proposed rule would revise MSHA's testing and evaluation responsibilities and allow the Agency to expand its
post-approval product audit program and pursue the evaluation of new and safer technology as applied to underground
mining products. The proposal would also enable the Agency, upon an applicant's request, to approve products based
upon testing and evaluation requirements other than MSHA's, provided that the alternative requirements are equivalent
to MSHA's requirements and provide at least the same measure of protection for the miner. The proposed rule would increase
the availability of a wider variety of mining products having enhanced safety components by reducing costs and broadening
the market for mining equipment. Conforming amendments to some parts of MSHA's approval regulations are also being
proposed as part of this rulemaking.

I. Paperwork Reduction Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal contains information collection requirements in paragraphs (a), (e), and (f) of &sect;6.10. These
paperwork requirements have been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under section
3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, when manufacturers seek to have MSHA test and evaluate a product they must supply MSHA with the necessary
documentation. Under the proposed rule, manufacturers would still need to produce this documentation. Thus, the
manufacturers' burden hours related to developing documentation needed to perform tests and evaluations would
not change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed &sect;6.10(a), in order for MSHA to issue an approval to a manufacturer, MSHA would need to review a
copy of the NRTL's test and evaluation results along with the NRTL's statement of product compliance with MSHA requirements.
MSHA anticipates that most manufacturers would request two copies of the test and evaluation results and statement
of product compliance from the NRTL and forward one set to MSHA along with the application for approval of its product.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, MSHA spends about 14,750 staff hours testing and evaluating products. The actual duration of the testing
and evaluation varies significantly from product to product. MSHA expects that the NRTLs would spend about the same
amount of time. Absent an MSHA regulation requiring approval of products for underground mines, MSHA estimates that
at least 10 percent of manufacturers would still have their products tested and evaluated by an independent laboratory
to make them more acceptable to the mining industry. Thus, MSHA estimates that about 13,275 paperwork burden hours
per year would be associated with generating the NRTL test and evaluation records that would be required under the
proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed &sect;6.10(e), an NRTL would make available for MSHA review internal audits of the NRTL conducted
as a part of its internal audit program to assure that the required procedures, controls, and practices are in place.
NRTLs recognized by OSHA currently are required to do internal audits and verify that they were done and, as a result,
already maintain the necessary records to verify that such audits are performed. Thus, there are no paperwork burden
hours associated with &sect;6.10(e).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Also, under proposed &sect;6.10(f), NRTLs must make available for MSHA review the results of their field audit (follow-up)
programs. This includes reports of factory inspections of manufacturers whose products the NRTL is testing and evaluating
and any field audits of products to monitor and ensure the proper use of the NRTL's mark. In addition, the NRTL must notify
MSHA expeditiously, for example by telephone or by fax, and send the Agency any necessary documentation when audits
reveal nonconformities in products issued an MSHA approval. Because NRTLs currently maintain records of audits
performed on products as a normal business practice, there are no paperwork burden hours related to maintaining such
records. However, as a result of the proposed rule, the NRTLs would have to notify and send necessary documentation
to MSHA when audits reveal nonconformities in approved products. MSHA estimated that NRTLs would find product nonconformities
in about 12 percent of audits, and it would take an NRTL about 30 minutes to notify and send MSHA the necessary documentation.
In FY 1993, MSHA audited 709 units of approved products. Thus, the associated burden hours are estimated to be about
43 hours.

including suggestions for reducing these burdens, should be sent to Patricia W. Silvey, Director, Office of Standards,

II. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
From its creation by Congress in 1910, MSHA's predecessor, the Bureau of Mines, Department of the Interior (Bureau),
was responsible for the testing and evaluation of mining products. Under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of
1977 (Mine Act), MSHA is responsible for prescribing the technical design, construction, and test requirements
for certain products used in underground mines, and for testing and evaluating them for approval based on those requirements.
These technical requirements are set forth in the Agency's approval regulations in 30 CFR parts 7 through 36. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MSHA's approval regulations govern the process through which manufacturers may obtain MSHA approval, certification,
acceptance or evaluation of certain products for use in underground mines. Each of these separate approval actions
has specific application procedures and technical requirements for testing and evaluation. MSHA currently conducts
the testing and evaluation of products for a fee paid by the applicant. Following MSHA approval, manufacturers must
ensure that the product continues to conform to the technical requirements tested, evaluated, and approved by MSHA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When MSHA receives an application for approval of a product for use in underground mines, every aspect of the documentation
package is scrutinized to determine whether the technical requirements of the applicable provisions of 30 CFR parts
15 through 36 have been met. Each drawing and specification in the package is cross-checked against these requirements
and, for some products, samples of the product or parts of the product are disassembled and examined by MSHA for conformity
with the drawings and specifications. After MSHA verifies that an applicant's product complies with the design and
construction requirements, MSHA then tests the product to determine whether it performs according to the approval
requirements, unless the design obviates the need for testing. If the product passes the tests and meets all MSHA requirements,
MSHA issues an approval for the product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once MSHA has approved a product, the manufacturer is authorized to place an MSHA approval marking on the product that
identifies it as approved for use in underground mines. Use of the MSHA marking obligates the manufacturer to maintain
the quality of the product as approved. The MSHA marking indicates to the mining community that the product has been
manufactured according to the drawings and specifications upon which the approval was based. Any proposed change
to an approved product that causes it to differ from the design or construction described in the original documentation
approved by MSHA must be submitted to the Agency for approval prior to implementation of the change. If MSHA approves
the change, the Agency issues an extension of approval or a notice of acceptance of the modified product to the manufacturer.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
About 10 years ago, the Agency reviewed its product approval program to determine if it could be restructured to provide
improved safety to miners without increasing the level of resources expended. That review resulted in the promulgation
in 1988 of 30 CFR part 7, Applicant or Third-Party Testing, which represented MSHA's first departure from its role
of front-end prototype testing of products for approval by substituting manufacturer or third-party testing of
a limited number of products for the testing that previously had been conducted by MSHA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The objectives of the program were to permit MSHA to redirect its resources to its post-approval product audit functions,
as well as to the review of technological improvements in mining products. The Agency made this shift in emphasis to
enhance the safety of products in mines by providing the mining community a greater assurance that approved products
in mines continue to be manufactured as approved, by detecting any defective products more effectively, and by enabling
a more expeditious introduction of new technology. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Products selected as suitable for applicant or third-party testing under part 7 were those with characteristics
which could be objectively tested in a routine and readily reproducible manner, with no elements of subjective analysis.
Products whose testing results depend on the experience, judgment, and knowledge of the personnel executing the
tests, such as testing a complex intrinsically safe circuit, were not included in the part 7 program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under part 7, all product testing is conducted according to MSHA-specified tests and procedures, using calibrated
and accurate instruments. Moreover, the product testing is subject to Agency observation or witnessing. Part 7 is
not a self-certification program. The part 7 concept shifts only the testing of certain products to the applicant
or a third party. The evaluation of the test results and the issuance of the approval remain the responsibility of the
Agency. Under this proposal, part 7 would not be changed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1993, as part of President Clinton's National Performance Review, MSHA initiated a further review of its approval
and certification activities, including its part 7 applicant or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third-party testing program. Based on this review, the Agency reaffirmed the objectives of the part 7 concept to increase
post-approval product audits and direct more resources to evaluation of safety and technological improvements
in products for use underground. However, MSHA determined that while the part 7 program was a step in the right direction,
the limited scope of that program did not free up sufficient resources to allow MSHA to fully redirect its efforts to
meet those objectives. After considering how best to accomplish those goals, the Agency has decided to initiate rulemaking
to modify MSHA's approval program in two ways. First, applicants seeking MSHA product approval would be required
to use independent laboratories for the required testing and evaluation. This would be in lieu of MSHA testing and
evaluation of products. As with the part 7 program, however, MSHA would continue to verify that approval requirements
were met and would retain full responsibility for issuing the product approval. Thus, this proposed modified approach
would not constitute a self-certification program. Second, MSHA or appropriately recognized independent laboratories
would be permitted, upon an applicant's request, to test and evaluate a product for approval based on approval requirements
other than the Agency's, as long as those requirements provide an equal or greater degree of protection. This would
allow MSHA to approve a product meeting the International Electrotechnical Commission's (IEC) approval standards,
or some other approval requirements different from those specified in MSHA's regulations, provided that MSHA had
determined previously that those requirements were equivalent or could be enhanced to provide protection equivalent
to that afforded by products tested and evaluated according to MSHA approval requirements. In this way, the Agency
could take advantage of revisions to product approval standards developed by other countries or standards development
organizations to address technological advances or improvements in product safety. Such an approach would permit
the introduction of a wider variety of improved products into U.S. mines more quickly than if the Agency had to undertake
rulemaking to address each technological advance or improvement in product safety, capability, and performance.

III. Discussion of Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 6.10&blank;Use of Independent Laboratories 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule, which would require applicants to use independent laboratories to perform the product testing
and evaluation necessary for issuance of MSHA's product approval, is intended to form the foundation of a modified
approval program providing enhanced product user protection and more rapid introduction of new technology into
the mining industry. This modified approval program would require applicants for product approval to submit to MSHA,
along with their application and product drawings and specifications, the test and evaluation data and results developed
by a qualified independent laboratory in addition to the laboratory's statement of product conformance with MSHA
testing and evaluation requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In deciding to propose such a modification to its approval program, the Agency concluded that it was essential for
the laboratories performing testing and evaluation to be recognized under some type of accreditation program. The
existence of three accreditation programs administered by the U.S. Government led MSHA to decide to use one of these
programs rather than establish its own program and duplicate the work of others. The three programs considered were:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) National Voluntary Conformity Assessment System
Evaluation (NV CASE) program, 15 CFR part 286; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) NIST's National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NV LAP), 15 CFR part 285; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory Program
(NRTL), 29 CFR 1910.7. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NV CASE program became effective on May 23, 1994. As of July 1994, NIST had received only one letter expressing possible
interest in establishing a specific program under NV CASE. Therefore, no organization which determines the conformity
of products to technical regulations based on testing and evaluation; i.e., a conformity assessment body, has yet
been accredited by NIST under the NV CASE program. Moreover, as indicated by NIST in the preamble to the final rule for
NV CASE, the program was intended to assist U.S. manufacturers in demonstrating that their products meet other countries'
technical requirements for export purposes. Accrediting an organization to determine the conformity of products
with domestic regulatory requirements, such as MSHA's product approval regulations, was specifically stated to
be outside the scope of the NV CASE program. Therefore, NV CASE is not suitable for MSHA's purposes in this rulemaking.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After comparing the other two programs, NIST's NV LAP and OSHA's NRTL, MSHA has selected the OSHA Nationally Recognized
Testing Laboratory program as the appropriate platform by which private sector, independent laboratories could
provide prototype testing and evaluation of products for use in mines. The Agency has chosen the OSHA program over
the NIST NV LAP program for several reasons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, in order for a laboratory to become recognized or accredited as an NRTL under OSHA's program, the laboratory
must be independent; i.e., free from influence by manufacturers whose products it tests and evaluates, by vendors
and suppliers, and by employers using approved products. This independence does not exist under NIST's NV LAP program
to accredit calibration and testing laboratories because manufacturers' in-house laboratories are eligible to
receive accreditation. Independence of the testing laboratory from the manufacturer is essential for MSHA and the
public to have confidence in testing and evaluation conducted outside its Approval and Certification Center. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the OSHA NRTL accreditation signifies that the independent laboratory has the capability (including proper
testing equipment and facilities, trained staff, written testing procedures, and calibration and quality control
programs) to perform testing and evaluation of products to determine compliance with specified design, construction,
or test requirements. An NRTL does more than just test products. One key feature distinguishing an NRTL from a testing
house, such as one accredited by NIST under NV LAP, is its ability to evaluate products during production to ensure
that the products conform to technical standards. The term ``evaluation'' means the systematic examination of the
extent to which a product fulfills specified requirements. Thus, an NRTL must be qualified both to test products to
specific standards and to certify, after evaluation, that the products meet applicable requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, an important factor in MSHA's decision to use laboratories accredited by OSHA is the requirement that NRTLs
maintain oversight of products they test, evaluate, and certify and which carry the NRTL's marking. One of the goals
of MSHA's modified approval proposal is to provide greater assurance that products actually in service in underground
mines are manufactured as approved. OSHA's program, which mandates organized product ``follow-up,'' would provide
this assurance. This ``follow-up'' program serves three functions. It (1) implements control procedures for identifying
listed or labeled products; (2) to the extent necessary, conducts production line inspections to ensure conformance
with test and evaluation standards; and (3) to the extent necessary, initiates post-marketing field inspections
to ensure that the product continues to meet the test standards and requirements. Laboratories accredited under
the NV LAP program, because they only test and do not evaluate product compliance, are not required to conduct product
auditing functions such as those an NRTL must perform. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OSHA procedures for recognizing Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratories are set forth in Appendix A to 29
CFR 1910.7. (See 53 FR 12123, April 12, 1988.) This appendix provides requirements and criteria which OSHA uses to
evaluate and recognize an NRTL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Appendix A, each applicant for accreditation as an NRTL must list the specific test standards it intends to use.
OSHA then evaluates the laboratory's capabilities based on the list and an on-site review by an assessment team. As
a part of the accreditation process, the assessment team visits the applicant laboratory to verify its capabilities,
including facilities, test equipment, calibration program, product handling procedures, product evaluation
procedures, test procedures, technical reports, technical records, test standards, quality assurance program,
internal audits, complaint resolution procedures, follow-up program for manufacturers, personnel programs,
and other procedures for producing credible findings and objective, unbiased reports. Since the inception of the
OSHA program in 1988, MSHA has assisted OSHA in assessing the capability of applicant laboratories to fulfill the
requirements of the NRTL program. In this cooperative effort, MSHA personnel brought to the OSHA program broad experience
in test procedures and conformity assessment of products to technical requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reviewing a laboratory's application and capabilities, OSHA makes a preliminary decision to grant or deny
the application. This decision is published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for comment. After the comment period, which must be at least 60 days, the validity of any comments received is evaluated.
These evaluations are used to help determine whether the applicant has met the criteria for accreditation. Upon approval,
a final announcement is published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 outlining the scope of the recognition and any conditions that apply to the newly-recognized NRTL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each recognition lasts for 5 years. During that time, OSHA exercises oversight to assess conformance of the NRTL with
the terms of its accreditation. Unresolved issues or discrepancies could result in withdrawal of the NRTL recognition.
At the present time, twelve laboratories are accredited by OSHA under its NRTL program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Foreign laboratories also may apply for NRTL accreditation. In determining eligibility for a foreign-based testing
agency or organization, however, OSHA takes into consideration the policy of the foreign government regarding both
the acceptance in that country of testing, data, equipment acceptances, and listings and labeling, which are provided
through nationally recognized testing laboratories recognized by the Assistant Secretary for OSHA, and the accessibility
to government recognition or a similar system in that country by U.S.-based, safety-related testing agencies, whether
recognized by the Assistant Secretary or not, if such recognition or a similar system is required by that country.
Presently, one foreign laboratory has been recognized by OSHA as an NRTL. That laboratory is the Canadian Standards
Association (CSA).

Under the proposal, this part would establish the procedures and requirements for independent laboratories to perform
testing and evaluation for MSHA product approval. It also would authorize MSHA, when requested by an applicant for
product approval, to approve a product based on testing and evaluation requirements other than those set forth in
MSHA product approval regulations if the other requirements are equivalent to MSHA's or can be enhanced to provide
at least the same degree of protection as MSHA's requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions of this part would apply to all applications for approval and extensions of approval except those filed
under 30 CFR parts 7, 31, 32, and 36 received by MSHA after [insert the effective date of this rule]. However, MSHA recognizes
that it may take some time before there are NRTLs accredited by OSHA to perform testing and evaluation to all the various
MSHA product approval regulations. Until such time as an NRTL has been recognized to perform the necessary testing
and evaluation for a particular product, MSHA would continue to perform the required testing and evaluation for that
product for approval purposes. Once an NRTL is recognized to perform the required tests and evaluations for a given
product, however, the manufacturer would be required to have the necessary testing and evaluation conducted by an
NRTL recognized by OSHA to perform those specific tests and evaluations and to submit the testing and evaluation results
and the statement of product compliance along with its application for approval or extension of approval. Thus, for
example, if an NRTL had been recognized by OSHA to perform the testing and evaluation of hose conduit for approval under
30 CFR part 18, then the manufacturer would be required to use an NRTL to perform those tests and evaluations for an approval
or extension of approval and submit the results to MSHA as part of its application. On the other hand, if no NRTL had been
accredited to perform the hose conduit testing and evaluation, MSHA would continue to perform the testing and evaluation
required for product approval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If only one NRTL is accredited to perform the necessary testing and evaluation for a particular product, the manufacturer
would have to use that NRTL to conduct the requisite testing and evaluation work. Where more than one NRTL has been recognized,
manufacturers would have a choice as to which NRTL would perform the work.

This term would be used to describe a written document issued by MSHA which states that a product has met the requirements
of part 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 26, 27, 29, 33, or 35. It would not apply to the provisions of 30 CFR part 7. The definition
would be based on the existing definitions of ``approval'' in the parts specified above. It would be expanded to include
``certification'' and ``acceptance'' because these terms also are used to denote MSHA approval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;6.10(a) would require the applicant seeking MSHA product approval under part 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23,
26, 27, 29, 33, or 35 to provide, as a part of its application, documentation of the testing and evaluation necessary
to ensure compliance with MSHA requirements. Such testing and evaluation would be performed by an independent laboratory
that has been accredited by OSHA as a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory and has demonstrated its capability
to perform the specific testing and evaluation required by MSHA for the product for which approval is sought.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To implement this proposed rule, MSHA and OSHA intend to expand by a subagreement the 1979 Interagency Agreement between
MSHA and OSHA which provides for interagency coordination to develop compatible safety and health standards, regulations,
and policies with respect to the mutual goals of the two organizations. That subagreement would include specific
provisions for detailing the coordination between the two agencies with respect to the NRTL program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to become accredited under OSHA's NRTL program to perform MSHA testing and evaluation, a laboratory would
have to submit an application to OSHA which provides sufficient information and detail demonstrating that it meets
the requirements set forth in 29 CFR 1910.7. As part of its application, the laboratory also would identify the scope
of the NRTL-related activity for which it seeks recognition. This would include identifying those specific testing
and evaluation methods set forth in MSHA product approval regulations that the laboratory would use to test and evaluate
the product being submitted for MSHA approval. Based on pre-rulemaking discussions between MSHA and OSHA, the Assistant
Secretary for OSHA would consider MSHA testing and evaluation requirements set out in 30 CFR parts 18, 19, 20, 21, 22,
23, 26, 27, 29, 33, and 35, or other testing and evaluation requirements which MSHA determines under 30 CFR 6.20 are
equivalent to the requirements in those approval parts, to be ``alternative test standards'' as defined in 29 CFR
1910.7(d), which provide an ``adequate level of safety'' for products to be used in gassy underground mines. However,
unless otherwise specifically indicated by OSHA, the MSHA testing and evaluation requirements considered as ``alternative
test standards'' shall not be used to test and evaluate products for use in workplaces other than gassy underground
mines subject to MSHA jurisdiction under the Mine Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under OSHA's Appendix A to &sect;1910.7, an on-site assessment of the testing facilities of the applicant laboratory,
as well as its administrative and technical practices, would then be conducted by OSHA. The assessment team selected
to evaluate the capabilities of the laboratory desiring to test to MSHA approval requirements would be a joint OSHA/MSHA
group, including MSHA personnel skilled in the details of MSHA testing and evaluation requirements. Although under
its regulation OSHA has the authority to contract with outside personnel to perform the on-site assessment, OSHA
has agreed that this critical responsibility would not be contracted out to private sector personnel for evaluating
applicant laboratories seeking recognition to perform MSHA testing and evaluation. The subagreement to the Interagency
Agreement between MSHA and OSHA would specifically eliminate this option for the MSHA program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the Assistant Secretary for OSHA who has the authority to grant recognition to an NRTL or to expand, renew, or revoke
such recognition. However, MSHA staff would participate in all aspects of the process for determining whether an
application for recognition of an NRTL to perform testing and evaluation for MSHA product approval should be approved.
This would include preparation of written reports of on-site assessment, review of any public comments received
regarding the laboratory's application for accreditation, and participation in any special review or informal
hearing ordered by the Assistant Secretary for OSHA to address public objection to an applicant's request for recognition
by OSHA. MSHA personnel also would participate fully in any action to expand, renew, or revoke recognition of an NRTL
to perform the testing and evaluation necessary under MSHA's product approval regulations. In this manner, MSHA
would be assured that the applicant laboratory is capable and has complete understanding of the testing and evaluation
requirements, procedures, and protocol specified in MSHA's product approval regulations. All these areas of MSHA
participation in the OSHA process to accredit an NRTL to perform MSHA testing and evaluation would be delineated in
the subagreement between the agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required under this paragraph (a) of the proposed rule, once an NRTL has been recognized by OSHA to perform testing
and evaluation for MSHA approval of a particular product, the manufacturer seeking approval of that product must
submit to MSHA, as part of its application, the NRTL testing and evaluation results along with a statement of product
compliance with the applicable MSHA approval requirements. It is at this point that the MSHA review process would
begin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MSHA would initiate an administrative review of the application package upon receipt to ensure that the applicant
had included all of the necessary information to process the application. This information would include, among
other things, a complete description of the product, product drawings and specifications, the NRTL product testing
and evaluation results, the NRTL statement of product compliance with the applicable MSHA approval requirements,
and payment of the nonrefundable MSHA application fee. If the manufacturer has submitted an incomplete application
package without all the information required, MSHA immediately would notify the applicant of the deficiency by mail.
MSHA would then hold the deficient application for a reasonable period of time, without further processing, while
awaiting a response from the manufacturer. If the applicant fails to respond to the MSHA request for additional information
to complete the application package within a reasonable time, MSHA would cancel the application and the applicant
would forfeit the application fee. Applications submitted without the required application fee would be considered
invalid.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After determining that an application package is complete, MSHA would initiate a technical review to ensure that
the NRTL testing and evaluation results were both reasonable and appropriate for the particular product. If technical
review of the package indicates deficiencies resulting from inadequate data, illogical or unreasonable testing
or evaluation results, or the omission of required information, the applicant would be notified of the discrepancy
and given a reasonable period of time to provide the needed information and/or explain the apparent deficiency. Failure
to respond to the MSHA notification of a discrepant application with the required information and/or satisfactory
explanations within a reasonable period would result in cancellation of the application and forfeiture of the application
fee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following the administrative and technical review of the product application package, MSHA would issue an approval,
or notice denying approval, to the applicant. A notice denying approval would state the reasons upon which the denial
was based. If an approval is issued, the approval holder is authorized and required to place an MSHA marking on the product
which signifies to the user of the product that the product is approved for use in gassy underground mines. The product
drawings and specifications, the NRTL testing and evaluation results, and the NRTL statement of product compliance
with the applicable approval requirements would be retained in an approval file. The MSHA approval constitutes a
license which authorizes the approval holder to manufacture, distribute, and sell the product constructed in exact
accordance with the approval documentation on file with MSHA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;6.10(b) would require that NRTL testing and evaluation of products for MSHA approval be performed
only by NRTLs accredited by OSHA to perform the specific MSHA tests and evaluations. Because of the critical nature
of the testing and evaluation of products to be used in the underground mining environment, where hazards such as flammable
methane gas may exist, the proposal would not permit the NRTL to contract out any portion of the testing and evaluation
conducted for applicants seeking MSHA approval. Additionally, the proposed rule would require the testing and evaluation
to be performed in-house at the facilities of the NRTL specifically accredited by OSHA to perform the MSHA tests and
evaluations required. In this way, MSHA could continue to ensure that the NRTL accredited by OSHA as having the capability,
including the necessary equipment and trained personnel, to perform the specific MSHA tests and evaluations is,
in fact, the laboratory conducting the testing and evaluation work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposal, the specific NRTL receiving recognition to perform MSHA testing and evaluation would be required
to perform all tests and evaluations in strict accordance with MSHA regulations, including the procedures and protocol
used by MSHA in conducting such testing and evaluation. The proposed rule would not permit an NRTL to change a testing
standard or any elements incorporated in the standard. Therefore, the provisions of ``II. Supplementary Procedures,
A. Test Standard Changes'' of Appendix A to 29 CFR 1910.7 would not be a part of the MSHA program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;6.10(c) would reserve the right of MSHA to observe or verify the testing and evaluation conducted
for products approved by MSHA. This is to ensure that the OSHA-recognized NRTLs continue to perform tests and evaluations
to MSHA requirements in an appropriate manner. This safeguard would supplement the existing NRTL quality control
program which includes the performance of internal audits as required by the OSHA recognition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;6.10(d) would require that the manufacturer of the MSHA-approved product affix a durable NRTL mark
as well as a durable MSHA mark to the product. The test standard used in testing and evaluating the product for MSHA approval
also would be required to be referenced on the NRTL's marking. This would allow the role of the NRTL participating in
the MSHA approval program to be clearly identified in the field, both to the user of the approved product and to MSHA
inspection personnel. In addition, this inclusion would protect the product user from unknowingly using a product
bearing the MSHA and NRTL's marks in an environment for which the product has not been tested, evaluated, and approved.
In this way, product defects discovered in the field by users or reported to and confirmed by MSHA could be addressed
without delay. MSHA would promptly notify the manufacturer and associated NRTL of product defects identified or
confirmed by MSHA, so that coordinated corrective action could be initiated to protect the safety of the miners and
ensure the integrity of the MSHA and NRTL's marks.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under proposed &sect;6.10(e), internal audits performed by an NRTL as part of the quality control program required
by the OSHA accreditation would have to be made available for review by MSHA. This provision would not require NRTLs
to submit copies of all internal audits to MSHA. Instead, it simply would require an NRTL to make such audits available
to MSHA for review when requested by the Agency. These internal audits provide documented verification that the OSHA-recognized
NRTL continues to satisfy the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.7(b)(4), is performing within its ``letter of recognition''
and its quality control program, and has not misrepresented the scope or conditions of its accreditation. Internal
audits under the OSHA NRTL program are done at appropriate intervals by trained and qualified persons. Guidelines
for the establishment of quality control programs for laboratories are available in ISO guides 25, 28, and 38. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed &sect;6.10(f), NRTLs recognized by OSHA to perform MSHA testing and evaluation would be required
to formulate and implement a ``follow-up'' program in accordance with the OSHA requirements of 29 CFR 1910.7(b)(2).
In addition, the proposal would mandate that NRTLs make available to MSHA for review any information gathered by an
NRTL during manufacturing site inspections or field audits of manufactured products approved by the MSHA. As indicated
in the discussion of paragraph (d) on internal audits, NRTLs would not be required to submit copies to MSHA of ``follow-up''
reports of manufacturing site inspections and products audits. They would need only to provide MSHA with copies upon
MSHA's request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, NRTLs would be required to notify MSHA immediately of product defects discovered so that appropriate corrective
action could be initiated to protect the safety and health of the miners. Because product defects can create hazards
underground, immediate notification should be by expeditious means, such as by telephone or fax. Telephone or other
contact should then be confirmed in writing. The oral and written notification should include a description of the
nature and extent of the problem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The prompt sharing of NRTL product audit information would enhance the MSHA post-approval product audit program,
permit rapid response to safety problems caused by product defects, and ensure the integrity of the MSHA and NRTL marks.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;6.10(g) would provide that approved products tested and evaluated by NRTLs recognized by OSHA to
perform MSHA testing and evaluation would be subject to periodic audit by MSHA to determine conformity with the technical
requirements upon which the approval was based. This aspect of the proposal would complement the ``follow-up'' program
required by the OSHA recognition and provide a mechanism for independent evaluation by MSHA of approved products.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (g) would require an approval holder, upon MSHA's request, to make an approved product available
to MSHA for audit, at no cost to MSHA. MSHA would make such a request no more than once a year, except for cause. This would
be in addition to MSHA's ongoing quality assurance program through which the Agency can obtain products for audit
at any time at MSHA's expense, and the field audit program conducted by the specific NRTL upon whose testing and evaluation
MSHA bases its approval action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approved products to be audited by MSHA would be selected by the Agency as representative of those distributed for
use in underground mines. When an approved product is requested by MSHA for audit from the approval holder, the Agency
would arrange to examine and evaluate it at a mutually-agreed-upon time and location and would permit the approval
holder to observe any audit-related tests conducted. This examination and evaluation could take place at an MSHA
facility, at the manufacturer's plant or distribution center, or at any other place agreed upon by MSHA and the approval
holder. The approval holder would be able to obtain any final report resulting from such audits.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would allow MSHA to more effectively determine whether products are, in fact, being manufactured
as approved. MSHA, not the manufacturer, would select the product and MSHA also would continue to obtain approved
products from sources other than the manufacturer. This approach is particularly useful for products that are ``one
of a kind'' or of limited distribution. Because these products are not readily found at mine suppliers or distributors,
they would be difficult to locate without the assistance of the approval holder. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining which approved products would be subject to audit at any particular time, MSHA would consider a variety
of factors such as whether the manufacturer has previously produced the approved product or similar products, whether
the approved product is new or part of a new product line, or whether the approved product is intended for a unique application
or limited distribution. Other considerations may include product complexity, the manufacturer's previous product
audit results, product population in the mining community, and the time since the last audit or since the product was
first approved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on MSHA's experience, the Agency anticipates few instances in which it would request at no cost more than one
approved product from any one manufacturer in any one year. There are circumstances or causes, however, under which
additional products for audit may be necessary to ascertain compliance with the technical requirements upon which
an approval was based. Examples of such circumstances include verified complaints about the safety of an approval
product, evidence of product changes that have not been approved, audit test results that warrant further testing
to determine compliance, and evaluation of corrective action taken by an approval holder. Under these circumstances,
the approval holder would have to provide, at no cost to MSHA, additional approved products so the Agency could ensure
that the approval holder is meeting the obligation to manufacture the product as approved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When discrepancies are found during MSHA audits of approved products, MSHA would require that the manufacturer take
all necessary corrective actions. These actions could include, but are not limited to, the approval holder's recalling
or retrofitting the approved product involved and issuing user notices. Revocation of the approval by MSHA could
result when discrepancies in approved products are not successfully corrected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;6.10(h) would require all proposed changes to approved products to be submitted to MSHA for an extension
of approval prior to implementation of the change to ensure that product changes do not result in hazardous conditions
or violations of MSHA requirements when approved products are used underground. It is important that MSHA be aware
of and approve any changes to the approved product that may impact on the approval requirements. Such changes would
be tested and evaluated, as necessary, to determine compliance with MSHA approval requirements. In keeping with
the philosophy and intent of this proposed regulation, testing and evaluation of changes to approved products would
be carried out by an NRTL specifically recognized by OSHA to perform the necessary tests and evaluations for MSHA product
approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;6.10(i) would establish the bases and procedures for revocation of NRTL recognition. The Assistant
Secretary for OSHA has the authority to revoke for cause the recognition of any NRTL accredited under OSHA's NRTL program,
and this would include the authority to revoke the recognition of an NRTL accredited to perform testing and evaluation
to MSHA approval requirements. Under the proposal, action to revoke recognition of an NRTL to perform MSHA testing
and evaluation would be taken if the NRTL: (1) Has failed to continue to substantially satisfy the requirements of
29 CFR 1910.7 or Appendix A to 1910.7; (2) has failed to reasonably perform the NRTL testing requirements encompassed
within its letter of recognition; (3) has materially misrepresented itself in its applications or misrepresented
the scope or conditions of its recognition; or (4) has failed to comply with the requirements set forth in this proposed
rule for recognition as an NRTL to perform testing and evaluation to MSHA approval requirements.

In initiating action to revoke the recognition of an NRTL to perform testing and evaluation to MSHA requirements,
the proposed rule would require that the procedures for revocation established in Appendix A to 1910.7 be followed.
Under those procedures, OSHA is required to provide the recognized NRTL notice in writing of the alleged deficiencies,
giving the NRTL the opportunity to rebut or correct the alleged deficiencies within a reasonable period. If the deficiencies
are not corrected or reconciled within the time period provided, OSHA would propose, in writing, to revoke the recognition.
The revocation would be effective in 60 days unless within that period the recognized NRTL corrects the deficiencies
or requests a hearing in writing. If a hearing is requested, it would be held before an administrative law judge (ALJ)
of the Department of Labor according to the rules specified in 29 CFR part 1905, subpart C. In the hearing, the burden
of proof would be on OSHA to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the recognition should be revoked based
on the causes alleged in the proposed notice of revocation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under paragraph E.3., Final Decision, of Appendix A, the ALJ would issue a decision based on the entirety of the record
as to whether the recognition should be revoked. Exceptions to the ALJ decision would be accepted for 20 days. If no
exceptions were filed, this would become the final decision of the Assistant Secretary of OSHA. If exceptions are
filed, the ALJ decision, the exceptions filed, and the entire file would be forwarded to the Assistant Secretary for
OSHA for final decision. A copy of the Assistant Secretary's final decision on the revocation would be provided to
the NRTL and a notification would be published in the

Section 6.20 Use of Equivalent Testing and Evaluation Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;6.20 (a) and (b) would permit MSHA, and appropriately recognized NRTLs, when requested by the applicant
for product approval, to use international, consensus, or other recognized approval requirements that differ from
those set forth in existing MSHA regulations to test and evaluate certain mining equipment after MSHA has determined
that such requirements are ``equivalent'' or can be enhanced to provide equivalency. Part 7 would not be affected
by this proposed provision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes that this proposal would encourage a more rapid introduction of mining products embodying new
technology with enhanced safety features. In addition, testing and evaluation to ``equivalent'' requirements,
that provide the same or a greater degree of protection to miners as those set forth in the various MSHA product approval
regulations, would stimulate metric conversion, lead to greater compatibility with international standards,
and provide a more competitive posture for U.S. products in the international market. Implementation of this provision
would enable manufacturers of U.S. mining equipment or products to obtain MSHA's certification that their equipment
meets both the MSHA regulatory requirements and the equivalent international, consensus, or other recognized requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MSHA would decide which alternative requirements for product approval it would evaluate for ``equivalency.'' This
decision would be based on factors such as the potential to provide enhanced safety, the extent of usage of the alternative
requirements, the needs of the U.S. mining industry, the complexity of the candidate requirements, the difficulty
in ensuring equivalency, and the Agency resources available to address the determination. The evaluation would
be conducted by the Agency's Approval and Certification Center using personnel with expertise in the approval requirements
involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this proposal, once MSHA has determined that equivalent requirements exist or that certain requirements,
other than those in MSHA approval regulations, can be enhanced to provide equivalency, the applicant would be given
the option of requesting that MSHA accept testing and evaluation of the applicant's product using the ``equivalent''
requirements rather than those found in the applicable product approval regulations. This option would permit the
manufacturer to design a machine or product to a single set of requirements acceptable to both MSHA and other market
areas, rather than designing separate machines to comply with the separate requirements of each market place in which
business is sought. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because this proposal would permit approval of mining equipment intended to compete in multiple market areas with
differing approval requirements, the approved product design would incorporate the highest level of safety required
by any of the intended market areas. For example, if the target markets include the United States and another nation
that has more stringent approval requirements for a specific product, MSHA would have the authority, at the request
of the applicant, to issue an approval based on testing and evaluation to the more stringent requirements. The approval
documentation would state that the product had fulfilled the more stringent requirements in addition to those of
MSHA. In this case, the approved product sold in the U.S. would have a higher degree of safety than that specified by
MSHA under existing requirements. Should the targeted foreign market area have product approval requirements which
are, in some aspects, less stringent than those of MSHA, the applicant would be required to fulfill the foreign target
area's requirements and, in addition, any other tests, evaluations, or enhancements necessary to ensure that the
product is at least as safe as that demanded by the MSHA approval requirements. In this situation, the approved product
would exceed the safety requirements of the foreign target area and be no less safe than required by MSHA.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As previously indicated, MSHA approval documentation would show that the product had fulfilled the requirements
of the foreign target market area and those of MSHA. In the first instance, the product marketed in the United States
would embody a higher level of safety, while in the second instance it would embody equivalent safety. In no case would
the product be less safe than mandated by MSHA approval requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following example illustrates how this concept would work. In testing and evaluating electrical circuits for
intrinsic safety under 30 CFR 18.68, MSHA uses spark test apparatus meeting the requirements of the International
Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), IEC 79&hyph;3 (1990). With this apparatus, each rotation of a four-wire electrode
holder produces at least six make-break sparks on a slotted cadmium disk in the presence of the explosive test gas mixture.
The MSHA procedure requires that the test duration be 1000 rotations of the four-wire electrode holder and that the
polarity of the test circuit be reversed after 500 rotations. This same apparatus is used to test intrinsically safe
circuits in partial fulfillment of the requirements of the IEC test, IEC 79&hyph;11 (1991), for intrinsic safety.
However, the IEC procedure specifies a test duration of 400 rotations of the four-wire electrode holder for DC circuits
and 1000 rotations for AC circuits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With all other factors equal, MSHA could consider the spark test specified by IEC 79&hyph;11 (1991) to be equivalent
to the spark-test procedure followed by MSHA in fulfillment of 30 CFR 18.68, by increasing the number of rotations
of the four-wire electrode holder used in the IEC DC circuit test by 100 rotations and adding 500 rotations with reversed
circuit polarity. For AC circuits, in addition to the 1000 rotations of the four-wire electrode holder required by
IEC, 500 rotations with reversed polarity tests would be required to meet the MSHA requirements. The resulting test
would exceed some aspects of both the MSHA and IEC procedures and would fulfill the requirements of both. In this manner
a single test could verify conformity to the test requirements of both parties with no reduction of safety in either
case. In like fashion, other MSHA and IEC requirements for the approval of intrinsically safe electrical circuits
could be reconciled to obtain equivalency without adverse impact on safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MSHA anticipates that savings from use of this option would reduce the manufacturer's unit cost by permitting more
standardized construction and, thus, improve the manufacturer's competitive position. This, together with the
need to provide products meeting the highest level of safety demanded by the market areas of interest, would encourage
a more rapid introduction of mining products embodying new technology with enhanced safety features. Because of
the potential for a more global market area, MSHA also expects an improved availability of specialized mining equipment
adapted to more safely address unique mining conditions for which equipment could not be developed without significant
market demand. In general, this proposal should provide increased opportunity for direct competition leading to
improved safety and performance quality in mining products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As is the case with existing MSHA approval regulations, this proposed rule would be nondiscriminatory as between
U.S. and foreign manufacturers. Any manufacturer, either domestic or foreign, wishing to acquire an MSHA product
approval would be able to take advantage of this ``equivalency'' program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the proposal would be consistent with the North American Free Trade Agreement and the newly negotiated Agreement
on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) which will become effective when the Uruguay Round Agreements enter into force
for the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;6.20(c) would require that, after a determination of ``equivalency'' is made, the industry be notified
of the determination through publication of a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The notice would clearly identify the alternative requirements evaluated and either indicate that they are ``equivalent''
or specify how they would need to be enhanced to provide equivalency to the corresponding MSHA product approval requirements.
Following publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the alternative requirements determined by MSHA to be equivalent, MSHA, as well as NRTLs recognized by OSHA to perform
the equivalent testing and evaluation requirements, would be able to conduct the equivalent testing and evaluation
when so requested by an applicant seeking product approval. The MSHA 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice of equivalent requirements also would specify whether an NRTL recognized by OSHA to perform testing and evaluation
to the original MSHA approval requirements would have to obtain an expansion of its OSHA recognition to perform testing
and evaluation to the ``equivalent'' alternative requirements.

Conforming Amendments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The changes to MSHA's procedures and requirements for testing and evaluation of products MSHA approves for use in
gassy, underground mines set forth in this new proposed part 6 also would necessitate certain conforming amendments
to the Agency's approval regulations in 30 CFR parts 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 26, 27, 29, 33, and 35. These approval regulations
contain application provisions for approval and extension of approval of products which manufacturers seeking
MSHA approval must follow. Therefore, appropriate revisions to these application provisions to reference proposed
part 6 are being included as part of this proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

IV. Fees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency's effort in the initial issuance of the approval would be reduced significantly because MSHA's role would
change from that of testing and evaluating prototype products to that of oversight, auditing, and addressing new
technology. Thus, MSHA fees charged to manufacturers would be reduced significantly. Because the Agency no longer
would provide certain kinds of testing and evaluation, its hourly and flat rate charges for such services would be
eliminated. However, in order to issue a manufacturer an MSHA approval, the Agency still would have to review the manufacturer's
documents. As a result of the proposed rule, the manufacturer's documents would now include the NRTL's testing and
evaluation results. MSHA estimates that due to the increased technical and administrative time needed to review
the NRTL testing and evaluation data, its application fee would increase from $100 to $400. The $400 estimate is based
upon a per-hour fee of $50 and an 8-hour average for technical and administrative review, which account for the fact
that applications vary in complexity and, therefore, differ in their review time.

V. Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12866 requires that regulatory agencies assess both the costs and benefits of proposed regulations.
MSHA has determined that this proposed rule does not meet the criteria of a significant regulatory action and, therefore,
has not prepared a separate analysis of costs and benefits. The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires regulatory agencies
to consider a rule's impact on small entities. This proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a
substantial number of small entities. The analysis contained in this preamble meets MSHA's responsibilities under
Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Benefits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this proposed rule, Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratories (NRTLs), rather than MSHA, would test and
evaluate most mining products requiring Federal approval. Having more than one entity available to conduct tests
and evaluations would facilitate a more efficient process of providing the required services and, thus, expedite
the introduction of new and innovative equipment into the Nation's mines. Moreover, the proposed rule would maintain
the existing level of workplace safety provided by Federal testing and evaluation because the NRTLs must be recognized
by the Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration as being qualified to perform specific
testing and evaluation for MSHA product approval. More importantly, MSHA still would be fully responsible for approving
any equipment tested and evaluated before it could be used in a mine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reducing the number of tests and evaluations it conducts would allow MSHA to direct its resources more to auditing
products actually used in mines. In addition, NRTLs recognized by OSHA must conduct field audits as part of their follow-up
programs, and under MSHA's proposed rule any reports of such audits would have to be made available to MSHA. These field
audits would ensure that products in use continue to meet the specifications of the approval. MSHA believes that increasing
such field audits would enhance safety. Also, shifting resources from routine testing and evaluation would permit
MSHA to direct more attention to evaluating new technology which may be safer than existing technology, potentially
accelerating the entry of such equipment into mines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the proposed rule would permit MSHA to accept product testing and evaluation based upon approval requirements
other than its own, so long as the alternative requirements provide at least the same level of safety as MSHA's requirements.
In some instances these requirements may be more stringent than MSHA's. Because products approved using the more
stringent requirements would have to be built to those requirements, safety would be enhanced. In addition, acceptance
of equivalent or enhanced requirements should allow a wider spectrum of safe and improved equipment to be used in mining.
This also would eliminate the need for manufacturers to design separate products to meet the demands of different
approval requirements, MSHA's approval requirements and, for example, an international requirement, where a single
design could provide the necessary level of safety. MSHA expects that this proposed rule also would facilitate the
use of metrification in the construction of equipment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
MSHA estimates that the costs of testing, evaluation, and approval for any particular product would increase under
the proposal. However, these costs would be offset by savings. Charges for testing and evaluating by NRTLs are often
greater than the fees charged by the Federal Government. NRTLs' operating costs tend to be higher than the Government's
and include a profit component that is not present in the Government's fees. NRTLs also charge manufacturers for providing
follow-up services with respect to products they have already tested and evaluated. MSHA expects the costs of testing
and evaluating any particular product to approximately double under the proposal. Further, although the NRTL, rather
than MSHA, would test and evaluate certain products, time would still be required for MSHA to review approval applications
that, under this proposal, would include the testing and evaluation data and results prepared by the NRTL and submitted
with the application package. Therefore, MSHA estimates that its application fee would increase from $100 to $400.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule, however, has the potential to provide substantial cost savings to manufacturers as the program
grows to maturity, which MSHA expects would outweigh any cost increases. In particular, manufacturers would realize
savings from the ability to design and manufacture a single product to serve multiple markets. Currently, MSHA may
not approve products meeting requirements that are different from the Agency's own. Therefore, some companies must
alter their products, which currently meet MSHA requirements, to meet the approval requirements of a foreign market
area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed rule, MSHA could approve a product based upon approval requirements other than its own, provided
that the alternative approval requirements have been determined by MSHA to be equivalent, or can be enhanced to provide
equivalency, by affording the same or a greater level of safety as MSHA's. Thus, by not having to design equipment to
meet two different approval requirements, manufacturers could have a more standardized product line, reduce unit
costs, and improve quality control. Most manufacturers, whether large or small, also should experience cost savings
by being able to market their products sooner because more entities would be providing the services that MSHA alone
currently supplies. The ability to decrease the amount of time for developing and introducing a product into the market
can cut overall costs for manufacturers. Due to the absence of information concerning individual manufacturers'
product lines, management objectives, and marketing strategies, MSHA was not able to quantify these cost savings.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, Executive Order 12866 also requires that regulatory agencies assess the impact on the Government for any
regulation determined to be a significant regulatory action. MSHA does not believe that the proposed rule would create
any significant cost impacts on the Government. Rather, this proposed regulation would allow MSHA to improve its
existing post-approval audit program by reallocating its resources from testing and evaluation to audit responsibilities.
The proposed rule can be implemented under existing Government practices without any substantial equipment or facility
expenditures by the Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MSHA solicits comments on the costs and benefits of this proposed rule to all manufacturers who produce products requiring
MSHA approval.
