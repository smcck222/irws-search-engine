SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is amending its regulations for the medical use of byproduct material. This
action is being taken in response to a petition for rulemaking. This final rule is intended to provide greater flexibility
by allowing properly qualified nuclear pharmacists and authorized users who are physicians greater discretion
to prepare radioactive drugs containing byproduct material for medical use. This final rule, while allowing research
involving human subjects using byproduct material, requires NRC licensees who conduct such research to obtain the
informed consent of the human subjects and the prior review and approval of an ``institutional review board'' within
the meaning of the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects. This final rule also allows medical use of radiolabeled
biologics. In addition, this final rule contains other miscellaneous and conforming amendments necessary to clarify
or update the current regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
The Petition for Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In early 1989, the American College of Nuclear Physicians (ACNP) and the Society of Nuclear Medicine (SNM) approached
the NRC staff with concerns that the Commission's regulations failed to accommodate the functions and responsibilities
of the practice of nuclear pharmacy. At the suggestion of the NRC staff, the ACNP and SNM submitted a petition for rulemaking
requesting the Commission to amend its regulations to fully recognize the role of licensed nuclear pharmacists and
physicians. On September 15, 1989 (54 FR 38239), the Commission published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a notice of receipt of a petition for rulemaking for public comment (PRM&hyph;35&hyph;9). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the development of the ACNP-SNM petition, one NRC staff member provided substantial assistance in the preparation
of the petition. However, that individual has not participated in the NRC's resolution of the petition or in the development
of this rule. Another NRC staff member reviewed the petition prior to its formal submittal to the Commission and participated,
to some extent, in the NRC's resolution of the petition and in the development of the rule. The Commission, while aware
of this background, considered the petition on its own merits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petition included the following requests: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. The petitioners requested that authorized users who are physicians (physician authorized users) be given greater
flexibility regarding the medical use of radiopharmaceuticals containing byproduct material. Specifically,
the petitioners requested that these physicians be permitted to: (1) Use radiopharmaceuticals to treat diseases
that are not listed in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved package insert; (2) Use methods of administration
of radiopharmaceuticals that are not listed in the package insert; (3) Use radiopharmaceuticals other than those
for which the FDA has accepted an Investigational New Drug (IND) or an approved New Drug Application (NDA); (4) Prepare
radiopharmaceuticals using radionuclide generators and reagent kits in a manner other than in accordance with the
manufacturer's instructions; and (5) Compound radiopharmaceuticals in accordance with State law.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
B. The petitioners requested that the NRC recognize the practice of nuclear pharmacy and the certification of nuclear
pharmacists by the Board of Pharmaceutical Specialties. Specifically, the petitioners requested that nuclear
pharmacists be permitted to: (1) Compound radiopharmaceuticals as allowed by State or FDA regulations; (2) Compound
radiopharmaceuticals whose manufacture and distribution are not regulated by the State or FDA; (3) Prepare radiopharmaceuticals
using radionuclide generators and reagent kits in a manner other than in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions;
(4) Produce reagent kits; and (5) Dispense radiopharmaceuticals that are not regulated by the FDA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. Additionally, the petitioners requested that the NRC: (1) Permit categories of research using radioactive drugs
that do not require an IND, such as research approved by a Radioactive Drug Research Committee (RDRC); (2) Permit the
use of radiolabeled biologics for which the FDA has issued a license in response to a product license application (PLA);
and (3) Clarify its regulations pertaining to specific licenses of broad scope.

In response to the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice that announced the receipt of the petition, 466 comment letters were received. About 99 percent of the commenters
supported and agreed with the petition. After consideration of the public comment letters and consultation with
the FDA staff, the Commission determined that some issues should be addressed promptly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 23, 1990 (55 FR 34513), the Commission published an Interim Final Rule to allow, for a period of 3 years, the
use of therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals for indications not listed in the package insert and to allow departures
from the manufacturer's instructions for preparing diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals using radionuclide generators
and reagent kits. On July 22, 1993, the Commission extended the expiration date of the Interim Final Rule from August
23, 1993, to December 31, 1994. The action allows licensees to continue to use byproduct material under the provisions
of the Interim Final Rule until the Commission completes this final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a parallel effort, the NRC continued to work on the remaining issues in the ACNP&hyph;SNM petition. On August 7,
1991, the NRC conducted a public workshop in Rosemont, Illinois, to present ``strawman'' language on the training
and experience criteria for authorized nuclear pharmacists to representatives of the following organizations:
Board of Pharmaceutical Specialties, American Board of Science in Nuclear Medicine, National Association of Boards
of Pharmacy, Committee on Radionuclides and Radiopharmaceuticals of the U.S. Council for Energy Awareness, American
Pharmaceutical Association, American Society of Hospital Pharmacists, and three graduate schools of pharmacy.
Subsequently, the NRC also discussed the proposed resolution of these issues in meetings with the FDA, the NRC's Advisory
Committee on the Medical Uses of Isotopes (ACMUI), and the Agreement States. This rulemaking is the evolutionary
result of numerous meetings with the aforementioned groups.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In a policy statement published on February 9, 1979 (44 FR 8242), entitled ``Regulation of the Medical Uses of Radioisotopes;
Statement of General Policy,'' the NRC stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The NRC will continue to regulate the medical uses of radioisotopes as necessary to provide for the radiation safety
of workers and the general public.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. The NRC will regulate the radiation safety of patients where justified by the risk to patients and where voluntary
standards, or compliance with these standards, are inadequate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The NRC will minimize intrusion into medical judgments affecting patients and into other areas traditionally
considered to be a part of the practice of medicine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In conformance with this policy, the Commission is eliminating certain restrictions in the NRC regulations on the
practices of medicine and pharmacy (e.g., compounding), and is providing the authority for research involving human
subjects and the use of radiolabeled biologics. The Commission believes that these restrictions can be eliminated
without compromising the level of protection of public health and safety against radiological hazards. The Commission
recognizes that physicians have the primary responsibility for the diagnosis and treatment of their patients or
human research subjects and recognizes that nuclear pharmacists have the primary responsibility for the preparation
of radioactive drugs. NRC regulations are predicated on the assumption that properly trained and adequately informed
physicians and pharmacists will make decisions that are in the best interest of their patients or human research subjects.
Furthermore, the pharmacological aspects of radioactive drugs, including drug safety and efficacy, are regulated
by the FDA or the States.

II. The Proposed Rule, Public Comments, and NRC Responses
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission published the proposed rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on June 17, 1993 (58 FR 33396), and provided a 120-day public comment period. About 2,500 copies of the notice of the
proposed rulemaking were mailed to all applicable NRC licensees, Agreement State and Non-Agreement State agencies,
and other interested groups. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC received 284 comment letters in response to the proposed rule. There were 280 letters in support of the proposed
rule, 1 letter in opposition to the proposed rule, and 3 letters provided comments without specifically indicating
support for or opposition to the proposed rule. There were 182 letters from individuals working in commercial pharmacies,
3 from pharmaceutical manufacturers, 6 from hospitals, 7 from professional associations, 6 from universities,
5 from governmental agencies, and 75 who did not indicate their affiliations. In terms of commenters' professions
or qualifications, the vast majority of letters were from pharmacists. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public comments and the NRC's responses are presented below. General comments are presented first, followed by specific
comments associated with individual sections of the rule for which comments were received. The discussion of the
changes in the proposed rule language is presented in section III entitled ``Discussion of Final Rule Text.'' Referring
to section V, entitled ``Text of Final Regulations,'' may expedite the reader's understanding of the public comments
and the NRC's responses.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NRC is ``straying very far'' from its mandate and competence in regulating the medical uses of byproduct material.
The commenter appended a copy of section 104 of the Atomic Energy Act, entitled ``Medical Therapy and Research and
Development,'' as rationale for the commenter's viewpoint.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission's statutory mandate in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, includes all uses of byproduct, source,
and special nuclear material. Specifically, section 81 of the Act 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
prohibits,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 without Commission authorization, the manufacture, production, transfer, receipt in interstate commerce, acquisition,
ownership, possession, import, or export of byproduct material (42 U.S.C. 2111). Also, section 161 of the Act states
(in part): 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is authorized to establish by rule, regulation, or order, such standards and instructions to govern
the possession and use of special nuclear material, source material, and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
byproduct material
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 as the Commission may deem necessary or desirable to promote the common defense and security or to protect health or
to minimize danger to life or property (emphasis added). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Therefore, the Commission has broad statutory responsibility to regulate all uses of byproduct material, including
medical use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 104(a) of the Atomic Energy Act states: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is authorized to issue licenses to persons applying therefor 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
for utilization facilities for use in medical therapy.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 In issuing such licenses the Commission is directed to permit the widest amount of effective medical therapy possible
with the amount of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
special nuclear material 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
available for such purpose and to impose the minimum amount of regulation consistent with its obligations under this
Act to promote the common defense and security and to protect the health and safety of the public (42 U.S.C. 2134(a))
(emphasis added). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 104(a) on its face applies only to medical therapy licensees for using ``utilization facilities'' (i.e.,
nuclear reactors) and ``special nuclear material.'' No ``minimum regulation'' directive governs the Commission's
regulation of byproduct material. This section does not even apply to the medical use of byproduct material, which
falls within the NRC's broad standard-setting authority in sections 81 and 161 of the Act. Even if the commenter were
correct that the NRC had a statutory obligation to minimize regulation, this rule eliminates certain restrictions
in the regulation of the medical use of byproduct material, furthering that purpose. The Commission is, in fact, imposing
the minimum amount of regulation commensurate with the need for protection of the public health and safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the NRC's competence, ``[t]he substantive area in which an agency is deemed to be expert is determined by
statute.''

 112 S.Ct. 275 (1991). The Atomic Energy Act commits to the NRC the duty of regulating the use of byproduct materials,
including radioactive drugs, to protect public health and safety and as a matter of law the NRC is deemed ``expert''
in making technical and policy judgements in this field. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC has long experience in regulating nuclear medicine and ``[i]n recent years has increased its recruitment
of personnel who have experience and knowledge either in nuclear medicine or in radiation therapy'' (56 FR 34104;
July 25, 1991). Since the Commission's inception, it has been accountable for the regulation of medical uses of byproduct
material. It has licensed, inspected, collected and analyzed data in this field for many years, and has issued and
administered various forms of regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, this rulemaking is not about what dosage of a radioactive drug should be prescribed to treat or diagnose
a patient. It is about the qualifications of individuals performing NRC-licensed activities (e.g., authorized
nuclear pharmacists) that are necessary to protect the health and safety of patients and workers from radiological
hazards. This rule, in other words, does not intrude on medical judgment. Moreover, the NRC has highly qualified staff
and extensive experience in determining radiation safety qualifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the NRC has an advisory committee (the Advisory Committee on the Medical Uses of Isotopes or ``ACMUI''),
which, since its establishment many years ago, has advised the NRC on rulemakings and other initiatives related to
the medical uses of byproduct material. The membership of the ACMUI includes a broad spectrum of expertise, such as
physicians (i.e., in nuclear medicine, cardiology, and radiation oncology), medical physicists, pharmacists,
medical researchers, practicing technologists, hospital administrators, state medical regulators, Food and
Drug Administration representatives, and a patient rights representative. The NRC also has a visiting medical fellows
program that allows selected physicians or pharmacists to work for NRC for a period of 1 to 2 years. Both ACMUI and the
visiting medical fellows provided advice to the NRC during the development of this rule.

Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC is attempting to duplicate regulation by other federal, state, and national entities which already have appropriate
responsibility in the areas of medicine and pharmacy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule is not duplicating regulation by other federal or state agencies. In fact, this rule is designed to
avoid duplication of the regulations of other federal agencies (e.g., see response to comments on &sect;35.6). In
the area of medical use of byproduct material, the NRC and FDA signed a Memorandum of Understanding (58 FR 47300; September
8, 1993) to coordinate existing NRC and FDA regulatory programs. Generally speaking, FDA regulates the manufacture
and distribution of radioactive drugs and medical devices for safety and efficacy, while the NRC regulates radiation
safety associated with the actual use of these products.

Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The preamble to the proposed rule gives the impression that the NRC would allow nuclear physicians and nuclear pharmacists
to use unregulated, dangerous radioactive drugs. In addition, a commenter stated that, under State Pharmacy law,
a licensed pharmacist may delegate certain duties to non-pharmacist individuals if the pharmacist provides ``direct
supervision.'' Is it the NRC's intent to permit the authorized nuclear pharmacist to delegate the full range of professional
duties to non-pharmacist individuals?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The preamble to the proposed rule stated that a licensee must meet the Commission's regulations regarding radiation
safety of the workers and the public, including patients, and that the licensee is not relieved from complying with
applicable FDA, other Federal, and State requirements governing radioactive drugs. Because the FDA and States regulate
the safety and efficacy of radioactive drugs, the licensee must also follow their regulations when using radioactive
drugs. The Commission will allow an authorized nuclear pharmacist to delegate a full range of duties to a non-pharmacist
individual provided that the individual is properly supervised (i.e., according to &sect;35.25).

The Commission agrees that licensees may not need 6 months to implement this final rule. However, with limited exceptions,
section 553(d) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) provides that ``[t]he required publication or service
of a substantive rule shall be made not less than 30 days before its effective date.'' The commenter has not persuaded
the NRC that good cause exists for making immediately effective this final rule, which in part, imposes new substantive
requirements. Therefore, the effective date will be 30 days after publication of this rule in the

The NRC should provide a mechanism for ``grandfathering'' qualified nuclear pharmacists who are currently working
in hospital-based nuclear pharmacies, similar to the mechanism proposed for ``grandfathering'' qualified individuals
working in commercial nuclear pharmacies.

The Commission agrees with this comment because a qualified nuclear pharmacist should be ``grandfathered'' regardless
of whether the individual is currently working in a commercial nuclear pharmacy or a hospital-based nuclear pharmacy.
Therefore, &sect;35.981 entitled ``Training for experienced nuclear pharmacists,'' has been added to this final
rule. This section is similar to &sect;32.72 in the proposed rule for ``grandfathering'' qualified individuals
working in commercial nuclear pharmacies. The Commission believes that this limited ``grandfathering'' is justified
provided: (1) This individual is currently working in a nuclear pharmacy; (2) this individual has completed a structured
educational program as specified in &sect;35.980(b)(1); and (3) the qualifications of this individual would be
reviewed and approved by NRC before a licensee may allow this individual to work as an authorized nuclear pharmacist.

One commenter stated that ``the FDA has a specific definition which it uses for radiopharmaceuticals, and I am not
aware that it will similarly replace this word with that of radioactive drug.'' Also, the commenter questioned whether
the term ``radioactive drug'' included radiolabeled biologics.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA regulations define the term ``radioactive drug'' (21 CFR 310.3) but do not define the term ``radiopharmaceutical.''
As stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, the term ``radioactive drug'' includes a radiolabeled biologic, which
is an accurate usage for both NRC and FDA regulations.

The medical use of byproduct material may be approved by the FDA as a radioactive drug or a device. If it is approved as
a device, not a radioactive drug, would the proposed changes create regulatory barriers in such situations?

This rule does not impose any new regulatory requirements for the use of devices containing byproduct material. Therefore,
this rule would not create regulatory barriers for the use of such devices.

The Commission currently permits the nuclear pharmacy of a Part 33 or 35 medical use licensee to distribute radioactive
drugs to a limited set of medical use licensees through a license amendment approval on a case-by-case basis. This
is the context in which such licensees may ``share'' a nuclear pharmacy. The Commission believes that Part 33 or 35
licensees who have been granted this authority could continue to operate a nuclear pharmacy provided that the nuclear

Other Part 33 or 35 medical use licensees seeking this authority must first apply for a license amendment and receive
an authorization for limited distribution pursuant to Part 32. The fees specified in Category 3C of 10 CFR 170.31 and
10 CFR 171.16 are assessed for this type of authorization. As provided in footnote 1(d)(2) of 10 CFR 170.31, there is
an application fee (fee Category 3C) to add this type of authorization. Upon issuance of the license amendment adding
this authorization, the licensee will be subject to the licensing and inspection fees in fee Category 3C of 10 CFR 170.31
and the annual fees in fee Category 3C of 10 CFR 171.16. These fees are in addition to any other fee categories covered

However, in those cases where a small number of Part 35 licensees wish to transfer unsealed byproduct material among
themselves, the NRC will consider granting an exemption pursuant to 10 CFR 35.19. 10 CFR 170.31 (footnote 2) specifies
the fees for such exemption requests. For existing Part 35 licensees, requests for an exemption under 10 CFR 35.19

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters stated that the NRC has no legal jurisdiction over drug labeling and should not require drug labeling
because it is regulated by the FDA. Another commenter supported the proposed labeling requirements and stated that
its facility has already included all information specified in the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has broad authority under sections 81 and 161 of the Atomic Energy Act, as amended, including authority
to establish by rule, regulation, or order, such standards and instructions to govern the possession and use of byproduct
material. Therefore, the Commission has jurisdiction to require labeling of radioactive drugs containing byproduct
material and is currently requiring that specific information be included on labels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission's labeling requirements are not intended to duplicate FDA requirements, but are intended to provide
information related to radiation safety. These labels are needed for: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Hospital workers to ensure that the radioactive drug is the correct drug and the correct dosage; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The modifications to current &sect;32.72(a)(4) are intended to clarify the existing labeling requirements, except
for the addition of ``time of assay.'' Thus, the Commission believes that licensees will not incur significant additional
cost associated with these modifications. In terms of inspections, the NRC inspectors do not check the label of every
container or package of a radioactive drug. They may conduct spot checks. Thus, there will not be a significant cost
for NRC inspectors either.

. The syringe label should not be limited to the clinical procedure. On the other hand, it is unnecessary to require
that the label, or the leaflet or brochure that accompanies the radioactive drug, contain all of the statements specified
in the proposed rule.

. The regulatory text in this section states: ``In addition, the label for the syringe or syringe radiation shield
must also contain the clinical procedure to be performed or the patient's or the human research subject's name.''
Thus, the clinical procedure is an additional item but not the only item on the label. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the statements that must be included in the leaflet or brochure, the Commission believes these statements
are necessary because they serve as warnings to individuals who are not authorized to use the byproduct material.
However, the statement that ``other regulatory approvals may be required'' has been deleted because this concern
is already covered by 10 CFR 35.7.

. This comment quotes the last sentence of &sect;32.72(a)(4) of the proposed rule, stating that: ``NRC's labeling
requirements are independent of requirements of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).'' This comment appears
to question the NRC's statutory authority for the quoted statement. As previously stated in response to comment 1
on &sect;32.72(a)(4), the NRC's statutory authority to impose requirements with respect to the labeling of radioactive
drugs containing byproduct material derives from its authority under the Atomic Energy Act (primarily sections
81 and 161b) to regulate byproduct material. The quoted sentence makes it clear that NRC's labeling requirements
are separate from the labeling requirements of FDA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The NRC disagrees with this comment. Under sections 182 and 183 of the Atomic Energy Act, the Commission has broad
authority over the scope of license applications and the terms of licenses. Section 182(a) includes the authority
to require, by rule or regulation, such information as the Commission determines necessary to decide, among other
things, the technical 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and other
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 qualifications of the applicant as the Commission may deem appropriate, as well as the applicant's character. Therefore,
in determining whether to grant a license or license amendment, or approve an individual to perform licensed activities,
the NRC can consider the past performance and character (which may include activities involving improper or illegal
practices) of the license applicant, the licensee, or the individual who is to perform licensed activities. An individual
occupying the position of a physician authorized user or authorized nuclear pharmacist has the potential to affect
the public health and safety. Accordingly, it would be appropriate for the NRC to consider information relating to
that individual's ``character.''

 The regulation does not require medical use licensees to measure the activity of a unit dosage of an alpha- or a beta-emitting
radionuclide. This provision should also apply to commercial nuclear pharmacies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 35.52(a) will exempt a medical use licensee from measuring the alpha- or beta-activity of a unit dosage, if
the licensee obtains that unit dosage from a commercial nuclear pharmacy. This exemption is acceptable because &sect;32.72(c)
will require the commercial nuclear pharmacy to measure that activity before dispensing the radioactive drug. Commercial
nuclear pharmacies would be required to measure the alpha- or beta-activity of a unit dosage because, otherwise,
it might not be measured by anyone. Therefore, this provision cannot be applied to commercial nuclear pharmacies.

 It is an acceptable regulatory drafting convention that for a sentence with multiple independent conditions, only
one ``or'' is necessary between the last condition and the previous condition to indicate that satisfying any one
of the conditions is acceptable. Because this definition has three independent conditions, an ``or'' between the
first and the second condition is not necessary.

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 By including human research subjects under ``medical care,'' it is implied that a physician may be allowed to deliver
any radiation dose to a human research subject if the physician can convince the local IRB that the dose is warranted.
Also, the concept of implying that human research subjects can be considered as patients may cause difficulty because
there are separate laws and considerations for each group. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The definition under discussion is ``medical use,'' not ``medical care.'' The term ``medical use'' is specifically
defined for the purpose of identifying a class of uses involving byproduct material that is regulated by the Commission.
By using the term ``patients or human research subjects'' in connection with a requirement, the Commission states
that the requirement applies to both patients and human research subjects. The Commission does not intend to imply
that a human research subject can be considered as a patient, nor does the Commission intend to imply that a physician
may deliver any radiation dose to a human research subject, without appropriate approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission recognizes that there are separate medical or pharmacy laws and considerations governing human research
subjects and patients. However, the Commission has determined that the radiation safety requirements in its regulations
that are designed to protect patients from radiological hazards are equally applicable to human research subjects.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There could be some difficulty when applying the quality management program to human research subjects. Also, annual
review of human use studies is redundant of FDA regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The quality management program (QMP) applies only to research procedures using quantities of byproduct material
specified in &sect;35.32(a)(1). However, because most research procedures use quantities of byproduct material
that are less than those specified in &sect;35.32, the QMP would not be required for these research procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The review specified in &sect;35.32(b) applies only to human research procedures for which written directives are
required. The review includes evaluation of a representative sample of administrations, recordable events, and
misadministrations, to verify compliance with the QMP. These evaluations are specifically related to the requirements
in the Commissions's regulations, which are not redundant of FDA regulations.

Section 35.6&blank;Provisions for Research Involving Human Subjects

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the preamble of the proposed rule, the Commission solicited public comment on the number and type of research activities
which would not be funded by another Federal agency which has adopted the Federal Policy and which would require a license
amendment under the proposed rule. No comments on the number and type of such research activities were received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, the Commission solicited public comment on whether it should broaden or narrow its focus to require compliance
with all or none of the provisions of the Federal Policy or equivalent license conditions. The Commission stated that
in making these comments, consideration should be given to the fact that all radiation safety provisions of 10 CFR
part 35 would be made applicable to research involving human subjects. Several comments were received related to
this topic. These comments and the NRC's responses are summarized below.

Omit all regulation of human research with radioactive material because the FDA handles this very nicely. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission cannot omit all such regulation because it has the responsibility for ensuring adequate protection
of public health and safety related to the use of byproduct material, including uses involving human research subjects.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In view of the fact that this final rule would specifically permit, in certain circumstances, NRC licensees to use
radioactive drugs containing byproduct material for research involving human subjects, the Commission has the
responsibility to address the protection of the rights of those human subjects. At a minimum, this final rule requires
NRC licensees who conduct such research to obtain the informed consent of the human research subjects and the prior
review and approval of an IRB, within the meaning of the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects. These
requirements apply whether or not the research is conducted, funded, supported, or regulated by another federal
agency which has implemented this Federal Policy or is approved by the amendment of an NRC license. However, NRC licensees
whose human research is covered by the Federal Policy as adopted by another federal agency, may conduct such research
without prior NRC approval. In this way, the provisions of this rule are designed to avoid duplication of the regulations
of other federal agencies which have adopted the Federal Policy, including the FDA.

The NRC should take steps to ensure that all provisions of the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects are
met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The basic safety objectives and ethical principles of the Federal Policy will be met by requiring licensees to obtain
the informed consent of the human research subjects and prior approval by an IRB. However, some provisions of the Federal
Policy are not directly applicable to the Commission's oversight of its licensees, such as the ``Use of Federal Funds,''
``Evaluations of Proposals for Research to be Conducted or Supported by a Federal Department or Agency,'' and ``Early
Termination of Research Support.'' Therefore, NRC does not need to take steps to ensure that all provisions are met.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, the proposed rule did not explicitly state that the required informed consent and IRB approval must
be in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects. Therefore, a phrase
``in accordance with the meaning of these terms as defined and described in the Federal Policy for the Protection of
Human Subjects'' has been added to the text of the final rule to clarify this point. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There were comments concerning the addition of ``human research subjects'' in the definition of ``medical use''
and the broadening of the quality management program to include human research subjects. These comments and NRC's
responses are summarized in the discussion of the definition of ``medical use'' under &sect;35.2.

Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There were two comments concerning this section. One commenter agreed with the proposed change. The other commenter
stated that the proposed change was not warranted because the Radiation Safety Committees (RSC) are overburdened
by other duties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission believes that it is important for the RSC to review the training and experience of authorized users
and authorized nuclear pharmacists and to approve or disapprove any such individuals because this review and the
approval or disapproval by RSC is a key factor in the program to ensure radiation safety. Furthermore, existing regulations
already require the RSC to perform such review and approval or disapproval of authorized users, Radiation Safety
Officers, and teletherapy physicists. By adding authorized nuclear pharmacists to the review and approval or disapproval
process of the RSC, the Commission does not believe that a significant burden will be added to the RSC's responsibilities
because it is expected that a relatively small number of authorized nuclear pharmacists will be included in Part 35
licenses.

Several commenters stated that this section should not be so restrictive and that instructions to workers can only
be provided by the supervising individuals. These commenters suggested that the provision for instructing workers
may be delegated to other qualified individuals. Similarly, they suggested that periodic review of the work of the
supervised individuals may also be delegated to other qualified individuals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission agrees that the workers may be instructed by the licensee, the supervising individuals, or other qualified
individuals as long as the instructors are knowledgeable about the subject areas. The regulatory text has been revised
to indicate that although the licensee may delegate these tasks to other qualified individuals, the licensee retains
the responsibility for instructing workers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the requirement for periodically reviewing the work of supervised individuals remains with the supervising
authorized nuclear pharmacist or physician authorized user. The Commission believes that the supervising individual
is in a better position to review the work than another individual.

One commenter suggested that this section should be retained. The commenter stated that the paperwork associated

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission disagrees with the commenter. When allowing a temporary authorized user to work, the licensee does
not need to notify the NRC each time that the individual provides coverage during another authorized user's vacation
or sickness. Under the notification requirement (&sect;35.14), the licensee needs to notify the NRC no later than
30 days after the date the licensee permits the individual to work as a temporary authorized user. The next notification
is when that individual permanently discontinues as a temporary authorized user. A notification is not required
during each period of coverage between the beginning and the termination of the service of the temporary authorized
user. This notification procedure also applies to a temporary authorized nuclear pharmacist. Thus, this section
has been removed.

 The proposed phrase ``over the range of its use between the highest dosage that will be administered to a patient or

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Linearity tests for a dose calibrator should cover the range from the highest patient dosage to the lowest patient
dosage that will be administered by a licensee. The lowest dosage could be in millicurie quantities for many licensees.
Thus, it is not necessary to test linearity to 1.1 megabecquerels (30 microcuries).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The intent of changing the lower limit of the linearity tests from 10 microcuries to 30 microcuries is to conform with
the requirements of the Quality Management Program (&sect;35.32) and to relieve a minor burden for measuring activities
between 10 and 30 microcuries without reducing radiation safety. To go beyond this by changing this limit to the lowest
patient dosage would have ramifications on the constancy checks, accuracy tests, and recordkeeping requirements
(i.e., &sect;&sect;35.50(b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3); and 35.53(a), (b), and (c)(3)). Therefore, deleting this
specific lower limit is beyond the scope of this rulemaking.

In expressing the units in both English units and SI units, English units should be first, followed by SI units in parentheses.
Also, is there any scientific rationale for the precision implied by 1.1 mBq, instead of using 1 mBq?

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission published a policy statement entitled ``Conversion to the Metric System'' (57 FR 46202; October 7,
1992). This policy statement specifies that the first unit will be in the SI unit with the English unit shown in brackets.
In terms of significant digits, the implied uncertainty for 30 microcuries is somewhere between 29 and 31 microcuries
and for 1.1 mBq is somewhere between 1.0 and 1.2 mBq. If 1 mBq is used, the implied precision would be less. Therefore,
1.1 mBq has been retained in the final rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this example, an estimated unit dosage must first be ordered from the nuclear pharmacy. After the physician authorized
user determines the precise dosage needed for the individual, the licensee may use either volume or weight to draw
the precise dosage from the vial. The use of volume or weight for drawing a smaller dosage from a vial containing an estimated
dosage is acceptable because that vial contains only the estimated dosage for one individual. Thus, even if an error
is made, the maximum error would be limited to the estimated dosage.

When drawing a dosage from a vial containing multiple dosages, a licensee should be allowed to determine the dosage

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Relative measurement of the alpha- or beta-activity of a radioactive drug could be inaccurate for a variety of reasons,
including inconsistent placement of the vial in the instrument's chamber. Without specific details of the procedure
for this relative measurement, the accuracy of the measurement is unknown. Therefore, the proposed method of using
volume and a measurement relative to some standard cannot be generically accepted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, if a medical use licensee would like to propose a specific set of procedures for a relative measurement of
a particular isotope that would provide acceptable accuracy, the licensee may apply for a license amendment on a case-by-case

The Commission currently permits a Part 33 licensee to distribute, on a limited basis, radioactive drugs to be used
only for research experiments through license amendment approvals on a case-by-case basis. As discussed in the response
to comments on 10 CFR 32.72(a)(2), Part 33 licensees seeking this authority must first obtain a license amendment
and receive an authorization for limited distribution pursuant to Part 32. Therefore, it is not necessary to modify
&sect;35.100 because it will allow medical use licensees to receive radioactive drugs from a Part 33 licensee authorized
for limited distribution.

One commenter stated that the proposed amendment to this section would impose severe restrictions on basic human
research. The commenter further stated that researchers who desire approval to administer radioisotopes for one
or two basic studies in humans and who are not preparing to become nuclear medicine physicians, will not meet these
strict criteria.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the NRC's existing regulatory framework, administering byproduct material to a patient or a human research
subject must be done by a physician authorized user or by an individual under the supervision of a physician authorized
user. The use of the term ``patient or human research subject'' in this section is to clarify that, if a researcher intends
to conduct basic studies using human subjects involving byproduct material, it is necessary to have a physician authorized
user provide supervision so that the researcher may administer byproduct material to human research subjects. This
is an existing regulatory position and it has not been changed by this rulemaking.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter stated that the certification by the American Osteopathic Board of Radiology (AOBR) should be recognized
in all applicable sections in 10 CFR Part 35. Under the existing regulations, the Commission has recognized AOBR in
&sect;&sect;35.910, 35.920, 35.940, 35.950, and 35.960, but not in &sect;35.300.

Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Following receipt of this comment, the Commission requested additional information from AOBR concerning training
and certification criteria for therapeutic use of unsealed byproduct material. After reviewing supporting documents
provided by the AOBR, the Commission has determined that the certification of AOBR is equivalent to the certification
of American Board of Radiology (ABR). Therefore, recognition of certification by AOBR has been added in &sect;35.930
of this final rule for certification granted after 1984 because all candidates certified by AOBR since 1984 will meet
the NRC's training requirements.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There were several comments concerning whether the recentness of training should be 5 years as in the existing regulations,
or 7 years as in the proposed rule. Some commenters favored 5 years and stated that the clinical practice changes rapidly,
thus, 5 years is more appropriate. Other commenters supported 7 years and stated that 5 years would be burdensome and
would not ensure superior training.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The training required in Part 35 concerns radiation safety principles and practices for the protection of public
health and safety. These radiation safety principles and practices are not expected to change rapidly with time.
Therefore, the Commission is adopting 7 years because this will not reduce the level of radiation protection provided
to workers and the public but will reduce the regulatory burden imposed on licensees.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The requirement for a preceptor statement is unnecessary and is irrelevant to the mission of the NRC. Many fully qualified
nuclear pharmacists would be excluded from being an authorized nuclear pharmacist by this administrative requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The written certification from a preceptor is a necessary part of the training and experience criteria. Even though
an individual has completed the required 700 hours of the structured educational program, it is still uncertain as
to whether this individual is capable of independently operating a nuclear pharmacy. The preceptor's statement
is needed to ensure that this individual has achieved the competency to do so.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to a nuclear pharmacist who is currently qualified to be an authorized nuclear pharmacist, a new section
(&sect;35.981) has been added to address this issue.

There are other available avenues for a qualified individual to be recognized as an authorized nuclear pharmacist.
Other avenues include: (i) Meeting the training criteria and obtaining a preceptor statement from an authorized
nuclear pharmacist; or (ii) Meeting the ``grandfathering'' provisions as specified in &sect;35.981 of this final
rule.

The Commission agrees that qualification as an authorized nuclear pharmacist should be based on training and experience.
This final rule provides several ways, including BPS certification, to achieve authorized nuclear pharmacist status,
all of which include a minimum level of training and experience. The various ways to achieve this status are provided
in &sect;&sect;35.980 and 35.981.

The Commission agrees that it could be useful for a training program to be monitored by an independent oversight group.
In addition, the Commission encourages voluntary oversight by an independent group such as a professional association.
However, given the oversight roles of the preceptor and the Radiation Safety Committee, the Commission does not see
a need to incorporate such a requirement.

It appears that the NRC desires to make ``authorized nuclear pharmacist'' status available only to those pharmacists
who are engaged in active clinical practice settings. This status should be also available to qualified nuclear pharmacists
working in facilities other than clinical practice settings, such as in the research laboratories or academic settings.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An authorized nuclear pharmacist who meets the training requirements as specified in &sect;35.980 should be competent
to independently operate a nuclear pharmacy regardless of the setting. When there is a need for an authorized nuclear
pharmacist outside the clinical setting, qualified individuals in research laboratories or academic settings
may also be designated as authorized nuclear pharmacists.

The Commission believes that an individual should not practice pharmacy unless this individual is licensed as a pharmacist
by a State. Thus, an authorized nuclear pharmacist must be a licensed pharmacist as required by &sect;&sect;35.980
and 35.981. However, an experienced individual (e.g., a nuclear chemist) may continue to work in a nuclear pharmacy
under the supervision of an authorized nuclear pharmacist or a physician authorized user.

Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Florida State Board of Pharmacy issues nuclear pharmacists a separate license based on a review of the individual's
qualification by its Nuclear Pharmacy Committee. Additionally, it requires a mandatory 12-hours per annum of continuing
education in a specific range of topic areas pertinent to nuclear pharmacy practice. With this type of licensing review
process already in place, how would the NRC consider applying this towards its ``limited grandfathering'' process
for granting ``authorized nuclear pharmacist'' status to Florida nuclear pharmacists? Would the Commission consider
this established Florida process for pharmacists as carrying sufficient weight which might serve as a third alternative
to its proposed language in 10 CFR 35.980? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 35.980 specifies that a pharmacist could be qualified as an authorized nuclear pharmacist in two ways: (i)
Through BPS certification; or (ii) through a structured educational program and a preceptor's statement. Because
qualification as an authorized nuclear pharmacist depends primarily on training and experience, if Florida licensed
nuclear pharmacists currently meet either (i) or (ii), they could qualify as authorized nuclear pharmacists. If
they do not meet either (i) or (ii), they would need either more training or experience, or a preceptor's statement
to qualify. Therefore, there is no benefit to adding a third alternative to 10 CFR 35.980. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For ``grandfathering'' an experienced nuclear pharmacist, a new section (&sect;35.981) has been added to the final
rule. This section specifies that an experienced pharmacist will be given authorized nuclear pharmacist status
if the individual: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Is a licensed pharmacist, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Is currently working in a nuclear pharmacy, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Has completed a structured educational program as specified in &sect;35.980(b)(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Florida licensed nuclear pharmacist who is currently working in a nuclear pharmacy could satisfy the first two criteria.
However, the comment letter did not provide any information regarding whether this individual meets the third criterion.
Therefore, such a nuclear pharmacist could qualify as an authorized nuclear pharmacist if that individual has completed
a structured educational program that equals or exceeds the requirements of &sect;35.980(b)(1).

This section was not included in the proposed rule, but has been added to the final rule in response to numerous comments.

qualified individuals who are currently working in commercial nuclear pharmacies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule language has been modified to clarify the intent of this section. These modifications are discussed
below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The phrase ``a licensee described by paragraph (a)(2)(iii) or (iv) of this section'' has been moved from proposed
&sect;32.72(b)(1) to the introductory phrase of &sect;32.72(b) to clarify that this phrase applies throughout
paragraph (b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The final rule text of &sect;32.72(b)(1) is essentially the same as the proposed (b)(1) except that the reference
to the definition of ``authorized nuclear pharmacist'' in Part 35 has been moved to paragraph (b)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A new &sect;35.72(b)(2) has been added to the final rule to make clear that there are three different ways that an
individual may qualify as an authorized nuclear pharmacist. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A new &sect;35.72(b)(3) has been added to the final rule to make clear that the actions authorized in &sect;32.72(b)(1)
and (2) are permitted in spite of more restrictive language in existing license conditions and to avoid the need for
many license amendments in order to implement the Commission's intentions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The proposed &sect;32.72(b)(2), which provided criteria for ``grandfathering'' qualified Part 32 ``authorized
users,'' has been redesignated as &sect;32.72(b)(4). Also, the proposed rule specified that a pharmacist may be
``grandfathered'' if the individual is identified on a Commission license as an ``authorized user'' on or before
the ``effective date'' of the rule; this cutoff date has been changed to the publication date of the final rule. This
change is needed because the Commission believes that ``grandfathering'' is only appropriate for those qualified
nuclear pharmacists who are ``authorized users'' on or before the publication date of this final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The proposed &sect;32.72(b)(3), which requires licensees to provide certain documents, has been redesignated
as &sect;32.72(b)(5). The final rule text in this paragraph has been modified to include several editorial changes,
including: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Replacing the phrase ``the individual's board certification, the license, or the permit'' by the phrase ``each
individual's certification by the Board of Pharmaceutical Specialties, the Commission or Agreement State license,
or the permit issued by a licensee of broad scope''; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Replacing the phrase ``within 30 days of the date'' by the phrase ``no later than 30 days after the date''; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Adding ``pursuant to paragraphs (b)(2)(i) or (b)(2)(iii)'' to indicate that a notification is not required
by paragraph (b)(2)(ii) because a license amendment is required.

Misadministration.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 During the public comment period, the Commission became aware of the need to clarify paragraph (4)(iii) of this definition.
The existing rule language, ``When the calculated weekly administered dose is 30 percent greater than the weekly
prescribed dose,'' if interpreted literally, means that a misadministration has occurred only when the calculated
weekly administered dose is exactly 30 percent greater than the weekly prescribed dose. The Commission intended
for this definition to cover incidents in which there is a difference of 30 percent 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
or more
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 between the calculated weekly administered dose and the weekly prescribed dose. To ensure that there is no ambiguity
as to the meaning of this provision, it has been reworded and the key phrase in the rule language has been changed from
``30 percent greater than'' to ``30 percent or more.'' Because this better expresses the intent of the existing rule
and is a minor administrative correction, the Commission believes that it can be incorporated in this final rule without
having first been included in the proposed rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The existing regulatory text of paragraph (5) of this definition of ``recordable event'' contains the same word structure
as paragraph (4)(iii) of the definition of misadministration (discussed above). To ensure that there is no ambiguity
as to the meaning of this provision, it has been reworded and the key phrase in the rule language has been changed from
``15 percent greater than'' to ``15 percent or more.'' Because this better expresses the intent of the existing rule
and is a minor administrative correction, the Commission believes that it can be incorporated in this final rule without
having first been included in the proposed rule.

There is no change between the final rule language and the proposed rule language in this section. However, the purpose
of this discussion is to remind medical use licensees who are not medical institutions that, pursuant to paragraphs
(b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section, they must review the necessary credentials and approve or disapprove any individual
who is to work as an authorized user or authorized nuclear pharmacist. In a medical institution, this review and approval
must be performed by its Radiation Safety Committee (see &sect;35.22(b)(2)(ii)).

of workers be done by the supervising individuals as well as by other qualified individuals. However, the requirement
for periodically reviewing the work of supervised individuals remains with the supervising authorized nuclear
pharmacist or physician authorized user.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the public comment period, the Commission became aware of the need to recognize certifications by the American
Osteopathic Board of Nuclear Medicine (AOBNM) and the American Osteopathic Board of Radiology (AOBR). A letter dated
August 16, 1990, from Richard E. Cunningham (Director, Division of Industrial and Medical Nuclear Safety, NRC),
to Paul J. Chase (Chairman, AOBR and Vice President, AOBNM), stated that the NRC intended to include certifications
of (1) AOBR in &sect;35.900, and (2) AOBNM in &sect;&sect;35.900, 35.910, and 35.920 in the next amendment to 10 CFR
Part 35. Therefore, the certifications by AOBR and AOBNM have been added to this section of the final rule.

Two additional board certifications have been recognized in this section of the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A comment stated that certification by the American Osteopathic Board of Radiology (AOBR) should be recognized in
all applicable sections of 10 CFR Part 35. Under the existing regulations, the Commission has recognized AOBR certification
in &sect;&sect;35.910, 35,920, 35.940, 35.950, and 35.960. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following receipt of this comment, the Commission requested additional information from AOBR concerning training
and certification criteria for therapeutic use of unsealed byproduct material. After reviewing supporting documents
provided by the American Osteopathic College of Radiology (AOCR), the Commission has determined that AOBR certification
is equivalent to certification by the American Board of Radiology (ABR). Therefore, recognition of certification
by AOBR has been added in &sect;35.930 of this final rule for certification granted after 1984 because all candidates
certified by AOBR since 1984 will meet the NRC's training requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the public comment period, the Commission also became aware of the need to recognize in &sect;35.930 certification
by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada. This is in addition to the recognition reflected in &sect;&sect;35.900,
35.910, and 35.920 of the proposed rule. A letter dated June 3, 1992, from John E. Glenn (Chief, Medical, Academic and
Commercial Use Safety Branch, Division of Industrial and Medical Nuclear Safety, NRC), to Gilles D. Hurteau of the
Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, stated that certification by the latter is acceptable for approval,
among other things, as an authorized user in &sect;35.300. Therefore, certification by the Royal College of Physicians
and Surgeons of Canada has been added to this section of the final rule.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section was not included in the proposed rule, but has been added to the final rule in response to numerous comments.
This section has been patterned after the provisions in 10 CFR Part 32 for ``grandfathering'' an ``authorized user.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ``grandfather'' an experienced nuclear pharmacist, the licensee needs to apply for a license amendment identifying
that individual as an authorized nuclear pharmacist. The licensee must receive the license amendment before allowing
that individual to work as an authorized nuclear pharmacist. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A licensee seeking to ``grandfather'' a nuclear pharmacist must ensure that the individual has completed a structured
educational program as specified in &sect;35.980(b)(1) on or before (the date of publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and is currently working as a nuclear pharmacist. However, the individual does not need a preceptor statement (&sect;35.980(b)(2))
and the individual's training, specified above, does not need to be within 7 years preceding the date of application
(&sect;35.972).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Agreement State Compatibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There were numerous public comments concerning compatibility. The commenters offered a wide range of opinions,
from those recommending no compatibility to those favoring identical requirements between Agreement States and
the NRC. These comments and NRC's responses will be discussed at the end of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering the comments, the Commission has determined that the compatibility levels for the final rule should
remain the same as the proposed rule. All definitions contained in &sect;&sect;30.4 and 35.2 that are established
or modified by this rulemaking are Division 1 levels of compatibility. These definitions must be the same for all NRC
and Agreement State licensees so that national consistency can be maintained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, &sect;&sect;32.72, 35.6, 35.22(b)(2), 35.25, 35.50, 35.52, 35.53, 35.920, 35.972, 35.980, and
35.981 are Division 2 levels of compatibility because requirements at least this stringent are necessary to ensure
adequate protection of the public health and safety. The Agreement States will be allowed to establish requirements
that are more stringent than the NRC's requirements, but not less stringent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It would be appropriate for Agreement States to adopt the remaining sections of these revisions to Part 35 in this rulemaking,
but it is not necessary to require any degree of compatibility between NRC and the States. Therefore, a Division 3 level
of compatibility is appropriate for these sections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is currently developing a new policy on Agreement State compatibility. This development will include
involvement of the Agreement States and the general public. At the conclusion of this effort, the Commission will
implement guidance on the application of adequacy and compatibility and in light of the new guidance will reassess
the existing compatibility levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission expects Agreement States to adopt rules required to maintain compatibility within 3 years after NRC's
rules become effective. However, the States may elect to implement on a temporary basis the requirements contained
in this final rule through license conditions prior to promulgation of the rule necessary for compatibility. In the
preamble of the notice of the proposed rule, the Commission stated that some Agreement States, faced with administrative
and resource constraints, may find the 3-year time period difficult to attain and may prefer that NRC extend flexibility
in such cases to allow the States to implement the requirements through license conditions. In the same notice, the
Commission requested public comment on permitting Agreement States flexibility in this regard, and if permitted,
under what conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC did not receive any comments on implementing requirements through license conditions. Under current policy,
the Agreement States have the flexibility to implement the requirements contained in this final rule on a temporary
basis through license conditions, until they adopt compatible rules. In addition, this issue will be addressed in
the development of a new policy statement on adequacy and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There were numerous comments related to Agreement State compatibility. These comments and the NRC's responses are
summarized below.

Comment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. It is inappropriate for the NRC to use the existing policy for compatibility determinations regarding this rulemaking
because the NRC is currently considering a new policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Commission must use the existing policy for compatibility determinations regarding all rulemakings until
the new policy becomes effective. At that time, the Commission expects that the existing compatibility determinations
will be reviewed in light of the new policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. There is an increasing tendency of NRC to use the term ``safety significance'' in justifying the NRC's position on
compatibility determination. But the question is, ``How much significance?'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Under the existing policy the Commission considers the safety significance of a particular requirement, i.e.,
whether it is necessary to ensure adequate protection of the public health and safety, in determining whether it should
be an item of Agreement State compatibility. If it is necessary to ensure adequate protection, the requirement will,
at a minimum, be Division 2 level of compatibility. In addition, if the requirement is both necessary for adequate
protection and clear communication, it will be a Division 1 level of compatibility. Using these criteria, the Commission
has made the findings on compatibility described above. The basic objective of these findings is to ensure that the
public receives adequate radiation protection during medical procedures without undue interference in the practices
of pharmacy and medicine. The relationship between compatibility and health and safety will be clarified in the new
policy on Agreement State compatibility.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Some commenters suggested that Agreement States' requirements should be identical to NRC's requirements. Other
commenters suggested that a high degree of consistency between Agreement States and the NRC on medical rules is not
necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Commission believes in some cases, that it is necessary for Agreement States' regulations to be essentially
verbatim, i.e., identical, to NRC regulations. In other cases, it is necessary for the Agreement States to adopt the
provisions in a consistent although not identical form. As discussed above in the response to comment (2), the Commission
has determined which provisions of this rule are a Division 1 level of compatibility. Except for definitions which
are a Division 1 level of compatibility, all other provisions of this final rule are either Division 2 or 3 levels of
compatibility. Thus, for this final rule, uniformity is not required between Agreement States and the NRC for all
provisions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Medical facilities are essentially fixed facilities with little or no implications for interstate commerce. Where
is the justification for the NRC's position? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In the proposed rule, the NRC did not state that the reason for the proposed compatibility levels was due to interstate
commerce implications. As stated earlier, the justifications for compatibility are as follows. All definitions
contained in &sect;&sect;30.4 and 35.2 that are established or modified by this rulemaking are Division 1 levels
of compatibility. These definitions must be the same for all NRC and Agreement State licensees so that national consistency
can be maintained. Also, certain specific sections are Division 2 levels of compatibility because requirements
at least this stringent are necessary to ensure adequate protection of the public health and safety.

 The proposed rule stated that all definitions in &sect;&sect;30.4 and 35.2 would be Division 1 levels of compatibility.
This would include definitions in &sect;30.4 that do not relate to medical uses and should not be affected by this rulemaking.

 The language in the preamble for the proposed rule intended to indicate that all definitions in &sect;&sect;30.4
and 35.2 that are established or modified by this rulemaking would be Division 1 levels of compatibility. Levels of
compatibility for other definitions in existing &sect;&sect;30.4 and 35.2 that are not modified in this rulemaking
will remain unchanged. The language in this preamble has been modified to clarify this point.

Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Before the quality management program and misadministration rulemaking became effective, all sections in Part
35 were Division 3 levels of compatibility. However, following that amendment (56 FR 34104; July 25, 1991), the levels
of compatibility for Part 35 were modified as follows: The definitions associated with the quality management rule
and misadministrations in &sect;35.2 became Division 1 levels of compatibility; &sect;&sect;35.32 and 35.33 became
Division 2 levels of compatibility; &sect;35.8 became a Division 4 level of compatibility; and all other sections
of Part 35 remained Division 3 levels of compatibility.

The proposed rule stated that Agreement States are expected to adopt rules required to maintain compatibility within
3 years. Agreement States should be able to adopt this rulemaking in a shorter time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Some Agreement States may need less time to adopt certain parts of this rulemaking. Other Agreement States may need
the full 3 years to adopt the rule because of constraints on resources. Therefore, the Commission retains the 3-year
period for adopting this rule. In reevaluating its compatibility policy, the Commission is considering whether
the time can be shortened when demonstrable health and safety considerations require it.

 What would happen if an Agreement State fails to adopt requirements that are items of compatibility? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 During the periodic review of the Agreement State's program, the NRC would determine whether the State meets the compatibility
requirements. If not, the State would be notified that its program must be compatible with the NRC's requirements,
and using current procedures a finding of compatibility for the Agreement State program would be withheld. Such a
failure, if uncorrected or unjustified, could lead to the loss of the State's status as an Agreement State.

 Creating a Division 1 or Division 2 level of compatibility for parts of this rule may cause conflict with State boards
of pharmacy and medicine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The provisions contained in this rulemaking that require a Division 1 or Division 2 level of compatibility are necessary
to provide an adequate level of protection of public health and safety from radiological hazards. In addition, the
Commission is not aware of any conflicts between these provisions and the requirements of State boards of pharmacy
and medicine.

Finding of No Significant Environmental Impact: Availability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has determined under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and the Commission's
regulations in Subpart A of 10 CFR Part 51, that this final amendment is not a major Federal action significantly affecting
the quality of the human environment, and therefore an environmental impact statement is not required. The final
amendment provides greater flexibility for physician authorized users to use byproduct material in the practice
of medicine. The final amendment will also incorporate into the regulations the concept of authorized nuclear pharmacists
to permit properly qualified pharmacists to prepare radioactive drugs containing byproduct material in the practice
of pharmacy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule will allow physician authorized users greater discretion to prepare and use radioactive drugs containing
byproduct material. The final rule will also allow authorized nuclear pharmacists greater discretion to prepare
radioactive drugs containing byproduct material. It is expected that there will be no increase in radiation exposure
to the public or to the environment beyond the exposures currently resulting from delivering the byproduct material
or radiation from byproduct material to patients or human research subjects. The environmental assessment and finding
of no significant impact on which this determination is based is available for inspection at the NRC Public Document
Room, 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC. Single copies of the environmental assessment and the finding
of no significant impact are available from Anthony N. Tse (see

The reduction in public burden for this collection of information is estimated to be a savings of 408 hours per year
for 300 NRC licensees, or an average 1.4 hours per year per licensee, including the time for reviewing instructions,
searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection
of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information,
including suggestions for reducing this burden, to the Information and Records Management Branch (T&hyph;6 F33),
U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and to the Desk Officer, Office of Information and Regulatory
Affairs, NEOB&hyph;10202, (3150&hyph;0001, -0010, and -0120), Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has prepared a final regulatory analysis on this regulation. The analysis examines the benefits and
impacts considered by the Commission. No public comments were received on the draft regulatory analysis associated
with the proposed rule. The final regulatory analysis is available for inspection at the NRC Public Document Room
at 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC. Single copies of the draft analysis are available from Anthony
N. Tse (see

Regulatory Flexibility Certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commission certifies that this rule will
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule affects medical use licensees
including some private practice physicians. Some of these licensees would be considered small entities under the
NRC's size standards (56 FR 56671; November 6, 1991). The amendments provide greater discretion for physician authorized
users to use byproduct material in the practice of medicine. The amendments will also incorporate into the regulations
the concept of authorized nuclear pharmacists to allow properly qualified pharmacists greater discretion to prepare
(including compound) radioactive drugs containing byproduct material for medical use. This rule is expected to
reduce regulatory burdens on medical use licensees, including small entities. No public comments were received
related to the regulatory flexibility certification associated with the proposed rule.

Backfit Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has determined that the backfit rule, 10 CFR 50.109, does not apply to this amendment because this amendment
does not involve any provisions which would impose backfits as defined in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(1). Therefore, a backfit
analysis is not required for this amendment.

Manufacture, preparation, or transfer for commercial distribution of radioactive drugs containing byproduct
material for medical use under Part 35. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) An application for a specific license to manufacture, prepare, or transfer for commercial distribution radioactive
drugs containing byproduct material for use by persons authorized pursuant to Part 35 of this chapter will be approved
if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The applicant satisfies the general requirements specified in 10 CFR 30.33; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The applicant submits evidence that the applicant is at least one of the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Registered or licensed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a drug manufacturer; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Registered or licensed with a state agency as a drug manufacturer; (iii) Licensed as a pharmacy by a State Board
of Pharmacy; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Operating as a nuclear pharmacy within a Federal medical institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The applicant submits information on the radionuclide; the chemical and physical form; the maximum activity
per vial, syringe, generator, or other container of the radioactive drug; and the shielding provided by the packaging
to show it is appropriate for the safe handling and storage of the radioactive drugs by medical use licensees; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A label is affixed to each container of a radioactive drug to be transferred for commercial distribution. The label
must include the name of the radioactive drug or its abbreviation, quantity of radioactivity, and date and time of
assay. For radioactive drugs with a half life greater than 100 days the time of assay may be omitted. In addition, the
label for the syringe or syringe radiation shield must also contain the clinical procedure to be performed or the patient's
or the human research subject's name. Furthermore, the label, or the leaflet or brochure that accompanies the radioactive
drug, must contain a statement that the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has approved distribution of the byproduct
material to persons licensed to use byproduct material pursuant to 10 CFR 35.100, 35.200, or 35.300, as appropriate,
and to persons who hold an equivalent license issued by an Agreement State. The Commission's labeling requirements
are independent of requirements of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA); one label is acceptable to NRC provided
that it contains all of the information which NRC requires. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A licensee described by paragraph (a)(2)(iii) or (iv) of this section: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) May prepare radioactive drugs for medical use, as defined in 10 CFR 35.2, provided that the radioactive drug is
prepared by either an authorized nuclear pharmacist, as specified in paragraph (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section,
or an individual under the supervision of an authorized nuclear pharmacist as specified in 10 CFR 35.25. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) May allow a pharmacist to work as an authorized nuclear pharmacist if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(5) Shall provide to the Commission a copy of each individual's certification by the Board of Pharmaceutical Specialties,
the Commission or Agreement State license, or the permit issued by a licensee of broad scope, and a copy of the state
pharmacy licensure or registration, no later than 30 days after the date that the licensee allows, pursuant to paragraphs
(b)(2)(i) and (b)(2)(iii) of this section, the individual to work as an authorized nuclear pharmacist.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) A licensee shall possess and use instrumentation to measure the radioactivity of radioactive drugs. The licensee
shall have procedures for use of the instrumentation. The licensee shall measure, by direct measurement or by combination
of measurements and calculations, the amount of radioactivity in dosages of alpha-, beta-, or photon-emitting radioactive
drugs prior to transfer for commercial distribution. In addition, the licensee shall:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Perform tests before initial use, periodically, and following repair, on each instrument for accuracy, linearity,
and geometry dependence, as appropriate for the use of the instrument; and make adjustments when necessary; and

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Board is publishing an interim rule amending Regulation E (Electronic Fund Transfers). The amendment eliminates
the requirement that an electronic terminal receipt disclose a number or code that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
uniquely
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 identifies the consumer, the consumer's account, or the access device. This requirement currently poses a significant
security risk for consumers and financial institutions by making information accessible to criminals that they
then use to withdraw funds from consumers' accounts. The Board has adopted an interim rule that deletes the requirement
for a unique identification, thus enabling institutions to truncate card or account numbers. The Board seeks public
comment on the interim rule, which the Board will adopt in final following the close of the comment period.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board's Regulation E implements the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA). The EFTA provides a basic framework
establishing the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of participants in electronic fund transfer (EFT)
systems. Types of transfers covered by the act and regulation include transfers initiated through an automated teller
machine (ATM), point-of-sale terminal, automated clearinghouse, telephone bill-payment system, or home banking
program. Regulation E establishes restrictions on the unsolicited issuance of ATM cards and other access devices;
requires disclosure of terms and conditions of an EFT service; calls for documentation of EFTs through terminal receipts
and periodic account statements; provides limitations on consumer liability for unauthorized transfers; and establishes
procedures for error resolution.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 205.9_Documentation of Transfers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (a)_Receipts at Electronic Terminals
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the EFTA, when a consumer initiates an EFT at an electronic terminal, the financial institution must make a written
receipt available to the consumer. The receipt must identify in some way the consumer's account with the financial
institution from or to which funds are transferred.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Board's Regulation E, institutions can comply with this identification requirement by including a number
or code on the receipt that identifies the access device used to initiate the transfer, the consumer initiating the
transaction, or the consumer's accounts. To ensure adequate identification, the Board's regulation specifies
that the number or code should be ``unique.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This identification requirement was adopted in 1979, and over the years many financial institutions have met the
requirement by disclosing consumers' card or account numbers on the receipt; until recently, doing so did not appear
to represent a security risk for financial institutions. Now, a large number of institutions are reporting that the
requirement for a unique identification poses a significant security risk for consumers and financial institutions.
These institutions, together with trade associations, have asked that the Board revise the rule to prevent ATM fraud
by persons who observe_and often videotape_a consumer entering a personal identification number (PIN) on the ATM
keypad. These persons retrieve terminal receipts that have been discarded at ATM locations to obtain the consumer's
account or ATM card number. They then manufacture a counterfeit ATM card and use the combination of PIN and card withdraw
funds from the consumer's account. One estimate places the industry losses at an annual cost between 25 and 40 million
dollars, and climbing; others believe this estimate is understated. Data verifying the extent of institutions'
fraud losses due to this problem are publicly unavailable because the data are proprietary in nature. But several
large financial institutions indicate they have sustained losses of as much as a million dollars in one week.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Institutions say that truncating the consumer's account or card number on the receipt would help to counter the problem.
Under the current receipt provision in Regulation E, however, they cannot readily do so because of the likelihood
that the identification number on the receipt no longer would be ``unique'' among the institution's customers. Institutions
have considered other ways to reduce risk, including retrofitting terminals to uniquely identify a consumer by a
means other than a card or account number. Another approach would be for the terminal to give customers the option not
to receive a receipt, for customers who might otherwise tend to discard their receipts at the ATM. While these approaches
could help reduce fraud, they would be extremely costly to implement. Educational efforts to encourage consumers
not to discard their receipts at the ATM site generally have been unsuccessful.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The interim rule eliminates the requirement for a unique number or code, and thus allows institutions to truncate
the account or card number disclosed on ATM receipts. With a truncated number, it becomes less feasible for a criminal
to duplicate a card with an account number that matches the consumer's PIN. For the consumer's purposes, the printed
number would continue to provide enough information for the consumer (and the financial institution) to identify
the transaction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board believes that the change will not substantially diminish consumer protections. The purpose of the receipt
requirement is to allow consumers to verify transactions. Under the amendment, the receipt will still provide sufficient
information to allow the consumer to identify transfers: the date of the transfer; the amount of the transfer; the
type of transfer and type of account; the location of the terminal; and identification of any third party to or from
which funds are transferred. Using this information, a consumer could match each transaction on the periodic statement
with the receipt received at the time the transaction took place. In addition, a consumer would have the necessary
information to identify and resolve errors in documentation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ordinarily the Board publishes proposed rules for a public comment period before their adoption. In the present case,
the Board believes the situation represents a serious fraud problem for consumers and financial institutions, and
that it is important to act expeditiously in amending the current rule. The Board believes also that the amendment
being adopted will reduce fraud without compromising consumers' ability to identify their EFT transactions at ATMs.
Delay in the adoption of this amendment would cause continued losses to consumers and financial institutions, which
is contrary to the public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the amendment relieves the restriction that the account number be ``unique,'' and does not require
institutions to take any action to implement the amended regulation. Modification of the identification number
on the receipt is discretionary to the institution. Thus, the Board finds that good cause exists for the adoption of
an interim rule without prior comment, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B)). Accordingly,
the Board is adopting an interim rule that takes effect immediately, and publishing that interim rule for public comment
for a 60-day period, after which the Board will adopt a final rule that takes into account any comment that may be received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendment to Regulation E set forth below does not expressly refer to truncation of the account number. The Board
notes, however, that it plans to codify the permissibility of truncation in the Official Staff Commentary to Regulation
E, following the Board's final action on this interim rule. (This amendment of Regulation E supersedes a proposed
change under the regulatory review project that was published for comment earlier this year (59 FR 10684, March 7,
1994).)

Comment letters should refer to Docket No. R&hyph;0859. The Board requests that, when possible, comments be prepared
using a standard ``Courier'' typeface with a type size of 10 or 12 characters per inch. This will enable the Board to
convert the text into machine-readable form through electronic scanning, and will facilitate automated retrieval
of comments for review. Comments may also be submitted on computer diskettes, using either the 3.5

IV. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis and Paperwork Reduction Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendment to Regulation E will provide more flexibility to financial institutions in complying with the EFT Act
requirements for identifying a transaction on receipts provided at electronic terminals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 3507 of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 35; 5 CFR 1320.13), the revision will
be reviewed by the Board under the authority delegated to the Board by the Office of Management and Budget after consideration
of comment received during the public comment period. Nevertheless, given that the amendment provides for more flexibility
in complying with the law, the Board believes there is a negligible impact on the paperwork burden for state member
banks and institutions supervised by other agencies.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Pratt &amp; Whitney (PW) JT8D series turbofan
engines, that requires installation and periodic inspection of temperature indicators installed on the No. 4 and
5 bearing compartment scavenge oil tube and performance of any necessary corrective action. This amendment is prompted
by reports of high pressure turbine (HPT) shaft fractures caused by oil fires that resulted from internal leakage
of thirteenth stage compressor discharge air into the No. 4 and 5 bearing compartment. The actions specified by this
AD are intended to prevent fracture of the HPT shaft, which can result in uncontained release of engine fragments,
engine fire, inflight engine shutdown, or possible aircraft damage.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to Pratt &amp; Whitney (PW) JT8D series turbofan engines, was published as a notice of proposed
rulemaking (NPRM) in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 24, 1992 (57 FR 2857). That action proposed to require the installation and periodic inspection of temperature
indicators (temp tabs) installed on the No. 4 and 5 bearing compartment scavenge oil tube, performance of any necessary
corrective action, and to require the installation of No. 4 and 5 bearing compartment hardware modifications for
certain engines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 19, 1993, the FAA issued a Supplemental NPRM (58 FR 40083, July 27, 1993) that reopened the comment period, due
to comments received and the determination that the bearing compartment hardware modifications do not adequately
prevent internal leakage of thirteenth stage compressor discharge air into the No. 4 and 5 bearing compartment. That
Supplemental NPRM proposed to require installation of improved temperature indicators to extend the compliance
time for installation of temperature indicators, and to eliminate the requirement to perform No. 4 and 5 bearing compartment
hardware modifications, in accordance with PW Alert Service Bulletin (ASB) No. 5944, Revision 2, dated June 8, 1992,
and ASB No. 6053, Revision 7, dated May 24, 1993.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter states that PW JT8D-Std series turbofan engines installed in Boeing 727 series aircraft should be exempt
from the requirements of the AD based on the absence of uncontained engine failures over the last 16 years for those
engines. The FAA concurs. The FAA has determined that the risk of uncontained engine failures on PW JT8D-Std series
turbofan engines installed in Boeing 727 series aircraft has been reducing as newer model engines with improved containment
capability have been accumulating an increasing percentage of fleet operating hours. Based on this determination,
the FAA has concluded that a mandatory requirement to install the temperature indicators on these engines cannot
be justified. Therefore, this final rule has been revised to remove from the applicability PW JT8D-Std series engines.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter states that the repetitive inspections and associated record keeping should be incorporated into
the operators' FAA-approved maintenance program. The FAA does not concur. The FAA has determined that it is necessary
to keep the repetitive inspections under the AD and separate from the routine-approved maintenance program to distinguish
this activity as being critical to flight safety. In addition, this AD represents an interim program until installation
of the HPT containment hardware in PW JT8D&hyph;200 series turbofan engines has been accomplished in accordance
with AD 93&hyph;23&hyph;10. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters state that the temp tab installation requirement should be extended beyond the current 90 days. The
FAA does not concur. The FAA has provided ample notice of this requirement and extension of the installation grace
period will increase the probability of a No. 4 and 5 bearing compartment fire and possible shaft fracture. In addition,
this 90 day grace period represents an increase from 65 days proposed in the NPRM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters state that the repetitive inspection interval should be changed from 65 hours time in service (TIS)
to a longer interval or an interval based on calendar time. The FAA does not concur. Extension of this interval will
increase the probability of a No. 4 and 5 compartment fire to an unacceptable level. This interval represents a maximum
limit, and shorter intervals can be selected to be consistent with calendar time maintenance schedules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter states that temp tabs are unreliable and are subject to oil contamination and false indications, and
that the program should be delayed until a new indicating method is developed. The FAA does not concur. The temp tab
configuration specified in this rule and associated PW SB represent an improved version that incorporates a sealant
which is applied over the indicator and prevents oil saturation. In addition, a procedure to determine if oil saturation
has occurred is included in the associated PW SB. PW has developed a more costly mechanical pop-up indicator that is
resistant to oil contamination. Introduction of this indicator is currently under evaluation and it may be available
as an alternate means of compliance at a future date.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters state that the cost impact does not take into account the expense of maintaining the temp tab indicators
and the costs of troubleshooting false indications, and that, therefore, the total cost estimate for compliance
with the AD should be increased to reflect these indirect costs. The FAA does not concur. The economic analysis reflects
the direct cost of compliance with the requirements of the AD actions that the FAA has determined are necessary to correct
an unsafe condition likely to exist on engines of this type design. The FAA has determined that adherence to the temp
tab indicator installation instructions provided in PW SB No. 5944 will allow for reliable installation of the indicators.
Once installed correctly, the temp tab indicators will provide warning of potentially catastrophic and costly abnormal
engine conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter states that the temp tab indicator part numbers should not be stated in the AD. The commenter maintains
that the AD would then still be applicable for improved indicators with new part numbers when they are introduced.
The FAA does not concur. A new revision to PW SB No. 5944 would be required to introduce new part numbers for new temp tab
indicators, and the FAA may approve the new revision and installation of these new temp tab indicators as an alternative
method of compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter states that utilizing oil system condition monitoring and checks should allow for an increased temp
tab indicator inspection interval. The FAA does not concur. The FAA has determined that the temp tab indicators are
the most effective indicator of No. 4 and 5 bearing compartment overtemperature conditions. However, other oil system
checks, such as oil consumption monitoring, breather pressure, and oil pressure, can be used to assist in the troubleshooting
process and help identify bearing compartment overtemperature conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter agrees with the rule as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes described previously. The FAA has determined
that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 2,432 PW JT8D&hyph;200 series engines of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The
FAA estimates that 1,044 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take
approximately 1.5 work hours per engine to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55
per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $85,883. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc. Model 206A,
206B, 206L, 206L&hyph;1, and 206L&hyph;3 helicopters, that requires a one-time inspection for cracks in the tail
rotor drive shaft hanger bearing support brackets (brackets), and repair or replacement, as necessary. This amendment
is prompted by reports of cracks in the bend radius of the brackets. The actions specified by this AD are intended to
prevent misalignment of the tail rotor drive shaft, failure of the tail rotor drive shaft system, loss of control of
the tail rotor, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc. Model 206A, 206B, 206L, 206L&hyph;1, and 206L&hyph;3 helicopters
was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on September 21, 1993 (58 FR 48989). That action proposed to require a one-time inspection for cracks of tail rotor
drive shaft hanger bearing support brackets (brackets), and repair or replacement, as necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments
were received on the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. However, in the cost/benefit analysis
section of the preamble, the average labor rate has been changed from the proposed rate of $55 per work hour to the more
current rate of $60 per work hour. This rate change increases the proposed estimated total cost of $1,265,000 by $55,000
to $1,320,000. Additionally, there have been some editorial changes made to the proposal. The FAA has determined
that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed with the changes noted. Although
the labor rate and, correspondingly, the estimated total cost amounts have been changed to reflect the more current
labor rate, these changes have been made to the preamble information and not to the proposed regulatory requirements
of the AD. The FAA has determined that the editorial changes made to the regulatory requirements of the rule will neither
increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 5,500 helicopters of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately
2 work hours per helicopter to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour.
Required parts will cost approximately $120 per helicopter. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD
on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,320,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

Two commenters support the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters request that the compliance time for installing the spoiler mixer bracket retainers be extended
from the proposed 12 months to 18 or 24 months. These commenters state that such an extension will allow operators to
accomplish the installations during a regularly scheduled heavy maintenance visit. This will reduce the impact
of non&hyph;scheduled maintenance and removal of aircraft from service, and prevent the consequent inconvenience
to the traveling public. The commenters point out that safety will not be compromised by extending the compliance
time, since the repetitive inspections of the mixer bracket assembly at intervals of 1,500 cycles, as are currently
required by AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;03, will maintain the structural integrity of the mixer bracket assembly in the interim.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA concurs that the compliance time can be extended somewhat. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA's intent was that the inspections be conducted during a regularly scheduled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintenance visit for the majority of the affected fleet, when the airplanes would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
located at a base where special equipment and trained personnel would be readily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available, if necessary. Based on the information supplied by the commenters, the FAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
now recognizes that 18 months corresponds more closely to the interval representative of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most of the affected operators' normal maintenance schedules. Paragraph (a) of the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule has been revised to reflect a compliance time of 18 months. The FAA does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider that this extension will adversely affect safety, since the mandatory repetitive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspections of the area, as required by AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;03 will ensure that any discrepancies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be identified and corrected in the interim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has recently reviewed the figures it has used over the past several years 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in calculating the economic impact of AD activity. In order to account for various 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inflationary costs in the airline industry, the FAA has determined that it is necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase the labor rate used in these calculations from $55 per work hour to $60 per work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hour. The economic impact information below has been revised to reflect this increase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the specified hourly labor rate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ATA) of America, the FAA has learned that, in general, some operators may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misunderstand the legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision of the AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AD. Under these circumstances, at least one operator appears to have incorrectly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumed that its airplane was not subject to an AD. On the contrary, all airplanes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally subject to the AD. If an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplane has been altered or repaired in the affected area in such a way as to affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required to obtain FAA approval for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the paragraph of each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been added to this final rule to clarify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this requirement.]

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined that these changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 427 Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10, &hyph;15, &hyph;30, and &hyph;40 series airplanes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimates that 241 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately 3 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average labor rate is $60 per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $6,497 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimated to be $1,609,157, or $6,677 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 114 Model MD&hyph;11 series airplanes of the affected design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 46 airplanes of U.S. registry will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected by this AD, that it would take approximately 3 work hours per airplane to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Required parts would cost approximately $6,497 per airplane. Based on these figures, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators of Model MD&hyph;11 series airplanes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is estimated to be $307,142, or $6,677 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the figures discussed above, the total cost impact of this AD on U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators is $1,916,299. This total cost impact figure is based on assumptions that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted.

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment supersedes Airworthiness Directive (AD) 87&hyph;04&hyph;04 and AD 89&hyph;16&hyph;02, which
currently require the following on Jetstream Aircraft Limited (JAL) HP 137 Mk1, Jetstream series 200, and Jetstream
Models 3101 and 3201 airplanes: repetitively inspecting the universal joints and universal rivets, replacing any
damaged part, and limiting the in-service life of the torque tube shaft assembly. JAL has introduced an improved flap
torque tube shaft assembly that includes universal joints that are not life limited. The Federal Aviation Administration's
policy on aging commuter-class aircraft is to eliminate or, in certain instances, reduce the number of certain repetitive
short-interval inspections when improved parts or modifications are available. This action requires installing
this improved flap torque shaft assembly in place of the repetitive inspection and life limit requirements of the
two existing AD's. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent failure of the flap torque assembly, which
could result in asymmetric flap deployment and loss of control of the airplane.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an AD that would apply to certain
JAL HP 137 Mk1, Jetstream series 200, and Jetstream Models 3101 and 3201 airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 12, 1994 (59 FR 35490). The action proposed to supersede both AD 87&hyph;04&hyph;04 and AD 89&hyph;16&hyph;02
with a new AD that would require installing this improved flap torque shaft assembly in place of the repetitive inspection
and life limit requirements of the two existing AD's. The proposed actions would be accomplished in accordance with
Jetstream Aircraft Limited Service Bulletin No. 27&hyph;JA 920340. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments
were received on the proposed rule or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of all available information, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest
require the adoption of the rule as proposed except for minor editorial corrections. The FAA has determined that these
minor corrections will not change the meaning of the AD nor add any additional burden upon the public than was already
proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action is based on the FAA's aging commuter-class aircraft policy. This policy simply states that airplane owners/operators
should incorporate a known design change when it could eliminate, or, in certain instances, reduce the number of critical
repetitive inspections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule action has an effective date of approximately 12 months after publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and a compliance time of 50 hours time-in-service after the effective date. This will allow operators time to schedule
the flap torque shaft assembly replacement. The requirements of AD 87&hyph;04&hyph;04 and AD 89&hyph;16&hyph;02
will still apply until the effective date of this AD or until the installation or modification required by this AD is
accomplished, whichever occurs first.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA estimates that 245 airplanes in the U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately 31 workhours per airplane to accomplish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the required action, and that the average labor rate is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately $55 an hour. Parts cost approximately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$1,010 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost impact of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be $665,175. This figure is based on the assumption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that no affected airplane operator has accomplished the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required actions. In addition, this action eliminates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the need for the repetitive inspections required by AD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
87&hyph;04&hyph;04 and AD 89&hyph;16&hyph;02. The FAA has no way of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining the operation levels of each individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator of the affected airplanes, and subsequently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cannot determine the repetitive inspection costs that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be eliminated by the required action. The FAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimates these costs to be substantial over the long-term. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial direct effects on the States, on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relationship between the national government and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, or on the distribution of power and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibilities among the various levels of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not have a significant economic impact, positive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or negative, on a substantial number of small entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A copy of the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Defense Production Act Amendments of 1992 amended the Defense Production Act of 1950 (the Act). The Act now requires
that U.S. firms entering into contracts for the sale of defense articles or defense services to foreign countries
or foreign firms that are subject to offset agreements exceeding $5,000,000 in value to furnish information regarding
such sales to the Secretary of Commerce (the Secretary). The Act also now requires the Secretary to establish regulations
to collect this information and to protect it from public disclosure unless public disclosure is specifically authorized
by the firm furnishing the information. The Act further requires the Secretary to serve as the President's executive
agent in preparing an annual report to Congress on the impact of offsets on the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 This report will include an aggregated summary of information provided to the Secretary by U.S. industry pursuant
to the regulation provided here. It will address the impact of offsets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the defense preparedness, industrial competitiveness, employment, and trade of the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 On April 26, 1994, BXA published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 21678) a proposed rule on reporting of offsets in military exports designed to elicit comments, suggestions,
information, or advice relative to the proposed regulation. 20 responses were received commenting on the proposed
rule. The two major comments concerned the requirements to submit semi-annual reports and to report each individual
transaction undertaken to fulfill an offset commitment. The rule has been amended to address these concerns.

Rulemaking Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. This rule has been determined to be ``significant'' for purposes of Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 2. This rule involves collections of information subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et
seq.). These collections have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 940364&hyph;4212.
Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to be 5 to 60 hours per response, with an average
of 10 hours, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining
the data needed, and completing and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reviewing the collection of information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism
assessment under Executive Order 12612. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 4. The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce has certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business
Administration that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
It is anticipated that the rule will primarily affect large defense contractors that engage in offset agreements
with foreign governments. Moreover, the rule is not expected to pose a burden because firms engaging in offset transactions
already must prepare periodic accounts of progress toward fulfillment of offset obligations for the foreign entity
that is party to the offset agreement. The information to be collected pursuant to these regulations is less than that
required by these foreign parties. With regard to new offset agreements entered into, the information requested
is readily available and will take a minimum amount of time to assemble by the parties involved.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Defense Production Act Amendments of 1992 require the Secretary of Commerce to promulgate regulations for U.S.
firms entering into contracts for the sale of defense articles or defense services to foreign countries or foreign
firms that are subject to offset agreements exceeding $5,000,000 in value to furnish information regarding such
agreements. The Secretary of Commerce has designated the Bureau of Export Administration as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the organization responsible for implementing this provision. The information provided by U.S. firms will be aggregated
and used to determine the impact of offset transactions on the defense preparedness, industrial competitiveness,
employment, and trade of the United States. Summary reports will be submitted annually to the Congress pursuant Section
309 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended.

for which the contract is subject to an offset agreement exceeding $5,000,000 in value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) This rule applies to all offset transactions completed in performance of existing offset commitments since January

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) To avoid double counting, firms should report only offset transactions for which they are directly responsible

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Reports should be delivered to the Offsets Program Manager, U.S. Department of Commerce, Office of Strategic
Industries and Economic Security, Bureau of Export Administration, Room 3878, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue,
N.W., Washington DC 20230. The first industry reports should be submitted to the Bureau of Export Administration
not later than March 15, 1995 and should cover offset transactions completed during the calendar year 1993, as well
as information regarding unfulfilled offset agreements. After this initial submission, companies should provide
information once yearly not later than June 15 covering the preceding calendar year. All submissions should include
a point of contact (name and telephone number) and should be by a company official authorized to provide such information.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Companies may submit this information in computerized spreadsheet/database format (e.g., Lotus 1&hyph;2&hyph;3,

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document amends the Customs Regulations to establish a conditional release period of 180 days on entries of textiles
and textile products for the sole purpose of facilitating a determination as to whether the country of origin of the
entered goods has been accurately represented to Customs. This amendment will permit Customs to issue Notices of
Redelivery to importers of textiles and textile products within 30 days after the end of the conditional release period
if investigation or information reveals that the merchandise was claimed to originate in a country where little or
no manufacturing processes occurred in order to avoid quota or visa admissibility requirements. An importer who
fails to redeliver the merchandise to Customs custody would be liable for liquidated damages under the terms of the
Basic Importation and Entry Bond.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On March 30, 1994, Customs published a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 14808) which proposed to amend Part 141 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR Part 141) to provide for a conditional
release period of 180 days on all textiles and textile products that are subject to the provisions of section 204, Agricultural
Act of 1956, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1854). The notice referred to the significant enforcement problem regarding textiles
and textile products that are imported into the United States in violation of quota restrictions or without the appropriate
visa from the country of origin. The notice stated that this problem involves merchandise that is the product of a country
to which stringent quotas or visa requirements apply and that is transshipped through a second country having less
rigorous quota and visa standards, often in order to facilitate the making of a false claim, upon importation into
the United States, that the merchandise is a product of the country through which it was transshipped and therefore
subject to the more lenient quota and visa entry standards applicable to products of that country. The notice pointed
out two principal obstacles to effective enforcement efforts in such cases: (1) While the penalty provisions of section
592 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1592), are in principle available for assessment against any party
who has committed fraud, gross negligence or negligence in connection with the entry of such transshipped merchandise,
it is not always possible to establish the requisite culpability; and (2) the other alternative, namely the issuance
of a Notice of Redelivery followed by the issuance of a claim for liquidated damages for a failure to redeliver, is often
not available because in many cases the violation is discovered only after the close of the time period provided in
the regulations for issuance of a Notice of Redelivery (for textiles and textile products and other merchandise for
which a conditional release period is not specified in the regulations, issuance must be within 30 days of the release
of the merchandise from Customs custody).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to address these problems, Customs proposed to amend &sect;141.113 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR 141.113)
by adding a new paragraph (b) to provide for a specific conditional release period of 180 days from the date of release
for all textiles and textile products subject to section 204 of the Agricultural Act of 1956. Thus, under the terms
of &sect;113.62(d) of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR 113.62(d)), Customs would then have up to 30 days from the end
of the conditional release period to issue a Notice of Redelivery whenever it is determined that a textile or textile
product is not entitled to admission into the commerce of the United States. Failure to redeliver merchandise within
the time period specified in the Notice of Redelivery (generally 30 days from the date of the Notice) would result in
the assessment of a claim for liquidated damages under the Basic Importation and Entry Bond as provided in &sect;113.62(k)
of the regulations. In addition, the notice set forth proposed conforming changes to &sect;141.113 as a consequence
of the addition of the proposed new paragraph (b). The notice invited the public to submit written comments on the proposals,
and the public comment period closed on May 31, 1994.

Analysis of Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Twenty-seven comments were received. Four of the commenters were entirely in favor of the proposed regulatory amendments
as written and suggested no changes. Twenty-three commenters opposed the proposals. The comments in opposition
are discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All of the commenters opposing the proposed rule indicated that the proposed conditional release period of 180 days
on all textile importations did not take into account the commercial reality of textile importation and distribution.
Textile and apparel sales are subject to seasonal requirements and stylistic variables, and the commenters charged
that it would be commercially untenable to maintain on hand seven months worth of inventory in order to be insulated
from any liability for possible redelivery violations. Many of the commenters noted that they operate in a ``just
in time'' environment so that as little inventory as possible remains on hand. It was generally agreed upon by the negative
commenters that the proposed rule would impose a significant economic burden on the legitimate importer but that
the nefarious importer would continue to operate without regard for any possible consequence.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Customs response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Customs recognizes that some potential economic risk would result from the establishment of the 180-day conditional
release period. As noted in the analysis of the following comment made with regard to the proposal, Customs acknowledges
the potential economic hardship that might be caused by a sweeping regulation and, therefore, has drawn the conditions
upon which redelivery can be based narrowly so as to affect as few entries as possible. In weighing the economic harm
caused by illegally transshipped goods against the potential liability incurred by an importer because of the extension
of the 30-day redelivery period, Customs believes that this objection to the proposed amendment does not constitute
a sufficient basis for not proceeding with a final rule on this matter.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All of the commenters opposed to the proposed regulation stated that it was overly broad, noting that the proposed
text would apply a 180-day conditional release period to all textile and apparel entries on any issue of admissibility,
including issues of classification, valuation or duty assessment. The following observation was typical of the
comments submitted on this point: Although the release period modification was intended to address the assumed abundance
of transshipment violations, importers may be exposed to liability merely for instances of classification/quota
category disputes; Customs will therefore have the opportunity to penalize importers for matters independent of
the intentions of the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Customs response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Customs agrees that the sweep of the proposed regulation is too broad. Accordingly, the regulatory text in question,
as set forth below, has been redrafted to establish a conditional release period of 180 days for textiles and textile
products only for purposes of determining whether a transshipment violation has occurred. This narrowing of the
scope of the regulation will serve to alleviate many of the concerns of risk raised by the commenters. The 180-day period
would not be applicable to issues of classification, valuation or other issues of admissibility not related to a transshipment
violation.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters suggested that the proposed rule directly violates section 621 of the Customs Modernization (hereinafter
the ``Mod Act'') provisions contained in Title VI of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (Public
Law 103&hyph;182, 107 Stat. 2057). These commenters asserted that under the Mod Act provisions and the intent of the
Congress expressed therein, an importer is held to a standard of ``reasonable care'' in discharging those entry and
related activities for which he is responsible. Failure to maintain that standard will result in assessment of penalties
for violation of the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 1592. The commenters claimed that Customs, through liquidated damages
assessment, is gutting the reasonable care concept and imposing a strict liability standard on a situation which
Customs admits cannot be sanctioned through a 1592 action due to a failure of proof.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Customs response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Customs does not agree with this analysis. By acting as importer of record, an importer or broker knowingly accepts
the terms of the Basic Importation and Entry Bond. When a transshipment violation occurs, the importation of violative
goods into the United States results. Compensation for that harm, which is the purpose of a liquidated damage claim,
is not readily quantifiable and need not be based upon a finding of culpability.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Liability under section 1592 is based upon a finding of culpability and is not limited to the importer of the goods.
The penalty provisions reach importers, brokers, manufacturers, shippers, and the like, and may also include aiders
and abettors of violations. These penalties serve to punish violators and deter future violative conduct but they
do not serve to compensate the Government for harm. It is inapposite to impose standards of reasonable care promulgated
by the Mod Act to a bond violation situation. Customs does not believe that the proposed regulation is in conflict with
the Mod Act and therefore sees no reason to modify or withdraw the proposed rule based on this comment.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters suggested that imposition of liquidated damages equal to three times the value of merchandise
which is not redelivered serves to punish rather than compensate when the violation involves illegal transshipment
of textile merchandise. These commenters noted that an importer could be found to be negligent and incur a 1592 penalty
but pay considerably less than a three-times-the-value-of-the-merchandise claim assessed as liquidated damages.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Customs response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Illegally transshipped textile merchandise, while prohibited in nature, does not cause a health or safety hazard
to the general public. Accordingly, Customs agrees with the thrust of this comment and, therefore, the regulatory
text as set forth below, has been redrafted to limit any liquidated damages assessment for transshipment violations
to the value of the merchandise involved in the breach.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly, for the above reasons, Customs has determined that the proposed regulatory changes should be adopted
as a final rule, subject to the textual modifications to the proposed regulatory text as discussed in the above comment
analysis and as set forth below.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), it is certified that the regulatory amendments will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. Establishment of a conditional release period for textiles and textile products, which is necessary
for law enforcement purposes, will affect only the relatively small percentage of importers who import such merchandise
contrary to law. Accordingly, the amendments are not subject to the regulatory analysis or other requirements of
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604.

 For purposes of determining whether the country of origin of textiles and textile products subject to the provisions
of &sect;12.130 of this chapter has been accurately represented to Customs, the release from Customs custody of any
such textile or textile product shall be deemed conditional during the 180-day period following the date of release.
If the district director finds during the conditional release period that a textile or textile product is not entitled
to admission into the commerce of the United States because the country of origin of the textile or textile product
was not accurately represented to Customs, he shall promptly demand its return to Customs custody. Notwithstanding
the provisions of paragraph (h) of this section and &sect;113.62(k)(1) of this chapter, a failure to comply with a
demand for return to Customs custody made under this paragraph shall result in the assessment of liquidated damages
equal to the value of the merchandise involved.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document corrects several minor technical errors contained in the preamble and text of a final rule on Appraisals
and Property Valuation, that was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on October 3, 1994 (59 FR 50456). Section 267.1(a) is also being corrected to clarify the limited applicability of
part 267 to the risk-sharing program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the final rule, in &sect;267.1(a), limited part 267 to National Housing Act mortgage insurance programs,
it was the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department's intention that the multifamily risk-sharing program under part 266 (which is not a National Housing
Program) would also be covered by provisions in &sect;267.3(c) regarding a reporting requirement for the gender
and minority classification for appraisers. This is made clear in references to the risk-sharing program that appear
in &sect;267.3(c). Section 267.1(a) is being corrected to clarify this limited applicability of part 267 to the risk-sharing
program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, FR Doc. 94&hyph;24327, a final rule on Appraisals and Property Valuation, published in the

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule promulgates national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for halogenated solvent cleaners.
These standards implement section 112 of the Clean Air Act (Act) and are based on the Administrator's determination
that halogenated solvent cleaning machines emit halogenated organic chemicals identified in the Act list of 189
hazardous air pollutants (HAP). The halogenated solvent cleaner NESHAP requires batch vapor solvent cleaning machines
and in-line solvent cleaning machines to meet emission standards reflecting the application of the maximum achievable
control technology for major and area sources; area source batch cold cleaning machines are required to achieve generally
available control technology. The rule regulates the emissions of the following halogenated HAP solvents: methylene
chloride (MC), perchloroethylene (PCE), trichloroethylene (TCE), 1,1,1-trichloroethane (TCA), carbon tetrachloride
(CT), and chloroform (C). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA is also finalizing Method 307 with the standard. This method can be used to demonstrate compliance with the
idling standard.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 National emission standards for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) for halogenated solvent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleaners were proposed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
29, 1993 (58 FR 62566). This 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
announces the EPA's final decisions on the rule. Under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 307(b)(1) of the Act, judicial review of the NESHAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is available only by the filing of a petition for review in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Circuit within 60 days of today's publication of this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 307(b)(2) of the Act, the requirements that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are the subject of today's notice may not be challenged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
later in civil or criminal proceedings brought by the EPA to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

I. The Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
National emission standards for major sources of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazardous air pollutants established under section 112 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act reflect:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
``*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;the maximum degree of reduction in emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the HAP&blank;*&blank;*&blank;* that the Administrator, taking into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration the cost of achieving such emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental impacts and energy requirements, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine is achievable for new or existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources in the category or subcategory to which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such emission standards applies *&blank;*&blank;*'' (the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 112(d)(2)).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Area sources are regulated with a MACT standard, unless 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there is justification for regulating them under GACT. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The promulgated standard includes multiple alternatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to allow owners or operators maximum compliance flexibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These alternatives include an equipment standard, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conjunction with work practice requirements, and an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative overall solvent emissions standard. The idling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission limit and the alternative overall solvent emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard are not available to owners or operators of batch 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cold cleaning machines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If an owner or operator of a batch vapor or in-line 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleaning machine elects to comply with the equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard, they must install one of the control combinations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listed in the regulation, use an automated parts handling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system to process all parts, and follow multiple work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practices. As an alternative to selecting one of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment control combinations listed in the regulation, an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owner or operator may demonstrate that the batch vapor or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in-line cleaning machine can meet the idling mode emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit specified in the standards. In addition to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintaining this idling mode emission limit, the owner or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator of a batch vapor or in-line solvent cleaning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
machine must use an automated parts handling system to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process all parts and comply with the work practice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards. A third alternative for complying with these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards is to comply with the overall solvent emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit. An owner or operator complying with the overall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solvent emissions limit is required to ensure that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions from each solvent cleaning machine are less than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or equal to the solvent emission levels specified in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard. Under this alternative standard, an owner or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator is not required to use an automated parts handling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system or to comply with the work practice standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The batch cold cleaning machine standard is an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment standard. However, those owners or operators 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
choosing the equipment options without the water layer must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also comply with work practice requirements. There is no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
idling standard or overall solvent emissions standard for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
batch cold cleaning machines. Batch cold cleaning machines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
located at nonmajor sources are exempt from title V permit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 114(a)(3) of the amended CAA requires enhanced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring and compliance certification of all major 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stationary sources. The annual compliance certifications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certify whether compliance has been continuous or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intermittent. Enhanced monitoring shall be capable of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detecting deviations from each applicable emission limit or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard with sufficient representativeness, accuracy, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
precision, reliability, frequency and timeliness to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine if compliance is continuous during a reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period. The monitoring in this regulation satisfies the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of enhanced monitoring.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These standards will reduce nationwide emissions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazardous air pollutants (HAP) from halogenated solvent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleaning machines by 77,400 Mg/yr (85,300 tons per year), or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
63 percent by 1997 compared to the emissions that would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result in the absence of the standards. No adverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
secondary air impacts, water or solid waste impacts are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anticipated from the promulgation of these standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The national annual energy usage due to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installation of the required control devices is expected to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase from 12.9 million KWH/yr to 66.9 million KWH/yr, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which is equivalent to approximately 29.3 thousand barrels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of oil. These estimates do not include energy savings from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduced solvent use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The implementation of this regulation is expected to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result in an overall annual national net savings of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$19 million. This includes a net annualized savings from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installation of control devices of $30.5 million and a total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping costs of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$11.6 million. These savings will come from the significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decrease in solvent emissions and, therefore, solvent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumption, which outweigh the overall cost of air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pollution control equipment and monitoring and recordkeeping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs.

The economic impact analysis done at proposal showed that the economic impacts from the proposed standard would be
insignificant. The economic impact analysis has not been revised for promulgation because the changes in costs are
not expected to have any effect on the results of the analysis. While the estimated annual costs for the regulation
have increased since proposal, there are still cost savings for most affected entities. Only entities with small
or medium-sized cleaning machines will not have cost savings, and the costs for the selected regulatory alternatives
for these entities have changed very little since proposal. Since those entities that do not have cost savings were
the only ones analyzed in the proposal, and these costs have changed little, the results from the economic impact analysis
at proposal should still hold for promulgation.

III. Significant Changes to the Proposed Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Public Participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to proposal of the standards, interested parties were advised by public notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (57 FR 46854), of a meeting of the National Air Pollution Control Techniques Advisory Committee to discuss the halogenated
solvent cleaner source recommended for proposal. This meeting was held on November 17 and 18, 1992. The meeting was
open to the public and each attendee was given an opportunity to comment on the standards recommended for proposal.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The standards were proposed and published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 29, 1993 (58 FR 62566). The preamble to the proposed standards discussed the availability of the BID, which
described the regulatory alternatives considered and the impacts of those alternatives. Public comments were solicited
at the time of proposal, and copies of the BID were distributed to interested parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To provide interested persons the opportunity for oral presentation of data, views, or arguments concerning the
proposed standards, a public hearing was offered at proposal; however, one was not requested. The public comment
period was from November 29, 1993 to January 28, 1994. Fifty-seven comment letters were received. The comments have
been carefully considered, and changes have been made in the proposed standards when determined by the Administrator
to be appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Comments on the Proposed Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments on the proposed standards were received from 57 commenters composed mainly of States, solvent cleaning
machine users, solvent cleaning machine vendors, industry and industry trade associations. A detailed discussion
of these comments and responses can be found in the promulgation BID, which is referenced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 section of this preamble. The summary of comments and response in the BID serve as the basis for the revisions that have
been made to the standards between proposal and promulgation. Most of the comment letters contained multiple comments.
The comments have been divided into the following areas: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

C. Significant Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several changes have been made since the proposal of these standards. The majority of the changes have been made to
clarify portions of the rule that were unclear to the commenters. Other changes include adding additional control
combinations and an equation that allows cleaning machines that do not have a solvent vapor/air interface area to
comply with the standard by meeting a solvent emission limit based on cleaning capacity. A summary of the major changes
is presented below.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Several comments were made about the complexity of the rule, with many commenters offering suggested changes
to clarify different sections. Many of these recommendations have been incorporated into the final rule. For example,
the standards for batch cold cleaning machines have been moved to a separate section, the operator test has been included
as appendix B, and a table summarizing the applicability of the General Provisions to this rule has been included in
appendix C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The applicability section of the rule has been clarified to ensure that the standard regulates only those solvents
originally intended for inclusion; namely, MC, PCE, TCE, TCA, CT, and C. Several commenters were concerned that,
as proposed, the rule could be interpreted to regulate non-halogenated solvents contaminated by trace amounts of
halogenated solvent. The EPA never intended for these solvents to be included in these standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) An equation and table have been added to allow solvent cleaning machines that do not have a solvent vapor/air interface
area to comply with these standards. Several new cleaning machines are currently being developed by industry that
cannot install the equipment control devices included in this final rule, do not have an idling mode, and do not have
a solvent vapor/air interface area to relate to the solvent emission limit. The equation and table in the rule allow
owners or operators of halogenated solvent cleaning machines without a solvent vapor/air interface area to comply
with the standard by meeting an overall solvent emissions limit based on cleaning capacity that is equivalent to the
overall solvent emissions limit for machines with a solvent vapor/air interface. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The list of equipment combinations has been modified to remove overlapping controls and to add carbon adsorbers
to the control combinations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are multiple control combinations available for meeting the rule, many of which are pollution prevention measures.
Many of these options also reduce worker exposure. However, some sources may rely on lip exhausts instead in order
to meet OSHA requirements. Use of a lip exhaust without any controls, while reducing worker exposure on the one hand,
would dramatically increase the overall emissions to air. Thus, if lip exhausts are used on solvent cleaning machines,
the rule requires carbon adsorption controls (which have been added explicitly as a control option in the final rule).
Although the lip exhaust-carbon adsorption combination reduces worker exposure and overall emissions to air, it
may impose additional cost and burden on sources as well as on the environment for a number of reasons. First, carbon
adsorption units are generally more expensive than other controls listed in the options. Second, these units may
present cross-media impacts such as effluent discharges if not properly operated and maintained, and spent carbon
beds that have to be disposed of as hazardous waste. Thus, when making decisions about what controls to install on halogenated
solvent cleaning machines to meet the requirements of this rule, all of these factors should be weighed and pollution
prevention measures are encouraged wherever possible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA acknowledges that data show little additional benefit is achieved by the use of a working-mode cover in the
presence of reduced room draft. Therefore, these controls are no longer included in the same control combination.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Some changes have also been made to the compliance and reporting schedules. The initial notification report deadline
for existing sources has been extended from 90 to 270 days after promulgation. This overrides the 120 day deadline
in the final part 63 General Provisions. This was done to allow more time for the delegation of this rule to the States
and to allow more time to process the reports from the large number of facilities affected by this rule. The initial
statement of compliance report deadline for new and existing sources has been extended from 30 days to 150 days after
the compliance date to allow time for owners or operators to determine compliance with the 3-month rolling average
emission limit. The compliance time for existing sources has been extended from 2 to 3 years. This extension has been
provided to allow sources the maximum flexibility in complying with these standards, including allowing time to
consider alternative cleaning technologies. This change is consistent with the General Provisions (&sect;63.6(b)(3)).
The exceedance report schedule has been changed to include a biannual exceedance report if there is not an exceedance.
This change is consistent with the General Provisions (&sect;63.10(e)). Exceedance reports must still be submitted
quarterly if there is an exceedance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(6) Several commenters stated that the rule was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complex and difficult to understand. They stated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional guidance should be provided, particularly for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small businesses. The EPA agrees that guidance would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
helpful and has developed a brochure summarizing the rule, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and will be developing a guidance manual that is scheduled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for publication in January 1995. This guidance manual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
includes a detailed summary of the rule, example forms that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be used for reporting and recordkeeping, and additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance for evaluating alternative cleaning technologies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Several commenters recommended that the EPA reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the monitoring frequency of the emission control equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA evaluated the monitoring frequencies and has added a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision to the final rule that allows the hoist monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequency to decrease from monthly to quarterly if, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owner or operator has operated the hoist for one year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without an exceedance in the hoist speed. The EPA has also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changed the reduced room draft (RRD) monitoring frequency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from weekly to quarterly with weekly monitoring of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters used to obtain the RRD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Several comments were received on the batch cold 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleaning machine equipment requirement provisions. A number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of commenters reported the use of TCA, MC, and TCE in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncarburetor batch cold cleaning machine operations. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters stated that the proposed water layer control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
option was not always possible for these cleaning machines, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particularly when TCA or TCE solvents are used. In order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
address this issue, alternative control equipment options 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were added to the final rule to allow for the use of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased freeboard ratio and cover, or remote-reservoir and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cover, in lieu of a water layer and cover. An owner or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator complying with these alternative options must also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comply with work practice requirements. The final rule also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allows an owner or operator of a batch cold cleaning machine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to use alternative control equipment, if demonstrated to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent to the equipment requirements cited in the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule and approved by the Administrator.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Docket 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The docket is an organized and complete file of all the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information considered by the EPA in the development of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking. The docket is a dynamic file, since material is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
added throughout the rulemaking development. The docketing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system is intended to allow members of the public and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industries involved to readily identify and locate documents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
so that they can effectively participate in the rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process. Along with the statement of basis and purpose of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed and promulgated standards and the EPA responses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to significant comments, the contents of the docket will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
serve as the record in case of judicial review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(section 307(d)(7)(A)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Paperwork Reduction Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Information collection requirements associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this regulation (those included in 40 CFR Part 63, Subpart A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Subpart T) have been approved by the Office of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been assigned OMB control number (2060&hyph;0273). An 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information Collection Request (ICR) document has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared by the EPA (ICR No. 1652.02) to reflect the changed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information requirements of the final rule and has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted to OMB for review. A copy may be obtained from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sandy Farmer, Information Policy Branch, EPA 2136, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
401 M St., SW, Washington, DC 20460, or by calling (202) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
260&hyph;2740. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The annual respondent burden and costs averaged over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the first 3 years for batch vapor and in-line cleaning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
machine subcategories are 359,000 hours and $12.0 million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the reporting burden for some of the required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities will be incurred only once, the average annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burden for batch vapor and in-line cleaning machine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subcategories will decrease after the first two years of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation. For the batch cold cleaning machine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subcategory, the annual respondent burden and costs averaged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over the first 3 years are 33,000 hours and $1.1 million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The batch cold cleaning machine subcategory is not expected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to incur costs after the initial activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This collection of information is estimated to have an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annual public reporting and recordkeeping burden averaging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
42 hours per facility over the first 3 years. These burden 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimates include time for reviewing instructions, searching 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters to the proposed rule in recognizing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this burden noted that the rule was complex and difficult to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
understand, and suggested that additional guidance be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided, particularly for small businesses. To address 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these concerns the Emission Standards Division and the Small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Business Assistance Program are developing a brochure to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
summarize this rule, and will be developing a guidance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manual scheduled to be published in January 1995. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manual will include a detailed summary of the rule, example 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forms for reporting and recordkeeping, to alleviate at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in part the paperwork burden, and additional material for

C. Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993)) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likely to result in a rule that may: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
million or more or adversely affect in a material way the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
local or tribal governments or communities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principles set forth in the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, OMB has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notified EPA that it considers this a ``significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory action'' within the meaning of the Executive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Order. The EPA has submitted this action to OMB for review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changes made in response to OMB suggestions or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

D. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (or RFA, Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, September 19, 1980) requires Federal agencies to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
give special consideration to the impact of regulation on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small businesses. The RFA specifies that a final regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flexibility analysis must be prepared if a proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation will have a significant economic impact on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial number of small entities. To determine whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a final RFA is required, a screening analysis, otherwise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
known as an initial RFA, is necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory impacts are considered significant if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Annual compliance costs increase total costs of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production by more than 5 percent; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Annual compliance costs as a percent of sales are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at least 20 percent (percentage points) higher for small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Capital cost of compliance represents a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant portion of capital available to small entities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The requirements of the regulation are likely to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result in closures of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A ``substantial number'' of small entities is generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered to be more than 20 percent of the small entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the affected industry. Since the economic analysis deals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only with small entities (in this case, facilities), it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also an initial RFA, and conclusions about the impacts on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small entities can be drawn from what was done there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
already. Each of the criteria for significant impacts will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be considered in turn. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The largest increase in total cost of production from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased emission control is 0.61 percent (SIC 359_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industrial Machinery, n.e.c.). This figure is well below 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the significant-impact threshold of five percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessing the differential impacts, measured by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comparison of compliance costs as a percent of sales for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small and large entities, is more difficult as large model 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities were not analyzed in the economic impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis. Treatment of this small business impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criterion involves creating two large model facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is assumed that large facilities use large solvent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleaning machines, then compliance costs for large cleaning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
machines are negative, and are thus savings. To be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conservative, it is assumed here that large model facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possess five very large solvent cleaning machines, so that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``maximum savings'' case is modelled. This case is important 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as it models the maximum cost differential between large and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Large model facilities were created for SICs 359 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Industrial Machinery, n.e.c.) and 254 (Partitions and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fixtures). SIC 359 was chosen because the small model 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities in this group experience the highest cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
absorption impacts when compared with other small model 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities. SIC 254 was used because it had the smallest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average per-facility revenue of facilities with greater than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
100 employees. Thus, if they incur the same absolute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
savings as other large facilities, their relative percentage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
savings will be the highest, and they will experience the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greatest cost savings in percentage terms as a result of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard. The cost differentials are in no case larger than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one percentage point. Thus, by this criterion, small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business impacts are not deemed significant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third criterion focuses on the amount of capital 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available to small businesses or facilities. Since the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capital costs incurred as a result of investment in control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment needed for small businesses to meet the standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was less than 10 percent of the businesses' total assets in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all 39 affected SIC codes, it was concluded that the total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assets of small facilities will not be so adversely affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as to prohibit the procurement of outside financing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Examining an increase in capital costs as a percentage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
total assets is a measure of the ability of a firm or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility to meet this capital costs increase.) The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conclusion, then, is that lack of available capital will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be an obstacle for small facilities in complying with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Criterion number four stipulates that small business 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacts are significant if compliance leads to closure. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only implication of closure in the economic impact analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is found in the section on earnings impacts. Here it was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found that, under worst-case assumptions, closures might 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occur in only two SIC codes, 254 and 259 (Miscellaneous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furniture and Fixtures), given their low rate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
profitability in the baseline. If this indeed occurs, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
question of whether or not these closures make up a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial portion of small entities must be addressed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The actual number of impacted facilities in the 39 impacted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SICs is unknown. If it can be assumed that each SIC is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacted in the same proportion, a proxy for the share of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacted facilities represented by SIC codes 254 and 259 is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the total number of facilities in these SIC codes as a share 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the total number of potentially impacted firms. SIC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
codes 254 and 259 hold a combined total 3,194 small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities. This makes up 3.4 percent of the total 93,121 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small facilities in all 39 SIC codes. Thus, in the extreme 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
case that some closures result, the number of closures is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimated to be far less than the amount required to impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a substantial number of facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In conclusion, and pursuant to section 605(b) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator certifies that this rule will not have a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities. The basis for the certification is that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic impacts for small entities do not meet or exceed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the four criteria in the Guidelines to the Regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Flexibility Act of 1980, as shown above. Further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Superheated vapor system 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
means a system that heats the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solvent vapor, either passively or actively, to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature above the solvent's boiling point. Parts are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
held in the superheated vapor before exiting the machine to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaporate the liquid solvent on them. Hot vapor recycle is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an example of a superheated vapor system.

Unlike most of the control techniques available for complying with this rule, carbon adsorbers are not considered
to be a pollution prevention measure. Use of such units may impose additional cost and burden for a number of reasons.
First, carbon adsorption units are generally more expensive than other controls listed in the options. Second, these
units may present cross-media impacts such as effluent discharges if not properly operated and maintained, and spent
carbon beds have to be disposed of as hazardous waste. When making decisions about what controls to install on halogenated
solvent cleaning machines to meet the requirements of this rule, all of these factors should be weighed and pollution
prevention measures are encouraged wherever possible.

Title V of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (sections 501&hyph;507 of the Clean Air Act (``the Act'')), and implementing
regulations at 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 70, require that States develop and submit operating permits
programs to EPA by November 15, 1993, and that EPA act to approve or disapprove each program within one year after receiving
the submittal. EPA's program review occurs pursuant to Section 502 of the Act and the part 70 regulations, which together
outline criteria for approval or disapproval. Where a program substantially, but not fully, meets the requirements
of part 70, EPA may grant the program interim approval for a period of up to two years. If EPA has not fully approved a program
by two years after the November 15, 1993 date, or by the end of an interim program, it must establish and implement a Federal
program.

On September 14, 1994, EPA proposed interim approval of the operating permits programs for ODEQ and LRAPA, provided
certain proposed revisions to Oregon rules were adopted and submitted to EPA as a program revision prior to EPA's statutory
deadline for acting on the State's submittal. In the alternative, EPA proposed disapproval of the Oregon program
if the proposed revisions were not adopted and submitted prior to the statutory deadline. See 59 FR 47105 (Sept. 14,
1994). EPA received four public comments on the proposal. In this notice EPA is taking final action on its proposal
to promulgate interim approval of the operating permits programs for ODEQ and LRAPA.

340, Division 28 on October 21, 1994. These rules became effective on October 28, 1994. Oregon submitted these revised
regulations to EPA on November 15, 1994 as an amendment to the Oregon title V submittal. The revisions make the regulatory
changes necessary for the Oregon program to receive interim approval.

EPA received comments on the EPA's proposed action on the Oregon program from four commenters: ODEQ, the American
Forest &amp; Paper Association, the National Environmental Development Association/Clean Air Regulatory Project,
and the Northwest Pulp and Paper Association. No commenters objected to approval of the Oregon permit program.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Insignificant Emissions Units.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter objected to EPA's proposal that in order to avoid disapproval of its title V program, Oregon must revise
its regulation defining ``categorically insignificant activities'' (OAR 340&hyph;28&hyph;110(15)) and the
related provisions on permit applications (OAR 340&hyph;28&hyph;2120(3)) and applicability (OAR 340&hyph;28&hyph;2110(7)).
The commenter disagreed with EPA's position that all activities subject to applicable requirements must be properly
incorporated into title V permits. The commenter further stated that the Clean Air Act does not support EPA's position
and that EPA's interpretation renders the Part 70 provisions on insignificant activities meaningless. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA maintains, however, that title V and the part 70 rules preclude the exemption of activities as ``insignificant''
when such units are subject to an applicable requirement. Section 504(a) of the Act provides that ``each permit issued
under this title shall include enforceable emission limitations and standards, a schedule of compliance, a requirement
that the permittee submit to the permitting authority, no less often than every 6 months, the results of any required
monitoring, and such other conditions as are necessary to assure compliance with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
applicable requirements of the Act, including the requirements of the applicable implementation plan.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' (emphasis added). Section 70.6(a)(1) provides that each permit shall include ``emission limitations and standards,
including those operational requirements and limitations that assure compliance with all applicable requirements
at the time of permit issuance''. Furthermore, 70.6(c)(1) requires that each permit shall contain ``compliance,
certification, testing, monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements sufficient to assure compliance
with the terms and conditions of the permit.'' The fact that an emission unit may emit only small quantities of pollutants
does not provide a basis to exempt it from the fundamental statutory requirement that title V permits must specifically
include, and ensure compliance with, all applicable requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA disagrees that requiring all activities subject to applicable requirements to be properly incorporated into
title V permits will render the insignificant activities provisions of Part 70 meaningless. For example, the requirement
to ``describe'' emissions of regulated pollutants in a permit application is not a requirement to quantify those
emissions. Smaller units can be aggregated and described in very general terms (i.e., ``all valves and flanges not
otherwise specified'') provided the description is specific enough to determine the applicability of and to impose
all applicable requirements. Furthermore, the requirement to include in a permit compliance certification testing,
monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
sufficient to assure compliance
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 with the terms and conditions of the permit does not impose the same level of rigor with respect to small emission units
that do not require extensive testing or monitoring in order to determine compliance with the applicable requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In any event, Oregon has made the changes to its insignificant activities regulations which EPA indicated in the September
14, 1994, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice were necessary for approval and it is these revised regulations on which EPA is taking final action at this time.
The versions of OAR 340&hyph;28&hyph;110(15), 340&hyph;28&hyph;2110(7) and 340&hyph;28&hyph;2120(3) originally
submitted by Oregon to EPA on November 15, 1993, as part of its title V submittal are no longer effective as a matter of
State law and are no longer before EPA for consideration. Accordingly, EPA is fully approving the Oregon program with
respect to insignificant activities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b. Definition of Title I Modification.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The definition of ``title I modification'' in the regulations submitted by Oregon as part of its Title V program does
not include changes reviewed under a minor source preconstruction review program approved pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(C)
of the Act (``minor NSR changes'') or changes triggering the application of a National Emission Standard for Hazardous
Air Pollutants (NESHAP) established pursuant to section 112 prior to the 1990 Amendments (``part 61 NESHAP modifications'').
In the September 14, 1994 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice proposing action on the Oregon title V program, EPA advised the State that it would be required to revise its
definition of the term ``title I modification'' to obtain full EPA approval:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Therefore, EPA proposes that, to receive full approval, Oregon must revise OAR 340&hyph;28&hyph;110(118) to include
any determination established through a minor source pre-construction permit as well as changes reviewed under
40 CFR 61.15. EPA expects to revise its criteria for interim approval in 40 CFR 70.4(d) prior to final action on this
proposal to grant interim approval to Oregon so that interim approval may be granted to State programs like Oregon's
that include a narrower definition of ``title I modification.'' As noted, EPA believes the better interpretation
of ``title I modifications'' would preclude granting full approval to the Oregon program. However, in the proposal
to revise Part 70, EPA will be taking comment on whether the criteria in 40 CFR 70.7(e)(2)(i)(A), including the phrase
``modification under any provision of title I,'' should be interpreted in a manner that would allow changes reviewed
under programs approved pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(C) of the Act and changes that trigger the application of NESHAP
established prior to the 1990 Amendments to be eligible for processing through minor modification procedures. Should
EPA adopt this alternative interpretation, the current definition of ``title I modification'' in the Oregon programs
would be fully consistent with Part 70. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 47108).

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to EPA's proposed interim approval of the Oregon program, three commenters objected to EPA's proposed
requirement that Oregon revise its definition of ``title I modification'' to include minor new source review in order
to obtain full approval. These commenters argued that Oregon's current definition fully meets the requirements
of the Clean Air Act. One commenter contended that section 110(a)(2) does not require a State Implementation Plan
(SIP) to include a program to regulate the modification of any stationary source but rather to only include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a program to regulate modifications as defined in other sections of title I. These commenters also stated that the
changes required by the September 14, 1994, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice would be completely unworkable and would frustrate the practical implementation of the operating permit
program in Oregon by requiring sources to undergo significant permit modification procedures for changes covered
by Oregon's Notice of Construction rule that was approved by EPA as part of the SIP under section 110(a)(2)(C) of the
Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed below, EPA has reconsidered the approach proposed in the September 14, 1994 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice and is fully approving Oregon's title V program with respect to the definition of ``title I modification.''
If EPA were to conclude at this time that the phrase ``title I modification'' should be interpreted as including minor
NSR changes, EPA would be required to disapprove Oregon's program because part 70 does not currently allow EPA to grant
interim approval unless the permitting agency has adequate authority to issue permits that assure compliance with
all applicable requirements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 40 CFR 70.4(d)(3)(ii). On August 29, 1994, EPA proposed revisions to the interim approval criteria to, among other
things, allow State programs with a more narrow definition of ``title I modification,'' like Oregon's, to receive
interim approval (59 FR 44572). The Agency also solicited public comment on the appropriate interpretation of ``title
I modification'' (59 FR 44573). The Agency stated that if, after considering the public comments, it continued to
believe that the phrase ``title I modification'' should be interpreted as including minor NSR changes, it would revise
the interim approval criteria as needed to grant interim approval to States that adopted a narrower definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted in the September 14, 1994 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice proposing action on Oregon's title V program, EPA intended to finalize its revisions to the interim approval
criteria under 40 CFR section 70.4(d) before taking final action on Part 70 programs submitted by the States. However,
that is no longer possible. Publication of the proposed revisions occurred on August 29, 1994, and EPA received several
requests to extend the original 30-day public comment period. Given the importance to the States, sources and the
public of the issues raised in that rulemaking, but mindful of the need to take action quickly, EPA agreed to extend
the comment period until October 28, 1994. See 59 FR 52122 (October 14, 1994). Consequently, final action to revise
the interim approval criteria will not occur before the deadline for EPA action on State programs, such as Oregon's,
that were submitted on or before November 15, 1993.

EPA believes it would be inappropriate to delay action on Oregon's program, perhaps for several months, until final
action is taken on the interim approval revisions. EPA also believes it would be inappropriate to grant interim approval
to Oregon on this issue before final action is taken to revise the current interim approval criteria of 40 CFR &sect;70.4(b)
to provide a legal basis for such approval. Until the revision to the interim approval criteria is promulgated, EPA's
choices are to either fully approve or to disapprove the narrower definition of ``title I modification'' in States
such as Oregon. For the reasons set forth below, EPA believes that disapproving such programs at this time solely because
of this issue would be inappropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, EPA has not yet conclusively determined that a narrower definition of ``title I modification'' is inappropriate
and thus a bar to full approval. The Agency has received numerous comments on this issue as a result of the August 29,
1994 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice, and EPA obviously cannot make a final decision on this issue until it has evaluated all of the comments. As such,
EPA will address the concerns regarding its interpretation of ``title I modification'' which were raised by the commenters
on EPA's proposed interim approval of the Oregon program within the context of the final rulemaking for revisions
to part 70. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, EPA believes that the Oregon program should not be disapproved because EPA itself has not yet completed rulemaking
to resolve this issue. Moreover, disapproving programs from States such as Oregon that submitted their program to
EPA on or before the November 15, 1993 statutory deadline could lead to the inequitable result that these States would
receive disapprovals, while States which were late in submitting programs could take advantage of revised interim
approval criteria if and when these criteria become final. In effect, States would be severely penalized for having
made timely program submissions to EPA. Finally, disapproval of a State program for a potential problem that primarily
affects permit revision procedures would delay the initial issuance of Part 70 permits, hampering State and Federal
efforts to improve environmental protection through the operating permits programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, for the reasons described above, EPA is approving Oregon's use of a narrower definition of ``title I modification''
at this time.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 However, should EPA in the interim approval criteria rulemaking make a final determination that such a narrow definition
of ``title I modification'' is inappropriate and that a revision of the interim approval criteria is warranted, the
Agency will propose further action on Oregon's program so that the State's definition of ``title I modification''
would become grounds for interim approval.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A State program like Oregon's that receives full approval of its narrower ``title I modification'' definition pending
completion of EPA's rulemaking must ultimately be placed on an equal footing with States that receive interim approval
in later months under any revised interim approval criteria because of the same issue. Converting the full approval
on this issue to an interim approval after EPA completes its rulemaking will avoid this inequity. EPA anticipates
that an action to convert the full approval on the ``title I modification'' issue to an interim approval would be done
through an additional rulemaking to ensure that there is adequate notice of the change in approval status of Oregon's
title V program.

c. Section 112(g) Modifications.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two commenters stated that, because EPA has not yet issued final regulations to implement section 112(g) of the Act
and no such final regulations are expected for several months, it was inappropriate for EPA to require Oregon to take
delegation of section 112(g) authority as a condition of title V approval. These commenters also objected to EPA's
transitional policy of allowing permitting authorities to use their existing State air toxics permitting rules,
upon EPA approval, as an interim mechanism for implementing section 112(g) of the Act.

EPA disagrees with the commenters' contention that it is inappropriate for EPA to require Oregon to implement section
112(g) until after EPA has promulgated implementing regulations. The statutory language in section 112(g)(2) prohibits
the modification, construction, or reconstruction of a source after the effective date of a title V program unless
maximum achievable control technology (MACT) (determined on a case-by-case basis, if necessary) is met. The unambiguous
meaning of this provision is that the prohibition takes effect in a State on the effective date of title V in that State
regardless of whether EPA or the State has promulgated implementing regulations. Furthermore, implementation
of section 112(g) by a permitting authority is a requirement for receiving approval of its title V program (See 56 FR
21722 (May 10, 1991) and the April 13, 1993 memorandum entitled, ``Title V Program Approval Criteria for Section 112
Activities,'' signed by John Seitz, Director of the Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards). EPA's approval
of Oregon's title V program is based upon Oregon's commitment to implement section 112(g) upon the effective date
of its title V program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has acknowledged that States may encounter difficulties implementing section 112(g) prior to promulgation
of final EPA regulations (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
June 28, 1994 memorandum entitled, ``Guidance for Initial Implementation of Section 112(g),'' signed by John Seitz,
Director of the Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards). EPA has issued guidance, in the form of the proposed
regulations implementing Section 112(g), which may be used to determine whether a physical or operational change
at a source is not a modification either because it is below 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
levels or because it has been offset by a decrease of more hazardous emissions. See 59 FR 15004 (April 1, 1994). EPA believes
the proposed rule provides sufficient guidance to Oregon and sources until such time as EPA's section 112(g) rulemaking
is finalized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is aware that Oregon does not have a program designed specifically to implement section 112(g); however, Oregon
does have several preconstruction review programs that can serve as procedural vehicles for rendering Federally
enforceable case-by-case MACT or offset determinations. Oregon's preconstruction review programs may be used
during the transition period between title V approval in Oregon and EPA approval of Oregon regulations to implement
Section 112(g) to grant relief from the prohibition imposed by section 112(g). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes Oregon's preconstruction review programs will be adequate in most, if not all, cases because they will
allow Oregon to select control measures that would meet MACT, as defined in section 112, and incorporate these measures
into a Federally-enforceable preconstruction permit. Although it is true that the preconstruction review programs
in the EPA-approved Oregon state implementation plan (SIP) apply only to criteria pollutants, Oregon should be able
to impose Federally-enforceable measures reflecting MACT for most, if not all, changes qualifying as a modification,
construction, or reconstruction under section 112(g). EPA believes this to be the case because most section 112(b)
hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) are also criteria pollutants, and moreover because measures designed to limit criteria
pollutant emissions will often have the incidental effect of limiting non-criteria pollutant HAPs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In those instances where a section 112(g) modification, construction, or reconstruction is entirely outside of
Oregon's SIP preconstruction review programs, for example, where the change results only in non-criteria pollutant
HAP emissions, sources may be able to utilize either one of two new provisions of Oregon's rules which have been submitted
to EPA for approval under section 112(l) of the Act. Upon EPA approval of these rules, sources would be able to utilize
Oregon's provision for voluntary HAP plant-site emission limits (see OAR 340&hyph;28&hyph;1050(2)(b)) or permits
to construct or modify major sources of HAPs (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OAR 340&hyph;32&hyph;500 and 4500) to make case-by-case MACT or offset determinations Federally enforceable.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another consequence of the fact that Oregon lacks an EPA-approved program designed specifically to implement section
112(g) is that the applicability criteria found in its approved preconstruction review programs may differ from
those in section 112(g). However, whether a particular source change qualifies as a modification, construction,
or reconstruction for section 112(g) purposes will be determined according to the statutory provisions of section
112(g), using the proposed rule as guidance. As noted in the June 28, 1994 guidance, EPA intends to defer wherever possible
to a State's judgement regarding applicability determinations. This deference must be subject to obvious limitations.
For instance, a physical or operational change resulting in a net increase in HAP emissions above 10 tons per year could
not be viewed as a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
increase under any interpretation of the Act. The EPA would expect Oregon to be able to issue a preconstruction permit
containing a case-by-case determination of MACT in such a case even if review under its own preconstruction review
programs would not be triggered.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
d. Limitations on Potential to Emit
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Two commenters objected to EPA's requirement that Oregon refrain from adopting proposed revisions to Oregon's
applicability provision (OAR 340&hyph;28&hyph;2110) on the grounds that such a revision would inappropriately
exempt certain title V sources from the requirements of title V. In the September 14, 1994, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice, EPA stated that the applicability provision originally submitted by Oregon on November 15, 1993, was fully
approvable. EPA also stated, however, that it believed that Oregon's proposed revision to OAR 340&hyph;28&hyph;2110,
which would exempt from title V sources subject to certain ``prohibitory rules'' Oregon had also proposed, would
require disapproval of Oregon's program. The commenters stated, without elaboration, that Oregon's proposed revisions
to OAR 340&hyph;28&hyph;2110 are fully consistent with 40 CFR 70.3(b)(1), which allows States to exempt temporarily
from title V certain categories of sources that are not major sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA maintains that the exemptions Oregon proposed in OAR 340&hyph;28&hyph;2110(4) exceeded the scope of the exemption
allowed under part 70 because the revisions would exempt four categories of sources from the requirements of title
V as a matter of State law even if EPA does not approve the ``prohibitory rules'' into the SIP so as to make them Federally
enforceable. In other words, Oregon's proposed revision to OAR 340&hyph;28&hyph;2110(4) would have impermissibly
exempted title V sources that were in fact major sources under Federal law if the ``prohibitory rule'' under which
the sources sought to operate were not approved by EPA. In addition, the proposed revision would have exempted sources
within the four categories from title V even if such sources were subject to standards promulgated pursuant to section
111 or 112 of the Act after July 21, 1992, and the sources had been specifically determined in such promulgation not
to be exempt from title V (see 40 CFR 70.3(b)(2)). More to the point, if EPA approves a ``prohibitory rule'' into the
Oregon SIP which has the effect of making sources subject to that rule ``minor sources,'' then those sources would
be exempted from title V by the current provision in OAR 340&hyph;28&hyph;2110(4)(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In any event, Oregon did not adopt the proposed revision to OAR 340&hyph;28&hyph;2110(4). Therefore, the version
of the regulation which the commenters addressed in their comments is no longer before EPA for consideration. Rather,
it is the version of OAR 340&hyph;28&hyph;2110(4) which Oregon originally submitted to EPA on November 15, 1993,
and which EPA proposed to approve on September 14, 1994, that is currently before EPA. Accordingly, OAR 340&hyph;28&hyph;2110
does not present a bar to title V approval.

e. Environmental Audit Privilege
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. One commenter raised several objections to EPA's discussion in the September 14, 1994 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice of Oregon's environmental audit privilege (ORS 468.963). EPA there stated that it was currently developing
a national position regarding EPA approval of environmental programs in States which have environmental audit privileges
and that it was proposing to take no action on the Oregon audit provision in the context of this title V approval. EPA
further stated that it might consider such a provision grounds for withdrawing program approval under 40 CFR 70.10(c)
in the future if it later determined that the Oregon audit provision interfered with Oregon's enforcement responsibilities
under part 70. See 59 FR 47106. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although acknowledging that EPA is taking no current action on the Oregon audit provision, the commenter stated that
it is bad policy for EPA to threaten a State permit program by indicating that EPA's own policy is under review, and that
the Oregon law is fully consistent with the Clean Air Act and Federal law on criminal enforcement. The commenter further
stated that civil penalties, which the commenter believes are not precluded by the Oregon audit provision, are adequate
to deter noncompliance and that the Oregon provision does not impinge on EPA's enforcement authorities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA's discussion of the environmental audit privilege was not intended to be taken as a threat to the approval of Oregon's
title V program; rather, EPA merely intends to advise Oregon that the audit provision could be grounds for withdrawing
Oregon's title V program in the future if EPA were to determine that the provision interfered with Oregon's enforcement
responsibilities under part 70. Section 70.11(c)(iii) allows EPA to withdraw program approval if it determines
that a State has failed to enforce the requirements of part 70. EPA also disagrees with the premise underlying the commenter's
assessment that the Oregon audit provision is consistent with the Clean Air Act and other Federal criminal law. The
commenter stated that the Oregon audit statute provides a shield only against criminal liability. By its terms, however,
the privilege applies to ``any civil, criminal or administrative proceeding'' except as otherwise provided by the
statute. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ORS 468.963(2). Finally, the commenter's argument that the Oregon statute does not impinge on EPA's enforcement
authorities, if carried to its logical conclusion, would mean that a State would not have to have any civil or criminal
enforcement authorities to obtain title V approval. Such an argument contradicts the clear requirement that States
must have certain civil and criminal enforcement authorities in order to obtain title V approval. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Section 502(b)(5)(E) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In any event, the commenter's concerns are premature at this time. As the commenter acknowledged, EPA has not proposed
to take any action on Oregon's environmental audit privilege in the context of this final action on Oregon's program.
Such concerns would be properly raised when and if EPA proposed to withdraw Oregon's title V approval because EPA determines
that the Oregon statute is interfering with Oregon's ability to enforce its title V program or EPA revised part 70 to
prohibit environmental audit provisions such as Oregon's.

Upset/Bypass. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA received two comments on its proposed finding that ORS 468.959, which provides a specific defense to criminal
liability for violations resulting from an ``upset'' or a ``bypass,'' precludes full title V approval. In its proposal,
EPA stated that the Oregon provision appears broader than the affirmative defense set forth in 40 CFR 70.6(g) for emissions
in excess of technology-based emissions limits. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
59 FR 47108. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated simply that Oregon's statute is consistent with part 70, without further elaboration. The other
commenter argued that the Oregon statute clearly places the burden of proof of establishing an upset or a bypass on
the defendant, as required by 40 CFR 70.6(g)(4). The commenter also stated that the Oregon statute merely sets forth
an affirmative defense based on necessity and that nothing in the Clean Air Act authorizes EPA to preempt such longstanding
notions of fairness that have been incorporated into State criminal law. The commenter further argued that if the
Oregon upset/bypass statute precludes full approval in Oregon, other States with similar statutes should be similarly
treated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA agrees with the commenter that the Oregon statute appears to place the burden of proving an upset or bypass on the
defendant, as required by 40 CFR 70.6(g)(4). EPA nonetheless maintains that the Oregon statute is broader than the
emergency provisions of 40 CFR 70.6(g) for several reasons. Section 70.6(g) requires a source to prove that the excess
emissions were not caused by improperly designed control equipment, lack of preventive maintenance, careless or
improper operation, or operator error. No similar showing is required for a source in Oregon to claim an affirmative
defense to excess emissions due to a ``bypass.'' For example, the Oregon provision would allow a source to routinely
bypass improperly designed control equipment with impunity simply by indicating that the control equipment would
be severely damaged if operated during the periods of bypass. The recordkeeping and reporting requirements under
part 70 are also more extensive than those required by ORS 468.959. Moreover, the emergency provision of part 70 provides
a defense only to emissions in excess of a technology-based emissions limit, while the Oregon statute provides a defense
to any emissions limit, including a health-based limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also disagrees with the commenter's assertion that the Clean Air Act does not authorize EPA to require States to
make changes to their criminal statutes. Title V requires that States have appropriate criminal authorities in order
to obtain title V approval. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 502(b)(5)(E). EPA has interpreted this statutory provision in part 70 section 70.11 and must evaluate State
programs for consistency with the promulgated rule. In response to the commenter's concern that all States should
be treated similarly on this issue, EPA notes the commenter's concern and agrees that evenhanded treatment is appropriate.
In conclusion, EPA continues to believe that ORS 468.959 poses a bar to full approval, but does allow for interim approval.

Corporate criminal liability. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA received three comments concerning EPA's interpretation of ORS 161.170, which addresses the extent to which
a corporation can be subject to criminal liability in Oregon. Based on its initial review of the statute, EPA believed
that, in order for a corporation to be criminally liable for knowing violations of permit terms and other applicable
requirements under ORS 468.936, the State must show that the board of directors or a high managerial agent ``engaged
in, authorized, solicited, requested, commanded or knowingly tolerated'' the conduct giving rise to the violation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ORS 161.170(1)(c). EPA's preliminary view was that the Oregon statute imposed a greater burden of proof and degree
of knowledge or intent than Federal law, which requires only that the crime be committed by an employee of the corporation
and that the employee was at the time performing that employee's duties for the corporation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter responded that EPA's objection to ORS 161.170 was inappropriate because EPA should not interfere with
State criminal law and that EPA already has sufficient authority to bring its own criminal actions. Another commenter
stated, without further elaboration, that the burden of proof for criminal violations in Oregon is the same as for
federal crimes because, in both jurisdictions, the prosecution must prove the existence of a crime beyond a reasonable
doubt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As explained above, EPA disagrees that the Clean Air Act does not authorize EPA to require States to change their criminal
laws to meet the requirements for an approvable title V program and that Federal criminal authority is sufficient
in and of itself. Title V prohibits EPA from approving a State title V program if the State does not have appropriate
criminal authority, so Congress obviously contemplated that States with insufficient criminal authority would
need to amend their statutes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 502(b)(5)(E). Moreover, as discussed above, if Congress thought that Federal criminal enforcement authorities
provided sufficient deterrence, Congress would not have required that States have appropriate criminal authorities
in order to obtain title V approval.

A third comment was submitted by the State, which included an opinion letter from the Oregon Attorney General's office
stating that the Oregon standard under ORS 161.170(1)(a) is equivalent to the Federal standard articulated by EPA
in its September 14, 1994 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice. The Attorney General opined that ORS 161.170(1)(a), like Federal law, adopts the principle of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
respondeat superior
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 with the additional requirement that the employee's conduct occur on behalf of the corporation. In light of the most
recent opinion letter submitted by the Oregon Attorney General's office, EPA concludes that Oregon law does not impose
a different burden of proof or degree of knowledge or intent for corporations than does Federal law. In its September
14, 1994, proposal, EPA had assumed that knowing violations of permits and applicable requirements would fall under
ORS 161.170(1)(c), which requires proof that the employee's conduct was authorized or otherwise condoned by the
board of directors or a high managerial agent. The Attorney General pointed out, however, that ORS 468.936, which
satisfies the general criminal authority required by 40 CFR 70.11(a)(3)(ii), is not defined as a felony under Oregon
law, and is therefore a ``violation.'' Accordingly, a corporation which violated ORS 468.936 could be prosecuted
under ORS 161.170(1)(a), which requires only that the illegal conduct was engaged in by an agent of the corporation
acting within the scope of employment and on behalf of the corporation. As noted by the Attorney General and by EPA in
its September 14, 1994 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice, this is equivalent to the Federal standard. In short, based on the opinion letter of the Attorney General,
EPA has determined that ORS 161.170 does not pose a bar to full approval of Oregon's program.

g. Administrative Amendments. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters disagreed that Oregon's regulation authorizing administrative permit amendments, OAR 340&hyph;28&hyph;2230(1)(j),
would allow the administrative amendment process to be used to change the content of a permit. These commenters asserted
that this regulation would only allow the correction of minor misinterpretations of an applicable requirement,
which they felt was appropriate. EPA objected to OAR 340&hyph;28&hyph;2230(1)(j) because, although the regulation
could be used appropriately as the commenter suggested, the plain language of the rule would also allow the permitting
authority to add or delete an applicable requirement from the title V permit without public participation if it determined
the change was due to a ``minor misinterpretation of an applicable requirement.'' EPA maintains this position. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to EPA's concerns, however, Oregon repealed OAR 340&hyph;28&hyph;2230(1)(j) on October 21, 1994. Thus,
that provision is no longer effective as a matter of State law and is not before EPA for consideration at this time. Rather,
OAR 340&hyph;28&hyph;2230, as amended by Oregon on October 21, 1994, and submitted to EPA on November 15, 1994, is
currently before EPA for consideration and is fully approvable.

h. Variance Provision. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters objected to EPA's discussion of the Oregon variance provisions, ORS 468A.075 and LRAPA Title 23, section
23&hyph;005. In the September 14, 1994, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice, EPA proposed to take no action on these variance provisions because EPA believed they were external to Oregon's
title V program. EPA also stated, however, that a variance granted by a permitting authority cannot modify a source's
obligations under a title V permit, even if the State variance provision or the source-specific variance itself has
been approved into the State SIP, unless the variance is incorporated into the permit through appropriate permit
revision procedures. See 59 FR 47106. The commenters argued that part 70 clearly recognizes that sources may not be
in compliance with all provisions of a title V permit and that State variance provisions, such as Oregon's, are consistent
with part 70, in particular, 40 CFR 70.5(c)(8)(iii) and 70.6(c)(3). The commenters further objected to any implication
that a variance granted by the State does not have any effect on a source's compliance requirements or the extent to
which a source can be subject to enforcement action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA agrees with the commenters that part 70 recognizes that some title V sources will not be in compliance with all terms
of their title V permits. Section 70.5(c)(8)(iii)(C) requires that a source that will not be in compliance with all
applicable requirements at the time of permit issuance must submit a schedule of compliance and section 70.6(c)(3)
requires the permitting authority to include such a compliance schedule in the source's title V permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA disagrees, however, with the commenters' implicit assumption that a compliance schedule is the same mechanism
and has the same effect as a variance. As the commenters recognize, a compliance schedule included in a title V permit
does not sanction noncompliance with the underlying applicable requirement. See 40 CFR 70.5(c)(8)(C). A variance
properly granted under a State variance provision, and approved by EPA as a revision to the SIP, however, changes the
underlying applicable requirement of the SIP. Because title V requires that all applicable requirements be incorporated
into a source's title V permit, any change to an applicable requirement, such as EPA approval of a variance as a SIP revision,
must also be incorporated into the source's title V permit through appropriate permit revision procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, the commenters' concerns are premature at this time. As the commenters acknowledge, EPA is not taking any
action on Oregon's variance provisions in this final action on Oregon's title V program.

Small Business Assistance Program Provisions

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA proposed that, as a condition of obtaining full approval, Oregon must ensure that no source subject to title V will
be immune from inspections or enforcement actions resulting from technical assistance visits conducted under ORS
468A.330(4)(a). See 59 FR 47107&hyph;47108. That provision states that ``Onsite technical assistance for the development
and implementation of the Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance
Program shall not result in inspections or enforcement actions.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter objected to EPA's proposal on this issue, arguing instead that ``EPA's current program for amnesty
for small businesses should be expanded to other sources which conduct voluntary compliance audits'' and that such
a revision would be consistent with Congressional intent. The commenter's reference to ``EPA's current program''
is apparently a reference to EPA's August 12, 1994, guidance memorandum entitled ``Enforcement Response Policy
for Treatment of Information Obtained Through Clean Air Act Section 507 Small Business Assistance Programs'' signed
by Steven A. Herman (herein referred to as the ``SBA Enforcement Guidance''). That document sets forth EPA's position
that State Small Business Assistance Programs which provide small businesses voluntarily seeking compliance assistance
a limited period to correct violations observed or revealed as a result of such assistance are approvable under Section
507 of the Act, provided the State program contains certain conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA disagrees that the Oregon statute is consistent with either title V or the SBA Enforcement Guidance. Section 70.11(a)
requires that States be able to collect a penalty of up to $10,000 per day for each violation in order to obtain title
V approval. ORS 468A.330(4)(a) would preclude Oregon from pursuing an enforcement action against a source if the
enforcement action ``resulted from'' a technical assistance visit conducted under that provision. As discussed
in EPA's proposal, Oregon's statute does not simply give a source a limited period of time in which to correct a violation
observed during a technical assistance visit, but forever shields a source from further inspections or enforcement
actions that ``result from'' a compliance assistance visit. For example, if a State inspector discovered a violation
during a technical assistance visit and the source took no action to correct the violation, ORS 468A.330(4)(a) would
shield the source indefinitely from further inspections or enforcement action unless the State had some independent
reason for visiting the source not related to the information obtained during the technical assistance visit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Oregon Attorney General has opined that no title V source that is a major source is eligible for assistance under
ORS 468A.330(4)(a) because Oregon limits its Small Business Assistance Program to sources that meet the definition
of ``small business stationary source'' under Section 507(b)(1)(C) of the Act. If, however, a source was determined
to be a title V source as a result of a technical assistance visit, ORS 468A.330(4)(a) would preclude the Oregon permitting
authorities from pursing an enforcement action against that source for failure to obtain a title V permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Oregon statute also poses title V approval problems for non-major sources that may later become subject to title
V. In the SBA Enforcement Guidance, EPA interpreted Section 507 of the Act to allow States to grant non-major sources
that meet the eligibility requirements of Section 507(b)(1)(C) a limited opportunity to correct violations observed
during technical assistance visits. Even if EPA were to extend this policy to apply to all sources that conduct voluntary
compliance audits, as the commenter urges, the amnesty granted under Oregon's statute far exceeds that policy. In
short, the Oregon statute is inconsistent with the enforcement requirements of part 70 , even as EPA has interpreted
those requirements under Section 507 of the Act and in the SBA Enforcement Guidance, for certain non-major sources.
Accordingly, EPA maintains that ORS 468A.330(4)(a) bars full approval of Oregon's title V program, but does not preclude
interim approval.

In order to receive full approval, the Oregon permitting authorities must make the following changes: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Upset/Bypass as a Defense to Criminal Liability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Oregon must demonstrate to EPA's satisfaction that ORS 468.959, which provides an affirmative defense to criminal
liability for violations that result from an ``upset'' or a ``bypass,'' as those terms are defined in the Oregon statute,
is consistent with 40 CFR 70.6(g). The affirmative defense under ORS 468.959 is broader than the affirmative defense
under part 70 for emissions in excess of a technology-based emissions limitation caused by an ``emergency'' (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
40 CFR 70.6(g)).

2. Small Business Assistance Program Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Oregon must demonstrate to EPA's satisfaction that ORS 468A.330(4)(a) is consistent with the enforcement responsibilities
of 40 CFR 70.11(a) and the SBA Enforcement Guidance. ORS 468A.330(4)(a) does not simply give a source an opportunity
to correct a violation observed during a technical assistance visit before being subject to enforcement action,
but rather protects the source from follow-up inspections or enforcement activities that ``result from'' observations
made during a technical assistance visit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

As a result of today's final interim approval of Oregon's part 70 programs, the requirement to submit a permit application
to ODEQ or to LRAPA applies to all part 70 sources, as defined in the approved program within the State, except for any
source of air pollution over which a federally recognized Indian Tribe has jurisdiction. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
59 FR 55813, 55815&hyph;55818 (November 9, 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim approval, which may not be renewed, extends until January 2, 1997. During this interim approval period,
the State is protected from sanctions, and EPA is not obligated to promulgate, administer and enforce a Federal operating
permits program in the State. Permits issued under a program with interim approval have full standing with respect
to part 70, and the 1-year time period for submittal of permit applications by subject sources begins upon the effective
date of this interim approval, as does the 3-year time period for processing the initial permit applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the State fails to submit a complete corrective program for full approval by July 2, 1996, EPA will start an 18-month
clock for mandatory sanctions. If the State then fails to submit a corrective program that EPA finds complete before
the expiration of that 18-month period, EPA will be required to apply one of the sanctions in section 179(b) of the Act,
which will remain in effect until EPA determines that the State has corrected the deficiency by submitting a complete
corrective program. Moreover, if the Administrator finds a lack of good faith on the part of the State, both sanctions
under section 179(b) will apply after the expiration of the 18-month period until the Administrator determined that
the State had come into compliance. In any case, if, six months after application of the first sanction, the State still
has not submitted a corrective program that EPA has found complete, a second sanction will be required.

If EPA disapproves the State's complete corrective program, EPA will be required to apply one of the section 179(b)
sanctions on the date 18 months after the effective date of the disapproval, unless prior to that date the State has
submitted a revised program and EPA has determined that it corrected the deficiencies that prompted the disapproval.
Moreover, if the Administrator finds a lack of good faith on the part of the State, both sanctions under section 179(b)
shall apply after the expiration of the 18-month period until the Administrator determines that the State has come
into compliance. In all cases, if, six months after EPA applies the first sanction, the State has not submitted a revised
program that EPA has determined corrects the deficiencies, a second sanction is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, discretionary sanctions may be applied where warranted any time after the expiration of an interim approval
period if the State has not timely submitted a complete corrective program or EPA has disapproved its submitted corrective
program. Moreover, if EPA has not granted full approval to the State program by the expiration of this interim approval
and that expiration occurs after November 15, 1995, EPA must promulgate, administer and enforce a Federal permits
program for the State upon interim approval expiration.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In this Fourth Report and Order the Commission adopts rules that make certain non-equity relationships attributable
interests for purposes of applying the 40 MHz limitation on broadband Personal Communications Service (PCS) spectrum,
the PCS-cellular cross-ownership rules, and the general Commercial Mobile Radio Service (CMRS) spectrum cap. The
Commission concluded that it is not in the public interest to treat resale agreements as attributable interests for
the purpose of applying CMRS multiple-and cross-ownership rules. However, the Commission found that joint marketing
arrangements between competitors in the same geographic area and certain management agreements should be treated
as attributable interests for purposes of spectrum caps. These rules are necessary to ensure that a single entity
will not have the ability to influence or control a large portion of the available mobile wireless spectrum and thereby
undermine competitive pricing for wireless services.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Need for and Objective of Rules
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule making proceeding was initiated to implement Sections 3(n) and 332 of the Communications Act of 1934, as
amended. In prior orders, the Commission has adopted spectrum caps and cross-ownership rules to prevent excessive
aggregation of spectrum. The goal of these limitations is to promote competition by ensuring that the aggregation
of spectrum in a given geographic area does not result in anticompetitive influence over price or service offerings.
The Fourth Report and Order in GN Docket No. 93&hyph;252 adopts attribution rules that make certain management agreements
and joint marketing arrangements attributable interests for purposes of applying the Commission's spectrum cap
rules. In the absence of such attribution rules, there is a risk that management agreements and joint marketing agreements
may undermine our efforts to foster a competitive marketplace for wireless services.

B. Issues Raised by the Public in Response to the Initial Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No comments were submitted specifically in response to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Significant Alternatives Considered
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rules adopted in this Order are narrowly tailored to minimize any intrusive consequences with regard to the operations
of CMRS licensees. The Order does not prohibit management or joint marketing agreements. It finds, however, that
certain management or joint marketing agreements will be treated as creating attributable interests in the licensees
for purposes of the Commission's spectrum cap limitations. The regulatory burdens we have established for all CMRS
licensees, including small entities, are necessary to carry out our duties under the Communications Act of 1934,
as amended. We will continue to examine alternatives in the future with objectives of eliminating unnecessary regulations
and minimizing any significant impact on small entities. A copy of this Order will be sent to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy
of the Small Business Administration.

Synopsis of the Fourth Report and Order
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 18, 1994, the Commission adopted a Second Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making, 59 FR 37734 (July 25, 1994)
in which we sought comment on whether we should consider certain non-equity relationships to be attributable interests
for purposes of applying the 40 MHz limitation on broadband Personal Communications Service (PCS) spectrum, the
PCS-cellular cross-ownership rules, and a more general Commercial Mobile Radio Service (CMRS) spectrum cap. The
Commission also requested comment on whether any attribution rules we might adopt in this proceeding should apply
differently depending on whether the applicant or licensee involved is a designated entity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the Second Further Notice asked whether resale agreements, management contracts, and joint marketing
arrangements that do not confer 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 control on a party should be considered attributable because these interests may affect the incentive or ability
of PCS and other CMRS licensees to compete vigorously in the marketplace or because they may affect the number of effective
competing providers or the independence of pricing decisions by service providers. After close of the comment period,
the Commission released the Third Report and Order, 59 FR 59945 (Nov. 21, 1994), in this docket. In that Order, the Commission
adopted a spectrum cap of 45 MHz on the combined ownership of broadband PCS, cellular radio, and Specialized Mobile
Radio (SMR) licenses that are classified as CMRS. This spectrum cap is in addition to the existing 40 MHz cap on broadband
PCS ownership and the PCS-cellular cross-ownership rules. The Third Report and Order also conformed the rules relating
to station management and control for CMRS providers and stated that we would address whether standards regarding
indicia of control in connection with CMRS management contracts should be further conformed or modified in the context
of our examination of whether to attribute non-controlling management contracts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In an effort to ensure that the significant changes that will be occurring in wireless services produce a robustly
competitive market with a diversity of efficient providers serving a variety of consumer needs, the Commission has
taken steps to prevent excessive aggregation of spectrum through various spectrum caps and cross-ownership rules.
The goal of these limitations is to ensure that a single entity will not have the ability to influence or control a large
portion of the available mobile wireless spectrum and thereby undermine competitive pricing for wireless services.
This Order makes attributable management agreements and joint marketing agreements between licensees that confer
the ability to determine or significantly influence price or service offerings. While such arrangements are considered
attributable, they will not be prohibited by our rules so long as those with attributable interests remain below the
various spectrum thresholds after considering all attributable spectrum.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Order concludes that management agreements, resale, and joint marketing arrangements can enhance the competitiveness
of wireless service providers. Management agreements had been used in the SMR industry and have proven to be beneficial
to the introduction of new technology such as trunked systems and new wide area systems. In certain contexts, however,
they may also be used to facilitate the exercise of market power and produce anticompetitive results.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This Order is concerned with the effects on competition from non-equity arrangements. In the current wireless marketplace
joint marketing arrangements such as MobiLink and Cellular One can be beneficial to consumers. These types of arrangements
facilitate roaming and brand identity without conferring the ability to set or significantly influence the price
or service offerings of individual licensees. However, there may be other joint marketing arrangements that may
confer the ability to significantly influence price and service offerings. In these cases, those arrangements will
be considered attributable and would be prohibited if a party to the agreement exceeded the applicable caps.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Order is also concerned about the effects attributing such arrangements might have on the competitiveness of
designated entities. It finds that considering management contracts attributable interests for purposes of spectrum
caps will not harm competition or efficiency, nor will it harm the ability of designated entities to find suitable
expertise should they wish to do so. Investor/manager agreements are one of many alternatives available to designated
entities and the Commission does not believe that treating management agreements as attributable for designated
entities in exactly the same manner for spectrum cap purposes as for other entities will hamper the competitiveness
of designated entities. This does not mean, however, that these management agreements will be deemed ``attributable''
for purposes of the revenue thresholds in the entrepreneur's blocks. The Order points out that this decision in no
way restricts designated entities (or other licensees) from entering into management or joint marketing agreements
with entities with no attributable interests in the same market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission concludes that it is not in the public interests to treat resale agreements as attributable interests
for the purpose of applying CMRS multiple-and cross-ownership rules. However, the Commission has determined that
joint marketing arrangements between competitors in the same geographic area and certain management agreements
should be treated as attributable interests for purposes of spectrum caps and pursuant to the rules and criteria we
adopt in the Fourth Report and Order.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In response to public comments, petitions submitted by industry, and on their own initiative, the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA), the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA),
the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), the Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA), and the United
States Coast Guard (USCG) (the operating administrations or ``OAs'') have revised their random drug testing rules.
As revised, the rules provide that the OA may lower the minimum random drug testing rate to 25 percent if the industry-wide
(e.g., aviation, rail) random positive rate is less than 1.0 percent for 2 calendar years while testing at 50 percent.
The rate will return to 50 percent if the industry random positive rate is 1.0 percent or higher in any subsequent calendar
year. The industry-wide random positive rate for each transportation industry will be calculated from data submitted
to the OAs and announced yearly by the respective Administrator or the Commandant of the Coast Guard. Based on this
revision, the random drug testing rate for the railroad and aviation industries is reduced by the FRA and FAA Administrators,
respectively, to 25 percent, effective January 1, 1995.

Current Drug Testing Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1988, the Department of Transportation issued six final rules mandating anti drug programs for certain transportation
workers in the aviation, interstate motor carrier, pipeline, maritime and transit industries, and expanded the
requirements of the existing FRA rule. The rules included requirements for education, training, testing and sanctions.
The testing component of each program included pre-employment, post-accident, reasonable suspicion (reasonable
cause), periodic (for those subject to periodic medical examinations), random, and return to duty drug testing for
approximately four million workers in safety-sensitive positions. After a phase-in of one year, the random testing
provisions of the rule required a minimum testing rate of at least 50 percent per year. Implementation of the testing
requirements was delayed in FTA and FHWA due to litigation. Employers regulated by FHWA began random testing of interstate
drivers in 1991 and 1992, and will begin random testing of intrastate drivers in 1995 and 1996. FTA will begin random
testing of large transit operators in 1995 and small transit operators in 1996.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Current Alcohol Testing Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 15, 1994 (59 FR 7302), the FAA, FHWA, FRA, FTA and RSPA published final rules limiting alcohol use by transportation
workers. Four of the OA rules (FAA, FHWA, FRA and FTA) were required by the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing
Act of 1991. RSPA adopted similar, but more limited requirements, based on its own statutory authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA, FHWA, FRA and FTA rules require random testing of safety-sensitive employees in those industries. The rules
provide for an initial minimum random alcohol testing rate of 25 percent. The industry's (e.g., aviation, motor carrier,
rail or transit) random alcohol rate may be adjusted based on a performance standard related to its random alcohol
violation rate. Because of safety concerns, two years of data are necessary to justify lowering the random alcohol
testing rate; one year of data is sufficient to raise it. The OA (in conjunction with the OST Office of Drug Enforcement
and Program Compliance) will review the data and announce in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the minimum annual random alcohol testing rate applicable in the calendar year following publication. If the industry
violation rate is 1 percent or greater during a given year, the random alcohol testing rate will be 50 percent for the
calendar year following the OA Administrator's announcement that the rate must change. If the industry violation
rate is less than 1 percent but greater than 0.5 percent during a given year (for two years if currently at 50 percent),
the random alcohol testing rate will be 25 percent for the calendar year following the OA Administrator's announcement
that the rate must change. If the industry violation rate is less than 0.5 percent during a given year (for two years
if testing at a higher rate), the random alcohol testing rate will be 10 percent the next calendar year.

The ANPRM 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 15, 1992 (57 FR 59778), DOT published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) requesting public
comment and submission of data concerning whether there are less costly alternatives to the current random testing
program that can maintain an adequate level of deterrence and detection of illegal drug use. The ANPRM asked for comment
on a number of alternatives to the current 50 percent random testing rate that DOT could consider. These alternatives
included: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Making an across-the-board modification of the rate for all DOT anti-drug programs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Modifying how the random testing rate is implemented (e.g., frequency of testing, etc.); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Making a selective modification of the rate by: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) operating administration (e.g., FAA or FRA could modify its rate); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) job category (e.g., pilots, train engineers); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) any other category that warranted a different rate based on drug use prevalence or other factors (e.g., age or geographic
region); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Establishing a performance standard program; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Permitting employers who take specified additional steps to deter drug use to reduce their random testing rate;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Modifying the random testing rate for all operating administration rules for a specific time period, subject
to reconsideration after the results are analyzed; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Conducting demonstration programs in each operating administration before further action is taken; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Combining some of the alternatives.

Comments to the ANPRM 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Over 115 comments were filed in response to the ANPRM. Commenters included governmental agencies, trade associations,
regulated entities, unions, contractors and consultants, and individuals. Suggestions ranged from abolition
of all random testing requirements to greatly increasing the current 50 percent testing rate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
About two-thirds of the commenters favored a random testing rate of 25 percent or less. These commenters argued that
the drug problem is not as widespread as originally believed, and that a 25 percent rate would provide substantial
savings while maintaining a serious deterrent effect. Many focused on the cost of the current program and argued that
the savings from reducing the incremental number of tests and associated non-productive time would be significant.
Others took a broader view and noted that other types of tests, training and education were also deterrents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Over a dozen commenters supported the current minimum 50 percent random testing rate. They argued that a decrease
in the testing rate would increase recreational drug use and undermine the deterrent purpose of the program. Several
stated that the data were inadequate to justify a reduction and that costs would not drop because the lower volume would
result in higher per test costs. Others took an ``if it ain't broke, don't fix it'' attitude.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters argued that the rate should be increased. These commenters stated that a greater perception of getting
caught would result in less drug use. One noted that at a 50 percent testing rate, some employees are never tested while
others are tested two or more times per year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In terms of a triggering group, most favored an industry-wide approach. There was some support for setting the rate
by job categories tempered by the concern that such differentiation not be arbitrary. A few commenters suggested
that employers should have flexibility to set the rate at whatever level they thought best, based on their own past
experience.

Technical Meeting
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department held a public meeting on technical issues related to workplace random testing in Washington, DC, on
February 1 and 2, 1993. The meeting, which included presentations by experts from federal agencies, the military,
academia, and private industry, was attended by over 200 people. Transcripts of the meeting are included in the docket.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) on February 15, 1994, (59 FR 7614). The NPRM proposed
that the random testing rate could be lowered to 25 percent by an operating administration if the industry-wide random
positive rate were less than 1.0 percent for 2 consecutive calendar years while testing at 50 percent. The rate would
increase back to 50 percent if the industry random positive rate were 1.0 percent or higher for any entire subsequent
calendar year. Under the proposal, it was possible that different industries would be subject to different rates
in a given calendar year. The NPRM asked for comment on a variety of ways to fine tune this basic approach.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPRM also proposed that each year each Administrator (or Commandant of the Coast Guard) would publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the minimum required percentage for random testing of covered employees during the calendar year following publication.
Any random testing rate change indicated by industry performance would then occur at the beginning of that calendar
year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the NPRM, the Administrator's decision to authorize a decrease (or to require a return to the 50 percent rate) would
be based on the overall positive rate in the industry. The primary source of data would be the Management Information
System (MIS) reports from covered employers submitted to the individual operating administrations. For the aviation
and rail industries, for years prior to the MIS reports, we proposed initially to rely on the data submitted under reporting
requirements that have been in place since FAA's and FRA's random drug testing rules were originally issued.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPRM proposed that, if a given covered employee were subject to random drug testing under the drug testing rules
of more than one DOT agency, the employee would be subject to random drug testing at the percentage rate established
for the calendar year by the DOT agency regulating more than 50 percent of the employee's safety-sensitive functions.
Similarly, the NPRM provided that if an employer were required to conduct random drug testing under the drug testing
rules of more than one DOT agency, the employer could either establish separate pools for random selection, with each
pool containing covered employees subject to testing at the same required rate, or establish one pool for testing
all covered employees at the highest percentage rate established for the calendar year by any DOT agency to which the
employer is subject.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal included several provisions to provide employers greater flexibility or to provide greater clarity.
In addition, RSPA and USCG proposed minor amendments to conform their rule to the Departmental system and eliminate
unnecessary provisions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Approximately forty comments were filed by aviation commenters, nine by the motor carrier industry, eight by maritime
interests, seven by transit, three by pipelines, and two by rail. Forty-four of the commenters were regulated entities,
eighteen represented trade associations, four represented unions, two were from consultants, and one was from a
governmental entity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Almost all the commenters supported reduction of the testing rate and the increased flexibility in tying the testing
rate to the positive rate in a specified population. The commenters differed, however, on how low the rate should be
and what positive rate was low enough to justify reduction. Forty-two of the commenters, including all of the aviation
interests, supported a 10 percent testing rate, in some form. The Air Transport Association/Airline Industrial
Relations Conference, for example, wanted a permanent rate of 10 percent for the larger commercial air carriers (Part
121 and 135 certificate holders.) Alternatively, they suggested that the Department set a testing rate ranging between
25 and 10 percent for the entire industry or airline segment, or adopt the three-tiered system in the alcohol testing
rules. The Regional Airline Association, on the other hand, suggested that 10 percent of covered employees be tested
annually for either drugs or alcohol. The Metropolitan Transit Authority of New York, the American Movers Conference,
the Transportation Trade Department of the AFL-CIO, and the American Trucking Associations also argued for a 10 percent
testing rate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Twenty-three commenters supported the NPRM proposal of a reduction to 25 percent. These included all of the marine
commenters (American Maritime Officers, American Waterways Operators, Inland Steel, the International Association
of Drilling Contractors, the Lake Carriers' Association, Sailboats, Inc., Sealand, and the Transportation Institute),
all of the pipeline commenters (Columbia Gas, Enron and Questar), the Association of American Railroads, six motor
carrier commenters (including the American Bus Association, the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association
and the Regular Common Carrier Conference), several transit commenters (the American Public Transit Association,
the South Bend Public Transportation, and the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority), the State of Michigan
Department of Transportation, and the Institute for a Drug-Free Workplace. In general, these comments reiterated
and supported the arguments made in the NPRM.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters, including the Substance Abuse Program Administrators Association, Substance Abuse Management,
the Bay Area Rapid Transit, and Connecticut Transit supported maintaining the current 50 percent testing rate. They
stated that the current rules are effective, that a reduction in the rate alone would not produce significant savings,
and that DOT should explore other cost-saving alternatives. One transit system believed that a reduction in the testing
rate by DOT would undermine local discretion to continue testing at a higher rate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters suggested a number of variations to the reduction mechanism proposal in the NPRM. The Regulated Common
Carriers wanted the Department to use a 2.0 percent positive rate benchmark for 25 percent random testing. The American
Trucking Associations (ATA) had a lengthy and complex submission. It wanted DOT to lower the testing rate to 25 percent
by January 1, 1995; drop to 10 percent if a motor carrier's positive rate were less than 1.5 percent; change the 2 year
rule to 1 year; and randomly collect past data from carriers. ATA claimed that reduction to 25 percent would save the
motor carrier industry $300 million per year with no adverse effect on safety. ATA surveyed 300 ATA motor carrier members
concerning their drug testing experience in calendar year 1992. Of the 120 members who responded, approximately
75 percent of the responders began testing at a 50 percent rate. They conducted 22,577 tests with 271 positives, which
equals a 1.20 percent positive rate. Twenty-five percent of the responders tested at a 25 percent rate. Of the 2,745
tests conducted, there were 36 positives, which equals a 1.31 percent positive rate. According to ATA, this shows
that there is no significant difference in the positive rate based on 50 percent or 25 percent testing. It was not clear,
however, why the respondents were testing at different rates.

Eighteen commenters addressed the issue of what is the appropriate grouping for triggering a potential reduction
in the testing rate. Thirteen commenters (including the American Trucking Associations, the American Movers Conference,
the American Public Transit Association, the National Air Transportation Association, the Regulated Common Carrier
Conference, all the pipeline submissions, and a number of smaller aviation and motor carrier interests) suggested
the rates be determined for each company or operator. The Air Line Pilots Association and the Allied Pilots Association
suggested that the rates be determined by job category. Several comments favored a breakdown by industry segment
(e.g., intercity buses, aviation contractors, offshore mobile drilling units) or by state.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most of the commenters were anxious to institute a reduction in the testing rate as soon as possible and to ensure that
the testing rate would not be raised without good cause. A number of commenters were concerned by the relatively long
time before there was any possibility of reducing the random testing rates in most of the industries. These commenters,
therefore, wanted the Department to expedite or ``fast track'' the potential reduction in testing rates. Many marine
and motor carrier commenters, for example, asked that DOT either randomly collect or specifically require reports
of past years' data that employers are required to maintain. These commenters suggested that DOT should consider
this retroactively-collected data to determine whether a reduction is warranted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There were a number of comments on the appropriate number of years for lowering or raising the random testing rate.
For example, several commenters strongly argued that DOT should allow the testing rate to be reduced based on one year
of data. The Air Transport Association stated that an increase in the testing rate should be based on either 3 years
of data that demonstrate a clear upward trend or a significant increase in any 1 year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters were concerned that recent changes in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Mandatory
Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug-Testing Programs, as incorporated in 40 CFR Part 40, will result in more frequent
identification of the presence of THC (the active ingredient in marijuana) on screening tests, thus leading to an
increase in the number of positive tests. These commenters argued that the Department should make a special accommodation
in the rules to account for this expected increase.

In addition to the public comments to the rulemaking, the Department considered the following drug testing data in
the regulated industries, the Department's civilian workforce, and the U.S. Coast Guard military personnel. The
data do not include refusals to be tested. The operating administration data reflect phase-in of random testing from
25 percent to 50 percent unless otherwise noted.

In July 1991, the FRA initiated a comparative study of different random testing rates and the impact on deterrence,
as measured by the positive rate. The study compared four railroads testing at 50 percent (control group) with four
railroads testing at 25 percent (experimental group). The positive rate for the control group when the study was initiated
was 1.1 percent; for the experimental group it was 0.89 percent. In the first year (July 1991 through June 1992), the
control group positive rate was 0.90 percent, the experimental group's was 0.87 percent. For the period July 1992
through June 1993, these groups had positive rates of 0.80 percent and 0.94 percent, respectively. During the third
year, the experimental rate was 0.86 percent and the control rate was 0.77 percent. The three-year totals were 0.89
percent for the experimentals and 0.82 percent for the controls.

The Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991 (P.L. 102&hyph;143, Title V, Section 5) required FHWA to
conduct a demonstration project to study the feasibility of random roadside alcohol and controlled substances testing.
It was partly designed to ``serve as a test of, and establish a record on, the effectiveness of state-administered
testing in detecting individuals, such as independent owner-operators and independent drivers, who might otherwise
avoid detection though the carrier-administered testing directed by the [Omnibus Act].'' S. Rep. 102&hyph;54,
p. 34. The pilot program was administered under the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program (MCSAP), which is a federal
grant program that assists states in enforcing motor vehicle safety laws and regulations. The pilot program sampled
drivers holding commercial drivers licenses operating only on interstate highways and major state roads.

The states of New Jersey, Minnesota, Nebraska, and Utah were selected to participate in the program because they are
representative of various geographic and population characteristics. During the course of the year-long study
in each state, over 30,000 random drug tests were conducted. Minnesota and New Jersey combined probable cause testing
with requests for voluntary urine samples. In some states, drivers could refuse to submit to the drug tests without
sanction. The percent positive may also be understated because drivers could have avoided the testing site if they
were aware of the testing through communications on CB radios or other informal information networks. The results
were as follows:

FHWA conducted a one-time special field study of compliance reports. In general compliance investigations of 4,967
interstate motor carrier drug testing programs in the first six months of FY 1993, 28,250 random tests were conducted.
There were 878 verified positive results (3.11 percent). The audits represent less than 2 percent of the motor carriers
subject to the FHWA rule. The FHWA selects interstate motor carriers for general safety rule compliance investigations
by factors such as a safety rating or prior compliance problem. These compliance investigations do not offer scientific,
statistically unbiased sampling methods.

In the Department's federal employee testing program, the random testing rate of at least 50 percent was phased-in
from 25 percent to 50 percent over the first year of the program and achieved at the end of FY 1988. A testing rate of at
least 50 percent was maintained in FY 1989&hyph;1991. In FY 1992, the figures include testing over the first five months
with a rate of at least 50 percent, followed by seven months of testing with a rate of at least 25 percent. FY 1993 figures
reflect a full year of testing at 25 percent. The following table summarizes DOT federal employee random testing data.

As noted earlier, the USCG has been conducting random drug tests on its active duty and reserve uniformed personnel.
Rather than setting a specific testing rate as a requirement at the beginning of the fiscal year, the USCG conducts
the maximum number of tests possible from the funds that are appropriated. The percentage of positive results for
random tests in each fiscal year and the approximate testing rate is as follows:

The Final Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The final rule adopts the NPRM with one change. It provides that the Administrator or the Commandant may lower the minimum
random drug testing rate to 25 percent if the industry-wide (e.g., aviation, rail) random positive rate is less than
1.0 percent (including refusals to be tested) for 2 consecutive calendar years while testing at 50 percent. The rate
will return to 50 percent if the industry random positive rate is 1.0 percent or higher in any subsequent calendar year.
The only change is a one-time adjustment for the two industries that have not yet fully implemented random drug testing.
Under this provision, the FTA and/or FHWA Administrators may allow the testing rate for their regulated industry
to be lowered based on 1995 and 1996 data from those entities required to report. The FTA Administrator will not have
to wait until he has the first 2 years of data from small transit operators and the FHWA Administrator will not have to
wait until he has the first two years of data from small intrastate motor carriers and motor coach operations before
they can possibly lower the rate as proposed in the NPRM. Many of these decisions mirror the reasoning we used in the
final rules concerning alcohol testing that were published on February 15, 1994 (59 FR 7302).

Readers may wish to review the preamble to the alcohol testing rules to supplement their understanding of our actions
in this final rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The final rule provides that the positive and random testing rates will be determined for each industry, and not by
employers or industry segment. After careful consideration, we believe that this is the fairest and most effective
approach. It addresses broad safety issues in each industry rather than by company or segment of the workforce. It
provides a strong incentive for employers with successful programs to pressure problem subgroups to improve their
performance. As an administrative matter, it is much easier for the industry to implement and DOT to oversee and enforce
an industry-wide program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters, such as airline pilots, said that such an approach is unfair. Similarly, there are certain employers
that are so large that their sheer numbers may skew an entire industry's positive rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We acknowledge that breaking up industries into subgroups may be desirable from the point of view of subgroups with
lower positive rates. Nevertheless, after careful consideration, we have chosen not to take this approach for several
reasons. It allows us to focus on broad safety issues and keep the focus away from potentially endless splitting and
balkanization within the industries. If the Department, for example, divided an industry into large and small operators,
a particular large operator with very low positives may ask to be separated or certain categories of employees within
one of the groups may ask then to be distinguished. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Breaking industries into different subgroups would have many undesirable consequences. As a practical matter,
it would be extremely difficult and costly for DOT to administer and enforce. There would be less pressure on very poorly
performing subgroups to improve, especially when the existing industry-wide rate was close to 1.0 percent. There
might be greater incentive to cheat, especially if the rates were determined by company or small subgroups. Significantly
more employees would fall into more than one category, which would cause unnecessary confusion in ensuring random
selection and recordkeeping. It would be much harder for consortia to keep track of and ensure the integrity of the
data. Finally, it might lead to grouping by demographics.

The Testing Rates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The final rule maintains the initial 50 percent random drug testing rate. We believe that this is the appropriate testing
rate for industries that are beginning their testing programs. In order to provide incentive for lowering drug usage
in a given industry, the Department will allow the random testing rate to be lowered to 25 percent based on demonstrably
low annual positive testing rates. The decision will primarily be based on data submitted to the Department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under existing MIS rules, certain employers must submit data for a given calendar year by the following March 15th.
The Office of Drug Enforcement and Program Compliance in the Office of the Secretary (OST) and each operating administration
will review each industry's data for accuracy and completeness and issue a determination regarding the random test
rate within a few months. Because covered entities need some lead time to adjust their procedures, make changes in
any contracts, and take other necessary action to adjust to an increase or decrease, the notice will be published in
advance of the next calendar year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We recognize that because the reported positive rate is obtained from data the precision of which is eroded by sampling
variance and measurement error, and whose accuracy is diminished by non-response bias, there is a risk that it diverges
from the actual positive rate in the population. Each operating administration will be using MIS data collection
and sampling methods that address these issues to the extent possible and make sense in the context of its particular
industry. Where not all employers are included in the reported data, the operating administration will decide how
many covered employers must be required to report or be sampled; this decision will be based on the number of employers
(not otherwise required to report) that must be sampled to ensure that the reported data from the sampled employers
reliably reflect the data that would have been received if all were required to report. However, the decision on whether
the reported data reliably support the conclusion (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
an audit of company records shows significant falsification of reports) remains subject to DOT's discretion. If
the reported data are not sufficiently reliable, the operating administration will not permit the random rate adjustment
to occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each operating administration will publish a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 stating what the random testing rate will be in the following year. Any random rate adjustment will occur at the beginning
of the calendar year in order to maintain the integrity of the MIS data. The Department may also use a variety of other
tools such as press releases, special mailings, or briefings for key industry and press representatives to disseminate
information regarding any rate adjustments.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As proposed in the NPRM, the random testing rate may be reduced to 25 percent if the industry-wide random positive rate
is less than 1.0 percent for 2 consecutive calendar years while testing at 50 percent. Such a performance-based approach
rewards ``good'' results while maintaining an acceptable level of deterrence, as well as detection. Based on the
comments filed and the experiences of the DOT internal program, we believe that reducing the random testing rate to
25 percent could save up to 40 percent of the annual random testing costs incurred at the full 50 percent rate. A two-tier
system makes the drug testing rule more consistent with the alcohol testing rule while acknowledging the difficulty
of identifying drug use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe that 1.0 percent is the appropriate level at which to permit a reduction or require an increase for the reasons
stated in the NPRM. This level is based on the experience that the military and other workplace programs have had with
deterrence-based drug testing. Their results reveal that no matter what rate is used for random testing, the testing
programs never achieve zero positives. There always is a constant group of ``hard-core'' individuals of less than
1.0 percent of the population who are detected positive over a period of time; these individuals are unaffected by
deterrence-based testing because of addiction or belief that they can escape detection. Several commenters asked
us to raise the level, primarily to make it easier for their industry to qualify for a reduction in the testing rate.
We were unpersuaded, however, by these commenters because we believe it is not appropriate to raise the level to ease
compliance, would unduly undermine the important safety objectives of the program, and is an appropriate cut-off
in light of what we believe are achievable goals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As mentioned above, many commenters, particularly in the aviation industry, strongly supported a 10 percent testing
rate. They noted that the alcohol testing rules provide a three-tier system (50 percent /25 percent /10 percent),
and believe that if performance were adequate, an industry, or industry subgroup, should be permitted to test at a
10 percent rate. To the extent that costs are reduced with the number of tests conducted, a 10 percent testing rate would
provide important cost savings to the best employers with the smallest drug use problem. On a more intangible level,
it would provide a goal for employers. It also would be the most flexible approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the NPRM, we noted our tentative conclusion that a 25 percent random testing rate is the minimum effective rate to
ensure deterrence for drug use and to allow at least a modicum of detection. There were a number of comments that stated
that merely being subject to random testing provided adequate deterrence and detection. Some employer commenters
stated that covered employees were unaware of the specific testing rates and that the employees believed that they
could be caught at any time. Others denied that their company or industry had any significant problem and considered
any but the most minimal testing a waste of time, money and energy. Others focused on the best way to spend the finite
resources that could be devoted to drug use prevention. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in the NPRM, illegal drug use is different from alcohol misuse and these differences argue for a higher
random drug testing rate. Drug usage is often harder to detect based on behavior and physical clues such as breath and
body odor, or drug packaging. Alcohol passes through the body relatively quickly, while many drugs stay in the system
for days, weeks or even months. Unlike alcohol use, most drug use is illegal and drug testing helps ensure deterrence
and detection of even off-duty use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Considering the vital public interest in protecting the safety of our transportation system and the data that show
the deterrent and detection benefits of high random rates for drugs, the Department cannot justify permitting a reduction
to 10 percent. Statistically, lowering the rate to 10 percent would result in less representative data since so few
employees would be tested. Fewer tests result in less detection. So few tests would be conducted at a 10 percent rate
that it might take a long time to notice any adverse effects or trends. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Data Required To Raise or Lower Testing Rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is requiring two years of data before a potential reduction in the testing rate because we want to make
sure that the use of drugs is, in fact, demonstrably low and the data reflect more than a statistical aberration or an
unusual year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, if an industry's data indicate a positive rate at or above 1.0 percent in any calendar year, we will
raise the testing rate based on only one year's data. Our primary interest is ensuring safety and it is important to
take a conservative approach. Under our approach, however, there is up to one years' time lag between a rise in positive
test results and an increase in the random testing rate. In extraordinary circumstances that endanger public safety,
we may need to take emergency action before the beginning of the calendar year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

One-Time Exception 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There is one relatively minor change from the NPRM. Large transit companies and intrastate motor carriers will begin
random testing on January 1, 1995, and small transit companies and intrastate motor carriers on January 1, 1996. If
we required a positive rate of less than 1.0 percent for two years of testing at a 50 percent rate for the transit and motor
carrier industries, the rate could not be lowered until January 1, 1999, at the earliest. Because interstate motor
carriers have been testing for several years and transit and intrastate motor carriers can learn much from other transportation
employers that have been testing for a number of years, and because FTA and FHWA will have received a significant amount
of data over the first two years, we will provide a one-time exception from this general rule and allow the random testing
rate to be reduced based on only one year of data from the entire industry and two years from its large entities. The Secretary,
in consultation with the FTA and/or FHWA Administrators does, however, explicitly reserve the discretion to require
another year of data from the small entities if he or she deems it necessary for safety. If the Department's review of
the data indicates that it is insufficient to make a determination to lower the random testing rate to 25 percent, we
will issue a notice stating that the rate will not be changed until one more year of data has been obtained.

Other Provisions

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are not making any change in the rule to account for the change in the marijuana initial test cutoff levels. The change
merely allows for more urine specimens that contain marijuana metabolites to be identified. To the extent that there
is minimal drug use in a given industry, this technical change should make little difference. That we will now be more
successful in correctly identifying positive samples is no reason to make the DOT drug testing rules more lenient.
Improvements in technology that permit us to identify users who previously escaped detection are not a reason for
lowering our standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The remainder of the proposals in the NPRM drew no public comment and are adopted without change. The final rule provides
that if a given covered employee is subject to random drug testing under the drug testing rules of more than one DOT agency,
the employee is subject to random drug testing at the percentage rate established for the calendar year by the DOT agency
regulating more than 50 percent of the employee's function. Similarly, the final rule provides that if an employer
is required to conduct random drug testing under the drug testing rules of more than one DOT agency, the employer may
either establish separate pools for random selection, with each pool containing covered employees subject to testing
at the same required rate, or establish one pool for testing all covered employees at the highest percentage rate established
for the calendar year by any DOT agency to which the employer is subject. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the employer conducts random testing through a consortium, the number of tests to be conducted may be calculated
for each individual employer or may be based on the total number of covered employees subject to random testing by the
consortium. In order to ensure deterrence, the dates for administering random tests must be spread reasonably throughout
the calendar year . 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule contains a number of definitions that mirror the alcohol testing rules. The term ``positive rate''
is defined in the definition section of each operating administration drug rule as, ``the number of positive results
for random tests conducted under this part plus the number of refusals of random tests required by this part, divided
by the total number of random tests conducted under this part plus the number of refusals of random tests required by
this part.'' ``Refuse to submit'' means ``a covered employee [who] fails to provide a urine sample as required by 49
CFR Part 40, without a valid medical explanation, after he or she has received notice of the requirement to be tested
in accordance with the provisions of this part, or engages in conduct that clearly obstructs the testing process.''
As a practical matter, this means that refusals to take a random drug test count as a positive result and would be added
to the total number of random tests conducted for the purpose of calculating the industry positive rate. Since they
are treated as if they are positive in terms of most of the rules' consequences, we believe they should be counted in
the totals. Moreover, without this approach, the system could be easily abused. For example, employers with high
positive rates might have an incentive to subtly communicate that employees who test positive will be fired but employees
who refuse to be tested will receive little or no punishment other than facing removal from duty and evaluation. The
FAA, FRA and USCG also have other sanctions for refusals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adulteration of a urine sample is considered a refusal to test because it constitutes an obstruction of the testing
process. As such, adulterated specimens are included in the calculation of the industry positive rate. Administrative
or procedural errors during the testing process, such as breaking the container holding the sample, that result in
canceled tests are not counted in the totals when calculating the industry random test rate.

The Coast Guard is also removing existing (and no longer applicable) regulatory language that allowed existing marine
employers to begin their random drug testing at a 25 percent annual rate (46 CFR 16.205(d)). This provision was included
to reduce the initial burden that the then-new random drug testing program would impose on employers. Because the
provision no longer serves any purpose, and may lead to confusion, the Coast Guard has removed this regulatory language.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA is revising the random testing cycle to a calendar year beginning on January 1 and ending December 31. The December
23, 1994, Management Information System final rule requires operators to collect specified drug testing data in
1994, and to report that information to RSPA on an annual basis beginning in 1995. Previously, operators had conducted
random testing and maintained records on an April-April or August-August cycle. The revision will allow operators
to conduct random testing and collect their drug testing data on a calendar year cycle.

The FAA is adding three definitions and amending a third definition to make the drug testing rule clearer and to parallel
the alcohol testing rule. ``Contractor company'' is defined to mean ``a company that has employees who perform safety-sensitive
functions by contract for an employer.'' ``DOT agency'' is defined to mean ``an agency (or `operating administration')
of the United States Department of Transportation administering regulations requiring drug testing (14 CFR part

; 46 CFR part 16; 49 CFR parts 199, 219, and 382) in accordance with 49 CFR part 40.'' The FAA is also adding a provision
to clarify current requirements concerning access to records. The provision provides that an employer required
to conduct random drug testing under the anti drug rules of more than one DOT agency shall provide each such agency access
to the employer's records of random drug testing, as determined to be necessary by the agency to ensure the employer's
compliance with the rule. This provision is designed to resolve some confusion regarding compliance monitoring
of multi-modal pools.

Based on the 1992&hyph;1993 data submitted to FRA and FAA, the railroad and aviation industries may begin testing
at a minimum 25 percent random rate beginning January 1, 1995, because their positive rates were less than 1.0 percent
in 1992 and 1993. Pipeline and marine employers will continue testing at 50 percent until they have 2 years of data showing
that random positive rates for their industries are less than 1.0 percent. If the positive rates are below 1.0 percent
for 1994 and 1995, then testing rates may be lowered to 25 percent beginning January 1, 1997. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interstate motor carriers are currently testing at a minimum 50 percent testing rate and will continue to do so until
the positive rate for the entire motor carrier industry (both interstate and intrastate and motor coach operations)
is less than 1.0 percent. Large intrastate motor carriers will begin random drug testing at a minimum 50 percent testing
rate on January 1, 1995, and small intrastate motor carriers will begin random testing at a 50 percent rate on January
1, 1996. We will allow the motor carrier industry to reduce its testing rate to 25 percent beginning on January 1, 1998,
if the 1995 and 1996 data for those required to conduct random testing under the FHWA rule demonstrate a positive rate
of less than 1.0 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Large transit operators will begin random drug testing at a minimum 50 percent testing rate on January 1, 1995, and
small transit operators will begin random testing at a 50 percent rate on January 1, 1996. If the 1995 and 1996 data for
large transit operators combined with the 1996 data for small transit operators demonstrate a positive rate of less
than 1.0 percent, we will allow the transit industry to reduce its testing rates to 25 percent beginning on January
1, 1998. Industries that do not meet the criterion will continue to test at a minimum 50 percent random testing rate.

The final rule is considered to be a significant rulemaking under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, 44 FR 11034,
because of the substantial public and Congressional interest in this subject. A regulatory evaluation has been prepared
and is available for review in the OST docket. This final rule was reviewed by the Office of Information and Regulatory
Affairs pursuant to Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA estimates an average potential cost savings of approximately $9 million per year for the aviation industry if
the testing rate is dropped to 25 percent. USCG estimates an annual cost savings of between $0.8 million to $1.6 million
annually for maritime; RSPA estimates $1.4 million or more per year for pipelines; FRA estimates $1 million per year
for the railroad industry; FHWA estimates $107 million per year or more for motor carriers; and FTA estimates an average
of $7 million per year or more for transit. Further detail is available in the OST final regulatory evaluation and the
OA preliminary regulatory evaluations, which are available in the respective dockets.

and it has been determined that it does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of
a Federalism Assessment.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the current positive testing rate data, the aviation and rail industries will qualify for a reduction to a
25% testing rate in 1995. Although this change will result in substantial cost savings, there will be little economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities in those industries. It is difficult to project which other transportation
industries are likely to qualify for a reduction in the testing rate. The remaining transportation industries (motor
carriers, pipelines, maritime, and transit) include many small companies. If the random testing rate were reduced
in any of those industries, there might be a significant cost savings, as discussed in the accompanying regulatory
evaluation. In addition, to the extent that the rate is lowered it might have a negative economic impact on those who
provide services to employers covered under the rules, some of whom are small entities. Under the best circumstances,
however, motor carriers, transit and pipeline industries could not reduce their testing rates until 1998. We therefore
certify that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities for at
least the next several years.

There are a number of reporting or recordkeeping requirements associated with DOT-mandated drug testing. Some of
the requirements are currently part of the OAs' drug testing rules and some have been incorporated as a result of the
final rules setting up the management information systems that were published in the

on December 23, 1993. To the extent that fewer random tests are required in a given transportation industry, there
will be a proportionate reduction in recordkeeping, but no change in the reporting requirement.

C. Random testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Except as provided in paragraphs 2 &hyph;4 of this section, the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing
shall be 50 percent of covered employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Administrator's decision to increase or decrease the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing
is based on the reported positive rate for the entire industry. All information used for this determination is drawn
from the statistical reports required by section X of this appendix. In order to ensure reliability of the data, the
Administrator considers the quality and completeness of the reported data, may obtain additional information or
reports from employers, and may make appropriate modifications in calculating the industry positive rate. Each
year, the Administrator will publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing of covered employees. The new minimum annual percentage
rate for random drug testing will be applicable starting January 1 of the calendar year following publication. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. When the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing is 50 percent, the Administrator may lower this
rate to 25 percent of all covered employees if the Administrator determines that the data received under the reporting
requirements of this appendix for two consecutive calendar years indicate that the reported positive rate is less
than 1.0 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. When the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing is 25 percent, and the data received under the reporting
requirements of this appendix for any calendar year indicate that the reported positive rate is equal to or greater
than 1.0 percent, the Administrator will increase the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing to 50
percent of all covered employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The selection of employees for random drug testing shall be made by a scientifically valid method, such as a random-number
table or a computer-based random number generator that is matched with employees' Social Security numbers, payroll
identification numbers, or other comparable identifying numbers. Under the selection process used, each covered
employee shall have an equal chance of being tested each time selections are made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The employer shall randomly select a sufficient number of covered employees for testing during each calendar year
to equal an annual rate not less than the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing determined by the Administrator.
If the employer conducts random drug testing through a consortium, the number of employees to be tested may be calculated
for each individual employer or may be based on the total number of covered employees covered by the consortium who
are subject to random drug testing at the same minimum annual percentage rate under this part or any DOT drug testing
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Each employer shall ensure that random drug tests conducted under this appendix are unannounced and that the dates
for administering random tests are spread reasonably throughout the calendar year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. If a given covered employee is subject to random drug testing under the drug testing rules of more than one DOT agency,
the employee shall be subject to random drug testing at the percentage rate established for the calendar year by the
DOT agency regulating more than 50 percent of the employee's function. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. If an employer is required to conduct random drug testing under the drug testing rules of more than one DOT agency,
the employer may_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Establish separate pools for random selection, with each pool containing the covered employees who are subject
to testing at the same required rate; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Randomly select covered employees for testing at the highest percentage rate established for the calendar year
by any DOT agency to which the employer is subject. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. An employer required to conduct random drug testing under the anti drug rules of more than one DOT agency shall provide
each such agency access to the employer's records of random drug testing, as determined to be necessary by the agency
to ensure the employer's compliance with the rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(2) through (4) of this section, the minimum annual percentage rate for random
drug testing shall be 50 percent of covered employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Administrator's decision to increase or decrease the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing
is based on the reported positive rate for the entire industry. All information used for this determination is drawn
from the drug MIS reports required by this subpart. In order to ensure reliability of the data, the Administrator considers
the quality and completeness of the reported data, may obtain additional information or reports from operators,
and may make appropriate modifications in calculating the industry positive rate. Each year, the Administrator
will publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing of covered employees. The new minimum annual percentage
rate for random drug testing will be applicable starting January 1 of the calendar year following publication. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing is 50 percent, the Administrator may lower this
rate to 25 percent of all covered employees if the Administrator determines that the data received under the reporting
requirements of &sect;199.25 for two consecutive calendar years indicate that the reported positive rate is less
than 1.0 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing is 25 percent, and the data received under the reporting
requirements of &sect;199.25 for any calendar year indicate that the reported positive rate is equal to or greater
than 1.0 percent, the Administrator will increase the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing to 50
percent of all covered employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The selection of employees for random drug testing shall be made by a scientifically valid method, such as a random
number table or a computer-based random number generator that is matched with employees' Social Security numbers,
payroll identification numbers, or other comparable identifying numbers. Under the selection process used, each
covered employee shall have an equal chance of being tested each time selections are made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The operator shall randomly select a sufficient number of covered employees for testing during each calendar
year to equal an annual rate not less than the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing determined by
the Administrator. If the operator conducts random drug testing through a consortium, the number of employees to
be tested may be calculated for each individual operator or may be based on the total number of covered employees covered
by the consortium who are subject to random drug testing at the same minimum annual percentage rate under this subpart
or any DOT drug testing rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Each operator shall ensure that random drug tests conducted under this subpart are unannounced and that the dates
for administering random tests are spread reasonably throughout the calendar year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) If a given covered employee is subject to random drug testing under the drug testing rules of more than one DOT agency
for the same operator, the employee shall be subject to random drug testing at the percentage rate established for
the calendar year by the DOT agency regulating more than 50 percent of the employee's function. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) If an operator is required to conduct random drug testing under the drug testing rules of more than one DOT agency,
the operator may_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Establish separate pools for random selection, with each pool containing the covered employees who are subject
to testing at the same required rate; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

percent of all covered employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Selection of covered employees for testing shall be made by a method employing objective, neutral criteria which
ensures that every covered employee has a substantially equal statistical chance of being selected within a specified
time frame. The method may not permit subjective factors to play a role in selection, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The FHWA Administrator's decision to increase or decrease the minimum annual percentage rate for alcohol testing
is based on the reported violation rate for the entire industry. All information used for this determination is drawn
from the alcohol management information system reports required by &sect;382.403 of this part. In order to ensure
reliability of the data, the FHWA Administrator considers the quality and completeness of the reported data, may
obtain additional information or reports from employers, and may make appropriate modifications in calculating
the industry violation rate. Each year, the FHWA Administrator will publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing of drivers. The new minimum annual percentage rate
for random alcohol testing will be applicable starting January 1 of the calendar year following publication. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) (1) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing is 25 percent or more, the FHWA Administrator
may lower this rate to 10 percent of all drivers if the FHWA Administrator determines that the data received under the
reporting requirements of &sect;382.403 for two consecutive calendar years indicate that the violation rate is
less than 0.5 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing is 50 percent, the FHWA Administrator may lower
this rate to 25 percent of all drivers if the FHWA Administrator determines that the data received under the reporting
requirements of &sect;382.403 for two consecutive calendar years indicate that the violation rate is less than 1.0
percent but equal to or greater than 0.5 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) (1) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing is 10 percent, and the data received under
the reporting requirements of &sect;382.403 for that calendar year indicate that the violation rate is equal to or
greater than 0.5 percent, but less than 1.0 percent, the FHWA Administrator will increase the minimum annual percentage
rate for random alcohol testing to 25 percent for all drivers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing is 25 percent or less, and the data received

(e) The FHWA Administrator's decision to increase or decrease the minimum annual percentage rate for controlled
substances testing is based on the reported positive rate for the entire industry. All information used for this determination
is drawn from the controlled substances management information system reports required by &sect;382.403 of this
part. In order to ensure reliability of the data, the FHWA Administrator considers the quality and completeness of
the reported data, may obtain additional information or reports from employers, and may make appropriate modifications
in calculating the industry positive rate. Each year, the FHWA Administrator will publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the minimum annual percentage rate for random controlled substances testing of drivers. The new minimum annual percentage
rate for random controlled substances testing will be applicable starting January 1 of the calendar year following
publication. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random controlled substances testing is 50 percent, the FHWA Administrator
may lower this rate to 25 percent of all drivers if the FHWA Administrator determines that the data received under the
reporting requirements of &sect;382.403 for two consecutive calendar years indicate that the positive rate is less
than 1.0 percent. However, after the calendar year 1994 of random testing for interstate motor carriers under part
391, subpart H and the initial calendar year of testing by large employers under this section, the FHWA Administrator
may lower the rate for calendar year 1997, if the combined positive testing rate is less than 1.0 percent, and if it would
be in the interest of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random controlled substances testing is 25 percent, and the data received
under the reporting requirements of &sect;382.403 for any calendar year indicate that the reported positive rate
is equal to or greater than 1.0 percent, the FHWA Administrator will increase the minimum annual percentage rate for
random controlled substances testing to 50 percent of all drivers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) The selection of drivers for random alcohol and controlled substances testing shall be made by a scientifically
valid method, such as a random number table or a computer-based random number generator that is matched with drivers'
Social Security numbers, payroll identification numbers, or other comparable identifying numbers. Under the selection
process used, each driver shall have an equal chance of being tested each time selections are made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The employer shall randomly select a sufficient number of drivers for testing during each calendar year to equal
an annual rate not less than the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol and controlled substances testing
determined by the FHWA Administrator. If the employer conducts random testing for alcohol and/or controlled substances
through a consortium, the number of drivers to be tested may be calculated for each individual employer or may be based
on the total number of drivers covered by the consortium who are subject to random alcohol and/or controlled substances
testing at the same minimum annual percentage rate under this part or any DOT alcohol or controlled substances random
testing rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) Each employer shall ensure that random alcohol and controlled substances tests conducted under this part are
unannounced and that the dates for administering random alcohol and controlled substances tests are spread reasonably
throughout the calendar year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(k) Each employer shall require that each driver who is notified of selection for random alcohol and/or controlled
substances testing proceeds to the test site immediately; provided, however, that if the driver is performing a safety-sensitive
function at the time of notification, the employer shall instead ensure that the driver ceases to perform the safety-sensitive
function and proceeds to the testing site as soon as possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(l) A driver shall only be tested for alcohol while the driver is performing safety-sensitive functions, just before
the driver is to perform safety-sensitive functions, or just after the driver has ceased performing such functions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(m) If a given driver is subject to random alcohol or controlled substances testing under the random alcohol or controlled
substances testing rules of more than one DOT agency for the same employer, the driver shall be subject to random alcohol
and/or controlled substances testing at the annual percentage rate established for the calendar year by the DOT agency
regulating more than 50 percent of the driver's function. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(n) If an employer is required to conduct random alcohol or controlled substances testing under the alcohol or controlled
substances testing rules of more than one DOT agency, the employer may_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Establish separate pools for random selection, with each pool containing the DOT-covered employees who are subject
to testing at the same required minimum annual percentage rate; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Randomly select such employees for testing at the highest minimum annual percentage rate established for the
calendar year by any DOT agency to which the employer is subject.

(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, the minimum annual percentage rate for random
drug testing shall be 50 percent of covered employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Administrator's decision to increase or decrease the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing
is based on the reported positive rate for the entire industry. All information used for this determination is drawn
from the drug MIS reports required by this part. In order to ensure reliability of the data, the Administrator considers
the quality and completeness of the reported data, may obtain additional information or reports from employers,
and may make appropriate modifications in calculating the industry positive rate. Each year, the Administrator
will publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing of covered employees. The new minimum annual percentage
rate for random drug testing will be applicable starting January 1 of the calendar year following publication. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing is 50 percent, the Administrator may lower this
rate to 25 percent of all covered employees if the Administrator determines that the data received under the reporting
requirements of &sect;653.73 for two consecutive calendar years indicate that the reported positive rate is less
than 1.0 percent. However, after the initial two years of random testing by large transit operators and the initial
first year of testing by small transit operators, the Administrator may lower the rate the following calendar year,
if the combined positive testing rate is less than 1.0 percent, and if it would be in the interest of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing is 25 percent, and the data received under the reporting
requirements of &sect;653.73 for any calendar year indicate that the reported positive rate is equal to or greater
than 1.0 percent, the Administrator will increase the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing to 50
percent of all covered employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The selection of employees for random drug testing shall be made by a scientifically valid method, such as a random
number table or a computer-based random number generator that is matched with employees' Social Security numbers,
payroll identification numbers, or other comparable identifying numbers. Under the selection process used, each
covered employee shall have an equal chance of being tested each time selections are made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) The employer shall randomly select a sufficient number of covered employees for testing during each calendar
year to equal an annual rate not less than the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing determined by
the Administrator. If the employer conducts random drug testing through a consortium, the number of employees to
be tested may be calculated for each individual employer or may be based on the total number of covered employees covered
by the consortium who are subject to random drug testing at the same minimum annual percentage rate under this part
or any DOT drug testing rule.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On February 15, 1994, the Department of Transportation published final alcohol testing rules, including a requirement
that evidential breath testing devices be used to conduct alcohol tests. The Department also published a notice of
proposed rulemaking seeking comment on whether blood testing should be used in very limited circumstances (i.e.,
for reasonable suspicion and post-accident tests, where evidential breath testing was not available). After reviewing
the comments, the Department has decided not to authorize blood testing as proposed. The Department's operating
administrations are amending their alcohol testing rules to require employers to submit to the Department reports
of reasonable suspicion and post-accident tests that could not be conducted because breath testing was unavailable.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rulemaking concerns the Department of Transportation's alcohol testing requirements. Larger employers are
required to begin alcohol testing in accordance with the Department's regulations on January 1, 1995. Smaller employers
are required to begin testing on July 1, 1995, or January 1, 1996, as provided in applicable operating administration
rules. Those employers who are scheduled to begin testing January 1, 1995, are expected to be ready to begin testing
on that date, including acquisition of equipment and training of personnel. No postponements of this compliance
date have been granted. Since employers will have been on notice of this compliance date since February 15, 1994, the
Department believes that employers will have had a reasonable time to prepare.

The NPRM 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When the Department proposed the alcohol testing rules that it adopted in February 1994, one of the most important,
most frequently commented-upon issues was the choice of testing methodology. After carefully considering comments
about a variety of methods and devices, including arguments concerning the degree of discretion employers should
have in choosing a testing method, the Department decided that the use of evidential breath testing devices (EBTs)
was the most appropriate approach to take. The Department discussed the reasons for this decision at some length in
the preamble to its alcohol testing procedures rule. See 59 FR 7342&hyph;7347; February 15, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the same time, the Department sought comments, through a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), on whether the Department
should authorize blood testing for alcohol to be used in certain specific, very limited circumstances. See 59 FR 7367&hyph;7371;
February 15, 1994. Under the proposal, blood would be used ``only in those reasonable suspicion and post-accident
testing circumstances where it is not practicable to use breath testing.''

. at 7367. The Department specifically noted that blood testing was ``not intended, under the proposal, to be an equal
alternative method that an employer can choose as a matter of preference.'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The NPRM did not propose re-opening the underlying decision that breath testing is to be the basic testing method
under the rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rationale for the proposal was that ``in some circumstances, the unavailability of EBTs *&blank;*&blank;* may
make breath testing impracticable.''

times and in remote locations *&blank;*&blank;* [I]t may be substantially easier and less costly to arrange for a

Under such circumstances, the NPRM said, it might be better to test using blood, despite its known disadvantages (which
the preambles to both the Part 40 final rule and the NPRM spelled out), than to be unable to complete a reasonable suspicion
or post-accident test. The NPRM noted that there would probably be a small number of such tests per year (roughly estimated
at 2500 per year), which could mitigate the effect of these disadvantages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The remainder of the NPRM proposed procedures that would be used in the event the Department adopted the proposal.
These proposals addressed such subjects as collection procedures, qualification of testing personnel, laboratories
and laboratory procedures, and ``fatal flaws'' that would invalidate tests.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Department received 185 comments on this NPRM. The commenters included 15 transportation employers or their
associations, 9 testing industry organizations, 6 unions, and 155 individual transportation employees. Several
months after the close of the comment period, the Department received additional correspondence on this subject,
but the comments arrived so late in the rulemaking process that it was not practicable to consider them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment was divided on the basic issue of whether blood testing should be authorized. Employee comments were uniformly
against the proposal. Six unions representing transportation workers and 155 individual transportation employees
opposed blood testing. They cited a number of reasons. Blood testing was too invasive, causing pain and fear in many
employees and severely invading employees' privacy. There was no possibility of immediate confirmation. There
would be too much employer discretion as to when blood could be used, which could lead to abuse (e.g., overuse of blood
by employers). Some of these comments expressed concern about incompetent or dangerous collection practices. Two
additional commenters (one of whom favored using blood testing) expressed concern about confrontations arising
from employees who objected to giving blood. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Twenty-five commenters, most of them employers or employer associations, favored blood testing. Thirteen of these
endorsed the NPRM proposal. Most did so on the basis that it would be less costly and more convenient to be able to use
blood testing for reasonable suspicion and post-accident testing. Specifically, commenters were concerned that,
in the absence of a blood option for these types of testing, employers would have to buy an unreasonably large number
of EBTs to cover all their work locations. The other 12 commenters in this group favored much wider discretion for employers,
saying that blood testing should be available for confirmation in all types of testing, with non-evidential devices
(such as saliva devices) available for screening tests. The result would be that EBTs need never be obtained or used.
Employers in the pipeline industry were particularly in favor of this approach, noting that only reasonable suspicion
and post-accident alcohol tests are required for their industry, which has employees at many remote sites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A related issue was how to define ``readily available.'' The NPRM proposed that blood could be used when breath testing
was not ``readily available,'' and asked for comment on what that term should mean. Five commenters believed that
a specific number of hours (e.g., two or eight) should be used as the criterion. That is, if breath testing could not
be performed within that number of hours after the event leading to the test, then blood could be used. Nine commenters,
to the contrary, said that employers should be able to decide when breath testing was readily available, based on such
factors as cost, convenience, or preference. (One comment, on the other hand, said employers should never have this
discretion.) The latter view was advocated by several of the commenters who favored a broader use of blood testing
than the NPRM proposed, as it would reduce the number of occasions on which breath testing would be needed and perhaps
make it possible for some employers to avoid breath testing altogether. Two commenters, representing aviation management
and labor, respectively, disagreed about whether EBTs would typically be available in airports. Two other commenters
proposed more complex schemes for determining when blood testing could be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the question of what laboratories should be used for blood testing, six comments favored using state-certified
laboratories, when they were available. Some of them said that these laboratories should be viewed as adequate at
least until Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) -certified laboratories became available. Ten comments
favored DHHS certification for blood testing laboratories, though these commenters differed among themselves
about whether DHHS-certified laboratories should be the only laboratories permitted to test blood in DOT-mandated
tests. Two other comments favored using laboratories certified by the College of American Pathologists (CAP), and
three others supported using whatever laboratories were available, whether certified by DHHS, states, or CAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eleven commenters thought DOT should develop uniform, national testing procedures. Some of these commenters argued
that state procedures are unreliable or that it would be too confusing to apply a variety of state standards, particularly
for employers who operate in more than one state. Two testing industry organizations suggested using an existing
industry blood collection standard. Eight other commenters thought that state procedures, or procedures developed
at the discretion of the employer, should be viewed as adequate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nine commenters thought employers should either be authorized or required to ``stand down'' employees based on a
positive screening test, pending receipt of the results of the blood confirmation test from the laboratory. Eight
comments favored allowing an employee's supervisor to act as the collector for the screening test, the confirmation
test, or both, at least if other trained collectors were not available. One comment opposed ever allowing a supervisor
to act as a collector. With respect to fatal flaws, nine commenters agreed (and two disagreed) that a sample collected
by an unauthorized collector should be regarded as invalid, eight said it should not be a fatal flaw if the procedures
of the wrong state were used for collection. There were also several comments concerning the details of blood testing
kits.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Department clearly and specifically limited the NPRM to consideration of whether blood testing should be used
for situations in which breath testing was not readily available for reasonable suspicion and post-accident tests,
or in ``shy lung'' situations. For this reason, the issue raised by some commenters of whether employers should have
the flexibility or discretion to use blood testing as an alternative to breath testing, even when breath testing is
readily available in reasonable suspicion and post-accident testing or even in random or pre-employment testing,
is outside the scope of the rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, we remain convinced, for the reasons explained in the preamble to 49 CFR Part 40 published on February 15,
1994, that the Department made a sound decision to designate evidential breath testing as the basic method of alcohol
testing to be used in DOT programs. Consequently, the Department will not authorize the use of blood testing as an alternative
to breath in the wide range of circumstances recommended by some commenters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the NPRM proposal itself, the Department is mindful of the concerns expressed by employees and unions
about the invasiveness of blood testing. As the Department recognized in the preambles to the NPRM and to the February
15 final rule, blood testing is the most invasive type of testing available, and is likely to create more anxiety among
employees than other methods. Blood testing is the only testing method that, if conducted improperly by an ill-trained
or inattentive collector, can do serious physical harm to an employee. Moreover, while we recognize a point made by
some commenters that employees have accepted blood alcohol testing in some circumstances, we think that the greater
invasiveness of this approach would, on the whole, make employee acceptance of the program more, rather than less,
difficult to obtain. Employee acceptance is one factor that leads to the success of an alcohol misuse prevention program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another factor we have taken into consideration is the added program complexity that would result from including
blood testing in the Department's programs. Laboratories would have to be certified to test the blood samples. As
the division among commenters on this point demonstrates, the best solution to this problem is not clear. In our view,
DHHS certification would be the highest standard for accuracy and reliability of testing. However, there would be
considerable costs to laboratories and the Department, as well as some delays in program implementation, if DHHS
had to create a laboratory certification program for blood alcohol testing, as it has for urine drug testing. Assuming
that the number of tests involved is small (see discussion below) it might well not be cost effective for laboratories
to go through a DHHS certification process. State-certified laboratories appear to vary in reputation for quality
as well as in terms of availability; not all states have state or state-certified laboratories that would accept specimens
for purposes of DOT-mandated testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As mentioned in the preamble of the NPRM, the Department has expressly declined to use laboratories certified by private
organizations (such as the CAP) in the drug testing context, and the comments did not provide a persuasive rationale
for taking a different course with respect to alcohol testing. Using state or privately certified laboratories as
an interim measure until DHHS-certified laboratories are ready could create concern among employees and employers
about ensuring the highest level of accuracy in the program. The other procedural issues discussed in the comments_DOT
national uniform procedures vs. reliance on differing state procedures, whether there should be a standard DOT blood
testing kit and what should be in it, what should constitute a fatal flaw, etc._also suggest that it would be a very complex
matter to devise an appropriate set of procedures for blood testing. Other questions arise because of the relationship
of non-evidential screening test devices and blood tests. For example, suppose a saliva screening device indicates
that an employee tests positive for alcohol. The blood test result will not be available from the laboratory for two
or three days. What happens to the employee in the meantime? This is a problem we do not face with evidential breath testing,
since a confirmation test result is available immediately, a point which we view as a significant advantage of breath
testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the drug testing rules, we explicitly prohibit on-site testing, in part for the reason that we consider it inappropriate
for an employer to take any action against an employee, absent a confirmed and verified positive test result. (Concern
about the accuracy of devices was also involved in this decision.) A similar situation would occur if an employee had
a positive on-site screening test for alcohol and the employer stood him or her down pending receipt of the laboratory
confirmation test result. On the other hand, from a safety point of view, there is much to recommend to employers that
they stand an employee down after a positive on-site screening test, since no one wants to send (for example) a truck
driver back onto the road when we have a test result suggesting that the driver may have alcohol in his or her system.
The comments on the subject favored standing employees down in this situation.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Should the Department, contrary to the drug testing rules, permit or require the employer to stand an employee down
in this situation? If the employer stands an employee down in this situation, should DOT rules mandate that the employer
pay the employee for the ``stand down'' period? In any case? Only if the confirmation test is negative? These are difficult
and troubling questions, to which the best answers are far from self-evident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is not to say that the issues of invasiveness, added procedural complexity, and stand-down are incapable of resolution.
But is it worthwhile, from the point of view of employers, employees, and the Department, to create a new component
of the alcohol testing program carrying these problems with it? The basic rationale for adding blood testing to the
program is that, in its absence, employers will ``miss'' post-accident and reasonable suspicion tests. That is,
there will be situations in which, because breath testing cannot be made available within eight hours, a post-accident
or reasonable suspicion test that the regulations call for will not take place at all. In some number of these cases,
blood testing might be available where breath testing is not. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
How often will there be reasonable suspicion and post-accident tests that are ``missed'' because of the unavailability
of breath testing that would be ``caught'' by blood testing? Our expectation is that there would be a small number of
such situations. First, occasions for post-accident and reasonable suspicion tests are likely to be far fewer in
number than occasions for pre-employment and random tests. The motor carrier industry accounts for 7.0 million of
the approximately 7.8 million transportation employees who will be subject to alcohol testing. FHWA's very stringent
criteria for post-accident testing (only a (1) fatal accident or (2) an accident in which the driver is issued a citation
for a moving violation plus either (a) there is disabling damage to a vehicle or (b) an injury requiring immediate medical
treatment away from the scene results in a post-accident test) mean that only a small percentage of all motor carrier
accidents are likely to result in post-accident tests. The nature of drivers' jobs, which do not involve frequent
or long-term observation by supervisors, suggests that there will be relatively few occasions for reasonable suspicion
tests. The pipeline industry, in which most accidents happen because of non-pipeline employees damaging pipelines
(e.g., construction crews digging into a pipeline), and in which employees may often operate in remote locations
with little supervision, appears to share this relatively low probability of reasonable suspicion and post-accident
testing. We also anticipate few ``shy lung'' situations, and Part 40 has a provision to deal with them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other industries, which involve closer supervision of employees and/or broader definitions of triggering accidents
may produce somewhat greater rates of post-accident or reasonable suspicion test situations. (In one of these, the
railroad industry, post-accident blood testing is done by FRA under a long-standing rule using an FRA contract lab.
Nothing in this today's action in any way changes FRA's existing requirements involving blood testing.) However,
since the absolute numbers of employees in these industries are much smaller, they will have less of an effect on the
total number of such occasions. Even in these industries, the numbers may not be very high. Data from the aviation industry,
for example, suggests that there have been relatively few post-accident or reasonable cause drug tests (e.g., 720
out of 268,809 total tests conducted in 1993 under the FAA rule). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This brings us to the next factor. What data we have from situations where reasonable suspicion/cause tests have been
administered for both drugs and alcohol suggests that there may be substantially fewer such tests for alcohol than
for drugs. For example, recent railroad industry data suggest that of the total of such tests, alcohol tests made up
only about 17 percent of the total. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, we expect that a substantial percentage of the reasonable suspicion and post-accident testing situations
can be ``caught'' by breath testing. This is particularly true in those industries (e.g., the railroad, transit,
and aviation industries) where employees perform most safety-sensitive duties on known routes or in known locations,
and where supervision is more readily available. Even in the motor carrier industry, the provision in the FHWA rule
that allows use for purposes of the DOT testing program of results of tests conducted by law enforcement can help to
reduce the incidence of ``missed'' tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, there are likely to be some situations in which no testing method
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_including blood_can be brought to bear in time to conduct a post-accident or reasonable suspicion test. The oft-mentioned
example of a truck accident at 2 a.m. on a remote highway in the middle of the desert may well be an example of a situation
in which blood, as well as breath, testing will not be available in a timely manner. Certainly it would be a doubtful
assumption that all, or perhaps even a majority, of tests that would be ``missed'' with breath would be ``caught''
with blood. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, if we added blood testing to the alcohol testing program as proposed in the NPRM, we would be incurring
the disadvantages of such a step in order to catch a subset of a subset of the universe of all reasonable suspicion and
post-accident alcohol tests required under the Department's rules. This universe itself will probably not be a large
one. Many of the tests can be caught by breath testing. Of those that cannot, many could not be caught by blood testing
either.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NPRM, we made a rough estimate of perhaps 2500 situations per year in which blood would catch a test that breath
could not. Commenters did not present data suggesting that the number would be significantly higher; we tend to think,
at this time, that the estimate may have been too high. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have concluded that it is not worth subjecting employees to an invasive testing procedure and incurring the other
disadvantages of adding blood alcohol testing to our program to capture this probably small number of cases. For this
reason, we are withdrawing the proposed authorization of the use of blood in some post-accident and reasonable suspicion
test situations, and we will not include blood testing as a part of the DOT alcohol testing program. As noted below,
we are issuing a final rule establishing a temporary reporting requirement concerning missed reasonable suspicion
and post-accident tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe that following this course will be less disadvantageous to employers than some commenters appear to believe.
There is no requirement in the DOT rules_and never has been_that employers buy their own EBT for every conceivable
location in which a reasonable suspicion or post-accident test could occur, including every company facility or
location. We expect that companies may move EBTs around from facility to facility for scheduled tests such as pre-employment
and random tests. For the non-scheduled reasonable suspicion and post-accident tests, we expect employers to take
reasonable steps to ensure coverage. We recognize that tests will not be able to be completed in some instances. That
is why, for example, the reasonable suspicion and post-accident testing provisions of the alcohol rules issued by
the operating administrations on February 15, 1994, tell employers to discontinue attempts at testing after eight
hours but require them to keep a record explaining the inability to conduct the test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consortia and third-party service providers can often provide both more economical service and wider coverage than
employers would find possible on their own. Reimbursable agreements among employers, even across various industries,
could make EBT and BAT services available in locations where a single employer would not have coverage. The operating
administrations will also provide guidance and work with their employers to ensure appropriate coverage by employers.
Finally, the Department recognizes that there will be some situations in which the best good faith efforts on the part
of an employer (as distinct from an abdication of the effort) cannot result in a test being completed. That is, we acknowledge
and accept the fact that there will be some ``missed'' tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department's judgment on this issue is based, to a considerable extent, on the premise that there will not be excessive
numbers of ``missed'' tests. This premise, while based on a logical view of how our program will work, is not, at this
stage, based on hard data. This is because the alcohol testing program has not begun yet, so there is little data on which
we can rely. (That is, the first MIS reports for alcohol are not due until March 15, 1996. The first MIS reports for drugs
are not due until March 15, 1995, so we do not even have comprehensive data yet for drug testing in most of the affected
industries which might serve as a basis for inferences about the alcohol testing program.) For this reason, the Department
is modifying an existing regulatory requirement to generate relevant data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All the operating administration alcohol testing regulations include a requirement for employers to prepare and
maintain on file a record of when a post-accident or reasonable suspicion test is not administered within eight hours.
At this point, the employer must stop attempts to administer the test. This is, in other words, an existing requirement
to document a ``missed'' test and the reasons for it. This requirement applies to all covered employers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For a three-year period beginning January 1, 1995, the Department will require those employers who transmit an MIS
report to the Department to transmit a copy of these records along with their MIS report. They should be sent to the same
address as MIS reports are sent for the operating administration involved. Reports should be sent to the operating
administration 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
only 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
at the time that MIS reports are sent. That is, the employer should send a year's worth of reports (a separate report
for each ``missed test'') to the operating administration at one time. Employers should not send reports concerning
tests which are conducted within the 8-hour period, only concerning tests that are not conducted because more than
8 hours have passed since the triggering event. (The existing rules also require employers to document when a reasonable
suspicion or post-accident test cannot be conducted within two hours. This requirement remains in effect, but employers
are not required to report to DOT concerning tests that are conducted more than two but less than eight hours after the
triggering event. This is because such tests, while perhaps of diminished value, are not truly ``missed tests.'')

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule specifies the information that would be part of the records. The required information is the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Type of test. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Is the test a reasonable suspicion or post-accident test? (This information is not required from railroad employers,
since FRA has always conducted post-accident blood tests and does not conduct post-accident breath alcohol testing
parallel to that conducted under other operating administrations' rules. All ``missed tests'' under the FRA rule
would be reasonable suspicion tests.)

Employee category.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 What type of safety-sensitive function was the employee performing? In responding to this item, employers should
use the employee categories listed in each of the operating administrations' regulations (e.g., in mass transit,
operator of a revenue service vehicle, operator of a non-revenue service vehicle, controller/dispatcher, maintenance
personnel, security personnel). These regulatory categories, rather than the employer's job title for the individual,
should be used for this purpose. Under no circumstances should the employee's name or other identifying information
be provided. (This information is not required in reports to FHWA, since all FHWA-covered personnel are drivers.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Explanation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The reason(s) the test could not be completed within 8 hours. That is, what prevented the employer from conducting
the test within this time period using breath testing? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Possible Use of Blood.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If blood testing would have been available to complete the test within eight hours, the record would include the name,
address, and telephone number of the testing site at which blood testing could have occurred. (This information will
help the Department to estimate the frequency of situations in which blood testing would have been available where
breath testing is not.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department will analyze these reports (which, since they concern 1995, 1996, and 1997, will include three years'
data for large employers and two years' data for small employers) in 1998. We will revisit, at that time, the issue of
whether there are sufficient numbers of post-accident and reasonable suspicion testing occasions which are missed
by breath testing and could be captured by blood testing to make the addition of blood testing (or some other, new technology)
a worthwhile step. While this data collection requirement is a response to the issues raised by the NPRM, and is a logical
outgrowth of our consideration of those issues and the comments on them, it was not itself specifically proposed in
that document. Therefore, we are asking for comment on the reporting requirement. Because we believe it is important
to be in a position to have responded to comments on the reporting requirement before January 1, 1995, when alcohol
testing begins and records of missed tests would need to start being kept for the reports that are due March 15, 1996,
we have established a 45-day, rather than a 60-day, comment period on the reporting requirement. This opportunity
for comment concerns only the reporting requirement itself, and not the underlying decision to withdraw the proposal
to allow blood testing. Comments on that decision will be considered as outside the scope of this request for comments.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has determined that this rule is a significant rule for purposes of Executive Order 12886 and the Department's
Regulatory Policies and Procedures. While it makes only small changes to the Department's existing alcohol testing
requirements, it pertains to a Department-wide regulatory program, and has been reviewed by all concerned Departmental
offices and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The costs and benefits of alcohol testing were fully analyzed
as part of the final rules issued February 15, 1994. Because the rule does impose a new reporting requirement, we have
submitted this requirement to OMB for review under the Paperwork Reduction Act. The new reporting requirement will
not be effective until OMB has approved it. DOT will publish a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice when OMB approves the requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Department certifies that the requirements imposed by this rule will not
have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities. There are not sufficient Federalism
impacts to warrant a Federalism assessment under Executive Order 12612.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 15, 1994, RSPA published a final rule (59 FR 7426) to require operators of gas, hazardous liquid, and carbon
dioxide pipelines and liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities, who are subject to 49 CFR part 192, 193, or 195, to implement
alcohol misuse prevention programs for employees who perform certain covered functions. On March 15, 1994, RSPA
received a Joint Petition for Reconsideration and Request for Clarification (Jt. Pet.) of the final rule from the
American Gas Association and the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America (Petitioners). Discussion of the
issues and RSPA's responses follow. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. RSPA Should Stay the Effective Date of the Final Rule on Alcohol Misuse Prevention Programs Until RSPA Issues Final
Rules in Currently Pending Rulemaking Proceedings
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Petitioners noted that, in addition to the alcohol misuse rules, DOT also published two proposed rules on the use
of alcohol screening devices and the use of blood alcohol tests in post-accident and reasonable suspicion situations
when an evidential breath testing device (EBT) is not reasonably available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Petitioners request that RSPA stay implementation of the alcohol misuse rule until such time as DOT issues final
regulations concerning screening devices and blood tests. The Petitioners contend that delaying implementation
of the final rule does not present a safety issue because the type of alcohol testing required by the rule (e.g., post-accident,
reasonable suspicion) is already performed by most natural gas utilities and pipeline operators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Petitioners note that the proposal on alternate screening devices would allow employers to use them to determine
the presence of alcohol and then perform confirmation tests using approved EBTs. With regard to the proposed rule
on blood testing, the Petitioners note that the rule would allow blood tests in post-accident and reasonable suspicion
situations where operators may not have reasonable access to an EBT. The Petitioners are concerned that, to comply
with the current final rule, operators will have to purchase EBTs and train operators, or enter into contractual agreements
for testing with EBTs, only to learn that DOT has now issued a rule authorizing blood testing. The Petitioners are concerned
that pipeline operators will unnecessarily spend thousands of dollars to comply with a rule that may soon be revised.
In addition, Petitioners request that, since pipeline operators are not required to conduct pre-employment or random
alcohol testing, RSPA should allow blood testing as an unqualified alternative to EBTs. The Petitioners state that
in the pipeline industry, where many employees are located at remote sites, there will be numerous situations where
operators will not be able to transport quickly an employee to a testing facility or have a breath alcohol technician
and equipment readily available. Moreover, the Petitioners contend that mandating the use of EBTs will significantly
add to the costs of carrying out alcohol prevention programs, in terms of procuring new equipment, developing training
manuals, and instructing employees on their use, even though there exists a real possibility that operators will
be unable to use the devices in the majority of testing situations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Petitioners note that the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991 did not apply to the pipeline industry,
and therefore RSPA is not constrained by the Act in promulgating alcohol regulations. The Petitioners also note that
DOT's regulations attempt to protect employees from the invasiveness of blood testing, by requiring the use of EBTs.
Petitioners contend, however, that the need for protection is most necessary in a random test, where the employee
has done nothing to warrant being singled out for testing. In contrast, Petitioners state that, in the case of a post-accident
or reasonable suspicion test, employee protection ``is counterbalanced by the need to establish if alcohol use is
a threat to safety or has played a role in an accident.'' (Jt. Pet. at 8).

RSPA Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
RSPA is denying the Petitioners' request. DOT's alcohol testing regulations are based on the concept that evidential
breath testing is the preferred method of testing for the presence of alcohol. The reasons underlying the decision
to select breath testing were discussed at some length in the Common Preamble (59 FR 7315). Evidential breath testing
devices are reliable and highly accurate at detecting even low alcohol concentrations, and their use is possible
in all transportation settings because they are portable. The devices have been in use a long time, and all States accept
EBT results as reliable evidence of an individual's violation of a law establishing a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
per se
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 prohibited blood alcohol concentration, as long as the devices are properly calibrated and operated by trained personnel.
As important, EBTs provide an immediate confirmed result, which enables the immediate removal of an employee who
has misused alcohol. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In contrast, blood alcohol testing is invasive, does not provide an immediate result, and requires extensive sample
collection, shipping, and laboratory analysis procedures to implement. The NPRM on blood testing proposed to allow
blood testing only in a limited set of circumstances where an EBT is not readily available. As stated in the preamble
to the NPRM,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[B]ecause of its greater invasiveness and because it does not produce an immediate result, the use of blood alcohol
testing is intended to be used only in those reasonable suspicion and post-accident testing circumstances where
it is not practicable to use breath testing. Blood alcohol testing is not intended, under the proposal, to be an equal
alternative method that an employer can choose as a matter of preference.

<!-- PJG QTAG 01 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

59 FR 7367.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Regardless of whether the blood testing proposal is adopted, we believe that the pipeline industry must make reasonable
efforts to arrange for the use of a sufficient number of EBTs to conduct reasonable suspicion and post-accident testing.
Pipeline operators may arrange for the use of EBTs through purchase, lease, or contract with a consortium or other
third-party provider. An operator need not purchase EBTs, but can make arrangements with a third party provider for
those relatively few reasonable suspicion or post-accident tests that may need to be conducted. RSPA's experience
with drug testing is that fewer than 3% of the total tests conducted have been in post-accident and reasonable suspicion
situations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We do not expect an operator to arrange for an EBT at every possible testing location, but an operator can certainly
arrange for EBTs in locations where substantial numbers of employees are concentrated, and at any locations where
accident or leak history suggests the need for an EBT. Large operators (those with more than 50 covered employees)
should not encounter difficulty in arranging for the use of EBTs by the January 1, 1995 compliance date. EBTs are readily
available for purchase from several manufacturers, and the inventory of EBTs is sufficient to enable most manufacturers
to ship EBTs in five to ten days. In addition to inventory, there is sufficient production capacity to manufacture
approximately 7,500 new units each month. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has issued
final Model Specifications for the performance and testing of alcohol screening devices (August 2, 1994; 59 FR 39382),
and will soon publish a Conforming Products List (CPL) identifying devices that meet the Model Specifications. The
CPL is expected to include several preliminary breath testing devices (PBTs) and at least one saliva device. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pipeline operators were advised of the final alcohol rule on February 15, 1994, allowing them almost one year (for
large operators) and almost two years (for small operators) to make preparations for compliance with their respective
January 1, 1995, and January 1, 1996 dates. Issuance of this decision on the petition for reconsideration should resolve
any remaining uncertainty and provide sufficient time for operators to achieve compliance by the respective compliance
dates.

2. RSPA Should Clarify Its Position on Dual Modal Coverage
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Petitioners contend that the RSPA final rule does not make clear the status of employees who may be subject to both
the RSPA and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) rules. The Petitioners state that the Common Preamble to the
DOT final rules (59 FR 7301, 7377) ``specifically includes the example of an employee that is a pipeline worker and
holds a commercial drivers license.'' (Jt. Pet. at 8). The Petitioners state that the Common Preamble states that,
based upon an employee's major job function, an employer may designate an employee as either a pipeline employee or
a driver for purposes of random alcohol testing. (59 FR 7337). Petitioners contend that DOT employees have made contradictory
statements regarding this issue, and urge RSPA to clarify that employees who perform pipeline functions the majority
of the time, would not have to be tested under the FHWA rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
RSPA Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
RSPA is granting the request to clarify this issue, but is denying the Petitioners' request to classify an employee,
for testing purposes, solely by the percentage of time the employee spends performing pipeline functions. Therefore,
no change to the rule itself is necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991 (Omnibus Act) amended the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety
Act of 1986 (now codified in 49 U.S.C. 31306) to require that all drivers of commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) who are
required to obtain commercial driver's licenses (CDLs), be subject to testing for the illegal use of alcohol and controlled
substances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, a pipeline employee who is required by his or her employer (a pipeline operator) to hold a CDL as a condition
of employment, and who is required to be available to drive a CMV as part of his or her job, is subject to the FHWA rules,
including random testing. This requirement applies regardless of the amount of time that the employee actually drives
a CMV or performs other safety-sensitive duties as defined in the FHWA regulations under 49 CFR part 382 (e.g., loading/unloading
vehicles, waiting to be dispatched, performing vehicle inspections). The timing of any random test, however, does
depend upon when the employee is performing that driving function. The employee may be subject to random alcohol testing
under the FHWA rules at any time just before, during, or just after driving a CMV. If a pipeline employee may be called
upon to drive a CMV at any time during the work week, then the employee is subject to random testing at any time during
the employee's scheduled work shift. If, however, the employee is called upon to drive a CMV only two days a week (e.g.,
Monday and Friday), then the employee is only subject to random testing on those two days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, 49 U.S.C. 31306 requires that a driver required to obtain a CDL must be subject to pre-employment/pre-duty
testing. Therefore, a pipeline employee who is required to obtain a CDL as a condition of employment, and who is required
to be available to drive a CMV, is subject to pre-employment/pre-duty testing under the FHWA rules. Requirements
for pre-employment/pre-duty testing under the FHWA rules are contained in 49 CFR 382.301. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to post-accident and reasonable suspicion testing, an employee is subject to testing while performing
either pipeline or driving functions. If an employee is involved in accident while driving a CMV, then the operator
should look to the FHWA rules (49 CFR 390.5) to determine whether the accident is one that requires testing. Similarly,
if an employee is involved in an accident while performing a covered pipeline function, the definition of an accident
in section 199.205 applies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conversely, a pipeline employee who is not required by his or her employer (a pipeline operator) to hold a CDL as a condition
of employment and does not drive a CMV as part of his or her job, is not subject to testing under the FHWA rules.

3. RSPA Should Clarify That Operators Are Only Responsible for Preventing Employees From Driving Company Vehicles
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Petitioners state that the ``Background Material'' accompanying the 49 CFR part 40 final regulations states
that employees testing positive for alcohol ``should not drive.'' (59 FR 7340, 7346). Petitioners contend that enforcing
a broad prohibition on driving raises serious legal questions. The Petitioners request that DOT clarify that the
employer's responsibility extends only to limiting employees from driving company vehicles or for company purposes,
and that employers should not be responsible for policing the actions of an employee after he or she has tested positive.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
RSPA Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 RSPA is granting the Petitioners' request to clarify this issue. The preamble to the 49 CFR part 40 regulations states
that the DOT alcohol testing form includes a statement, to be signed by the employee, that persons who test positive
should not drive or perform other safety-sensitive functions. (59 FR 7346). The requirement to sign the statement
applies to the employee, not to the employer. The statement in the preamble that employers have a responsibility,
as part of their alcohol education for employees, to emphasize that employees must cease performing safety-sensitive
functions if they test positive does not mean that employers must police the private conduct of employees who test
positive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The employer's specific responsibility is set forth in 49 CFR 199.215 and 199.237, which provide that an operator
may not permit a covered employee who has an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater to perform or continue to perform
covered functions until certain requirements are met. An operator may not permit such an employee, for example, to
drive a CMV or perform a pipeline safety function. The rules do not require an operator to prohibit an employee from
driving his or her own vehicle after having tested positive. However, under 49 CFR 199.239, an operator has an obligation
to promulgate a policy on the misuse of alcohol, including providing educational materials to employees concerning
the effects of alcohol misuse on an individual's health, work, and personal life. Such materials frequently include
information advising on the dangers of driving while under the influence of alcohol. Therefore, no change to the rule
is necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
4. RSPA Should Clarify That Operators Are Not Responsible for the Storage of EBT Devices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Petitioners state that the DOT regulations in 49 CFR 40.55(c) require that employers store EBTs in a secure space.
The Petitioners contend that it will often be the case that EBTs will not be in the control of the employer, but will be
maintained by hospitals, contractors, and consortiums. Where testing devices are in the possession of others, the
Petitioners contend, employers will have limited ability to control maintenance and operation of the devices. The
Petitioners maintain that all that reasonably can be required of employers is that they contractually require third
parties to abide by the regulations. The Petitioners contend that, as for emergency personnel and hospitals, employers
obviously cannot be required to monitor their operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
RSPA Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 40.55(c) stipulates that when the employer is not using the EBT at an alcohol testing site, the employer shall
store the EBT in a secure space. This provision plainly is directed to those situations when the employer is conducting
the testing, either directly or through a contract with a third party provider. If the employer is conducting the testing,
then the employer must secure the EBT when it is not in use. If the employer is conducting testing through a contractor,
then the contract must provide that the contractor will secure the EBT when it is not in use. Therefore, no change to
the rule is necessary.

5. RSPA Should Clarify That Operators May Combine Drug and Alcohol Training Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Petitioners state that the Common Preamble indicates that employers may combine their alcohol and drug training
programs for supervisors, for a total time of two hours. The Petitioners contend that much of the information pertaining
to detecting alcohol and drug abuse will overlap, and it is not necessary to require a two-hour training session. The
Petitioners urge DOT to clarify that employers need only provide combined training on drugs and alcohol for one hour.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
RSPA Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 RSPA is denying the Petitioners' request. The Common Preamble clearly provides that ``[e]mployers are free to combine
supervisor training for alcohol misuse detection with the comparable training for drug use detection currently
required by the OA drug testing rules for a total of two hours to minimize costs and inconvenience.'' (59 FR 7334). The
Petitioners did not provide any justification for reducing the supervisory training to a total of one hour for both
drugs and alcohol, other than to suggest that ``much of the information *&blank;*&blank;* will overlap.'' (Jt. Pet.
at 11). Although some of the symptoms of drug and alcohol use may be similar, the symptoms vary widely depending on the
type and quantity of the substance ingested. Many commenters recommended that additional supervisory training
on alcohol misuse (more than one hour) be required, and many employers voluntarily offer recurrent or follow-up training
to ensure that supervisors have sufficient awareness of the indicators of alcohol and drug use. Therefore, RSPA is
retaining the requirement that operators must provide a minimum of one hour of supervisory training for drug use and
one hour for alcohol misuse, which may be combined into a single two-hour training period. Accordingly, no change
to the rule is necessary.

6. RSPA Should Clarify Its Position on Follow-Up Tests for Alcohol and Drugs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Petitioners state that the RSPA regulations in 49 CFR 199.225(d)(1) require follow-up alcohol tests in certain
situations, but do not address whether it is appropriate for a substance abuse professional (SAP) also to require
follow-up drug tests, when an individual also shows signs of drug abuse. The Petitioners point out that the Common
Preamble, however, indicates that the rules will permit an employer to conduct follow-up drug tests, if the SAP suspects
drug involvement. The Petitioners request that RSPA clarify that the authority in the Common Preamble also extends
to RSPA operators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
RSPA Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 RSPA is granting the Petitioners' request to clarify this issue. Section 199.225(d)(1) provides that follow-up
testing shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of &sect;199.243(b)(2)(ii). This reference is in error,
and should be to &sect;199.243(c)(2)(ii), which provides that follow-up testing may include testing for drugs,
as directed by the SAP, to be performed in accordance with 49 CFR part 40. RSPA is amending

&sect;199.225(d)(1) to include the correct reference.

7. RSPA Should Clarify That Companies Are Not Responsible for Ensuring Contractor Compliance With the Final Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Petitioners contend that operators should not be responsible for ensuring that contractors comply with the alcohol
misuse program. (Jt. Pet. at 11). The Petitioners contend that the monitoring responsibility for contractor employees
is highly impracticable and difficult to achieve, particularly for small operators who rely on many contractors,
and may enter into contracts at short notice. The Petitioners assert that there are practical problems in monitoring
transient workers, or in knowing which particular contract employees will perform certain jobs. The Petitioners
state that contractors ``are used predominantly for construction, and almost never for operations. Therefore,
it is difficult to envision circumstances where post-accident testing would be required for contractors.'' (Jt.
Pet. at 12). The Petitioners assert that ``for cause'' testing is also unnecessary, because currently when an operator
suspects a contractor employee is alcohol-impaired, the contractor is ordered to remove the employee. The Petitioners
therefore contend that requiring operators to oversee or manage a detailed alcohol compliance program for contractors
is an inefficient use of resources and an unnecessary burden, given that the only testing that is likely to be carried
out is ``for cause'' testing, which is already handled adequately by operator/contractor agreements.

RSPA Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 RSPA is denying the Petitioners' request. RSPA's longstanding and oft-stated position on this issue is that a pipeline
operator who chooses to perform safety-sensitive functions by using contractors is held responsible for compliance
with the Pipeline Safety Regulations just as if the operator's own employees were performing the work (54 FR 51747,
December 18, 1989; 57 FR 59714, December 15, 1992). The proper performance of a safety-sensitive function should
not be dependent on the individual's direct or indirect employment relationship with the operator. Furthermore,
the alcohol rules are limited to persons performing covered functions, i.e., operation, maintenance, and emergency
response functions that are regulated by 49 CFR parts 192, 193, or 195 and performed on a pipeline or liquefied natural
gas facility. Covered functions do not include clerical, truck driving, accounting, or other functions not covered
by parts 192, 193, or 195 (49 CFR 199.205).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Petitioners themselves note that contractors are used predominantly for construction (which generally is not
a covered function), are almost never used for operations, and, therefore, post-accident testing for contractors
would be rare. By this same reasoning, contractors would only rarely be subject to reasonable suspicion testing,
i.e., when performing covered functions. If the Petitioners are correct that few contractor employees will be performing
covered functions, then there should be a very minimal burden on operators. If a contractor does not perform covered
functions, then no operator monitoring will be required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In those instances where a contractor employee is performing a covered function, RSPA is not persuaded that the employee
should be removed, without a test, because the operator suspects that the employee is alcohol-impaired. If the operator
has the opportunity to observe the employee and determines that reasonable suspicion exists that the employee is
impaired, the employee must be tested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although an operator may choose, under &sect;199.245, to allow a contractor to carry out the required alcohol testing,
training, and education, the operator may find that it is simpler and more cost-effective to assume that responsibility
directly. Unlike random and pre-employment testing, which involve large numbers of tests, post-accident and reasonable
suspicion testing should result in relatively few tests. RSPA's experience with drug testing is that fewer than 3%
of the total tests conducted have been in post-accident and reasonable suspicion situations. Regardless of whether
it employs contractors, an operator must have an alcohol misuse plan, provide educational materials to its employees,
train supervisors, and be prepared to conduct tests. An operator could make copies of its educational materials available
to contractor employees, use trained supervisors to observe contractor employees who are performing safety-sensitive
functions, and test contractor employees in those few instances when testing is required. The arguments advanced
by the Petitioners do not demonstrate that the requirement to ensure contractor compliance with the alcohol rule
is unduly burdensome, impractical, or unnecessary. Therefore, RSPA is retaining the requirement that the operator
is responsible for ensuring that employees who perform covered functions for the operator, whether directly or by
contract, are subject to the requirements of the RSPA rule. Accordingly, no change to the rule is necessary.

RSPA Should Clarify That Operators May Continue To Remove an Employee Without Conducting a Test

The Petitioners state that many operators currently remove a safety-sensitive employee from the job, without performing
an alcohol test, who is suspected of being alcohol-impaired. The Petitioners urge RSPA to amend the final rule and
allow employers to continue this practice as long as the employee is made aware that the employer is relying on company
policy or a labor agreement and not the DOT regulations, for the authority to remove the employee. The Petitioners
contend that if the employee is not allowed to return to the job unless the other DOT requirements are met, such as evaluation
by a SAP and follow-up testing, then the operator should be permitted to remove an employee without performing an alcohol
test. The Petitioners suggested that, for reporting purposes, operators should be required to notify DOT of those
employees who were not tested, but nonetheless removed from the job, counseled in alcohol counseling programs, or
dismissed.

RSPA Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. RSPA is denying the Petitioners' request. Section 199.225(b) requires each operator to require an employee to submit
to an alcohol test when the operator has reasonable suspicion to believe that the employee has violated the prohibitions
in the alcohol misuse rule (e.g., has an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater, or has used alcohol while performing
covered functions). Section 199.225(b)(4)(ii) provides that, notwithstanding the absence of a reasonable suspicion
test, an operator shall not allow an employee to perform covered functions while the employee appears to be under the
influence of or impaired by alcohol, until eight hours have passed or the employee has been tested and has a result below
0.02. As discussed in the Common Preamble (59 FR 7328), an employer who observes an employee exhibiting the appearance
of alcohol misuse, must test that employee. However, ``when it is infeasible or impossible to conduct a reasonable
suspicion test in a timely manner (e.g., an EBT is unavailable or broken), the employee is not permitted to perform
safety-sensitive functions for eight hours (or until obtaining a result below 0.02 on a test if an EBT subsequently
becomes available within the 8-hour period).''

Section 199.225(b)(4)(iii) specifies that, except as provided in &sect;199.225(b)(4)(ii) (i.e., removal from
covered functions for eight hours or until a test result of below 0.02), ``no operator shall take any action under [the
RSPA alcohol misuse rule] against an employee based solely on the employee's behavior and appearance, in the absence
of an alcohol test. This does not prohibit an operator with the authority independent of this [rule] from taking any
action otherwise consistent with law.'' Under the RSPA rule, an operator is required to test an employee when the operator
has reason to believe the employee is under the influence of or impaired by alcohol, or has violated any other prohibition
in the RSPA rule. The operator may not simply remove the employee without conducting a test, unless conducting a test
is physically impossible because the employee is in a remote location or the only available EBT is broken. In such a
situation, where a test cannot be conducted, the operator must ensure that the employee does not perform any covered
functions for eight hours or until a test result of below 0.02 is obtained, whichever comes first. The operator may
take no other action against the employee under authority of the RSPA rule. If the operator wishes to take additional
action under its own authority, it may do so, but it must conduct reasonable suspicion testing in accordance with the
RSPA rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As explained in the preamble to the RSPA final rule (59 FR 7427), RSPA will monitor the data that we receive from post-accident
and reasonable suspicion tests to determine if further action is warranted. Alcohol misuse is a problem in society
generally, and it is reasonable to expect that the pipeline industry is not immune from that problem. Testing is vital
to determine the extent of any problem, and the resulting data is necessary to evaluate the alcohol misuse program
and develop more effective strategies for eliminating alcohol misuse. Accordingly, no change to the rule is necessary.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 23, 1992, the Wild Bird Conservation Act (WBCA) was signed into law, the purposes of which include promoting
the conservation of exotic birds by: ensuring that all imports into the United States of species of exotic birds are
biologically sustainable and not detrimental to the species; ensuring that imported birds are not subject to inhumane
treatment during capture and transport; and assisting wild bird conservation and management programs in countries
of origin. This final rule amends the final rule published by the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) on November 16,
1993, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 60524), which implements the prohibitions stipulated in the WBCA and provides permit requirements and procedures
for some allowed exemptions. As a result of a lawsuit filed on February 15, 1994 by the Humane Society of the United States
and Defenders of Wildlife, and a resultant District Court Order that declared a portion of the contested regulation
as invalid, the Service hereby amends 50 CFR 15.11 (b) and (c). Notice of the Court Order was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 24, 1994 (59 FR 26810). Consistent with that Court Order, the Service announced in that

(CITES) are covered by the automatic import moratorium of the WBCA, regardless of their country of origin.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the final rule of November 16, 1993, the Service interpreted that Appendix III species are considered CITES-listed
species for the purposes of these regulations only if they originate in the country that listed them in Appendix III.
The Service noted that the listing of a species in Appendix III is a unilateral action by a particular CITES Party, thereby
requiring CITES permits and implementation of CITES permit issuance requirements for that country only; when the
species is found in countries that did not list it in Appendix III, only a certificate of origin is required, stating
that it did not originate in the country that listed the species in Appendix III. Therefore, when the species is found
in countries other than where listed in Appendix III, it is not subject to the same level of CITES controls, and indeed
is only listed in the Appendices to assist the listing state in implementing its domestic legislation. Based on its
understanding of the intent of Congress, the Service implemented a final rule whereby Appendix III species were subject
to the automatic import prohibitions of the law, only if they originated in the listing country. Otherwise, they would
be subject to the discretionary prohibitions of the law.

Civ. No. 94&hyph;0296, D.D.C., March 29, 1994). A hearing in the District Court took place on March 7, 1994. Plaintiffs
argued that this provision, which was adopted through notice and comment procedures, violates the language of the
Wild Bird Conservation Act of 1992. They sought relief to suspend or invalidate the following exception, contained
in the final rule, to the prohibition on importation of birds listed in the Convention's appendices: ``This paragraph
(b) does not apply to an exotic bird species listed in Appendix III to the Convention that originated in a country that
has not listed the species in Appendix III'' (50 CFR 15.11 (b) (2)). Plaintiffs argued that this provision violates
the plain language of the Act, which bars the importation of ``any'' species listed in ``any'' appendix to the Convention.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 29, 1994, U.S. District Judge Louis F. Oberdorfer found the contested regulation to be invalid. [This Court
Order was discussed in a Notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 published on May 24, 1994.] Therefore, the Service hereby amends 50 CFR 15.11 (b) and (c) to comply with the Court Order.
The Service mandates that all bird species listed in CITES Appendix III (in addition to those in Appendices I or II),
wherever found, cannot be imported into the U.S. unless they are either accompanied by an import permit issued pursuant
to Subpart C of 50 CFR Part 15, or they are included in an approved list. On March 17, 1994, the Service published in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 12784) a proposed rule that would establish those approved lists. This final rule is a result of the Court Order
discussed in the Notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 24, 1994, and is adopted through public notice and comment procedures. Therefore, in accordance with 5 U.S.C.
553(d)(3), the Service has determined that good cause, as reflected by the final Court Order, exists so that this final
rule will be made effective upon publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Service received a total of three comments on the proposed rule preceding this final rule that was published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on June 3, 1994 (59 FR 28826). One commenter endorsed the proposed ruling. One commenter supported the original interpretation
by the Service in the WBCA of birds listed in CITES Appendix III, and inquired as to why the Service did not appeal the
decision rendered in the Court Order. The decision not to appeal was made by the Service, the Solicitor's Office, and
the Justice Department after careful deliberation over the legal, policy, and budgetary implications of continued
litigation. The remaining commenter addressed concerns that though valid, were not pertinent to the contents of
the proposed rule.

Effects of the Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service has determined that this final rule is categorically excluded under Departmental procedures in complying
with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). See DOI Departmental Manual, 516 DM 2, Appendix 1, 1.10. The regulations
are procedural in nature, and the environmental effects are judged to be minimal, speculative, and do not lend themselves
to meaningful analysis. The permits and other administrative actions authorized under the WBCA and regulations
will be subject to future NEPA documentation requirements, on a case-by-case basis.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866. This action
would not be expected to have significant taking implications for U.S. citizens, as per Executive Order 12630. Any
effects on small entities (importers, shippers, etc.) would likely be minor, and would in any event be the mandatory
result of the district court ruling. Future final rulemaking will establish procedures for listing of species approved
for import, which may reduce any effects on small entities. No reporting requirements would be added to existing regulations.
Therefore, this revision would not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities as
described by the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Since this final rule applies to importation of live exotic birds into
the United States, it does not contain any Federalism impacts as described in Executive Order 12612. The Department
has certified that this rule meets the applicable standards provided in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order
12778.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On October 23, 1992, the Wild Bird Conservation Act of 1992 (WBCA) was signed into law, the purposes of which include
promoting the conservation of exotic birds by: Ensuring that all imports of exotic bird species into the United States
are biologically sustainable and not detrimental to the species; ensuring that imported birds are not subject to
inhumane treatment during capture and transport; and assisting wild bird conservation and management programs
in countries of origin. This final rule implements procedures for the establishment of an approved list of species
listed in the Appendices to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora that
may be imported without a WBCA permit because it has been determined that trade in these species involves only captive-bred
specimens.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule implements aspects of the WBCA, which was signed into law on October 23, 1992. This is the second of two
rulemakings under the WBCA; the first final rulemaking under the WBCA was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 16, 1993 (58 FR 60524). The WBCA limits or prohibits imports of exotic bird species to ensure that their
wild populations are not harmed by trade. It also encourages wild bird conservation programs in countries of origin
by both ensuring that all imports of such species into the United States are biologically sustainable and not detrimental
to the species, and by creating an Exotic Bird Conservation Fund to provide conservation assistance in countries
of origin. The final rule of November 16, 1993, summarized the effects of the WBCA and established procedures for obtaining
import permits authorized by the WBCA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An immediate moratorium, effective October 23, 1992, was established on the importation of 10 species of wild birds
of particular concern that were listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species
of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES, or Convention), two of which were moved to Appendix I at the March 1992 CITES meeting.
The prohibition on importation of those species was announced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 4, 1992 (57 FR 57510). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the one-year period immediately following enactment of the WBCA, from October 23, 1992, to October 22, 1993,
import quotas were established for CITES-listed bird species. Those quotas were announced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 4, 1992 (57 FR 57510). A notice published on March 30, 1993 (58 FR 16644), solicited public comments and
announced a public meeting, held April 15&hyph;16, 1993, to receive input from the public for the development of regulations
to implement some of the provisions of the WBCA. Useful input was received from a broad cross-section of interested
members of the public who participated in the meeting and submitted comments in writing; that input has been used to
develop this final rule. A notice published on April 16, 1993 (58 FR 19840), announced species for which the quotas
had been met and no further individual birds could be imported. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the publication of the final rule of November 16, 1993, imports of all CITES-listed birds (as defined in the final
rule) are prohibited, except for (a) species included in an approved list; (b) specimens for which an import permit
has been issued; (c) species from countries that have approved management plans for those species; or (d) specimens
from approved foreign captive-breeding facilities. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) published a proposed
rule in the

FR 12784), that would implement procedures for approval of foreign captive-breeding facilities and establishment
of an approved list of species listed in the CITES Appendices that can be imported without a WBCA permit; that approved
list is published herein. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of a lawsuit filed on February 15, 1994, by the Humane Society of the United States and Defenders of Wildlife,
and a resultant District Court Order that found a portion of the regulation in the November 16, 1993, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 60524) invalid, the Service, consistent with that Court Order, announced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 24, 1994 (59 FR 26810), that all exotic birds listed in Appendix III of CITES are covered by the automatic import
moratorium of the WBCA, regardless of their country of origin. A proposed rule was published on June 3, 1994 (59 FR 28826),
to promulgate that regulatory change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule finalizes those proposals made in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

and further analysis by the Service. The proposed regulations for the approval of foreign breeding facilities and
the approved list for wild-caught CITES-listed species will be addressed in a future final rulemaking.

The Service received roughly 4800 comments from the public, including over 4600 form letters from private aviculturists
(bird breeders) and comments from 6 conservation and/or animal welfare organizations, 1 zoological organization,
2 scientific organizations, 1 representative of the pet industry, 2 private companies, 3 importers, 11 avicultural
organizations, and 6 falconry/raptor breeder organizations; the remaining comments were from other private individuals.

Comments of a General Nature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters, including a scientific organization, several conservation organizations, a zoological organization,
an avicultural organization, and some private individuals, supported the criteria for listing species on the approved
list of captive-bred species and the proposed list of captive-bred species in their entirety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Numerous comments contended that the proposed list of approved captive-bred species was too restrictive and allowed
for the captive breeding of only those species on the approved list. The Service is aware that the proposed list of approved
captive-bred species has caused misunderstanding and confusion in the avicultural community and wishes to clarify
what the WBCA and the approved list for captive-bred species actually regulates. Neither the Wild Bird Conservation
Act nor the Service's regulations implementing Section 106 of the Act impose new burdens or requirements on buying,
selling, breeding, transport, interstate commerce, or export of birds bred in the United States. Those activities
are not regulated by the WBCA. What the WBCA does is to restrict imports of bird species listed in the CITES Appendices,
whether taken from the wild or bred in captivity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Species listed on the approved list of captive-bred species are those species that can be imported into the United
States without a WBCA permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This approved list of captive-bred species does not regulate the breeding, selling, transport, interstate commerce,
or export of birds bred in the United States. Several commenters were under the false impression that, if a species
is not on the approved list of captive-bred species, this species could not be possessed or bred in the United States.
The Service encourages such captive breeding within the United States to meet the commercial demand for pet birds.
The Service also notes that the approved list of captive-bred species only means that the species is approved for import
without a WBCA permit; it does not mean that the Service does not approve the breeding of other species. The Service
is in the process of working to ease the bird breeding public's concerns by initiating a program of public education
on the WBCA and its regulations.

Comments Pertaining to Section 15.31: Criteria for Including Species in the Approved List for Captive-Bred Species

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section establishes the criteria for the inclusion of captive-bred species in the approved list. Pursuant to
Section 106 of the WBCA, the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) is required to publish a list of species of exotic
birds that are listed in an appendix to the Convention and that are not subject to a prohibition or suspension of importation
otherwise applicable under the WBCA. In order to list a species as exclusively captive-bred, the Service is required
by the statute to determine that the species is regularly bred in captivity and that no wild-caught birds of the species
are in trade, legally or illegally. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These captive-bred species can be imported into the United States without meeting any additional requirements of
the Wild Bird Conservation Act or this Part 15; however, all of the existing requirements in Parts 13 and 14, Part 17
(species listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act (ESA)), Part 21 (Migratory Bird Treaty
Act), and Part 23 (species listed in the Appendices to the Convention, or CITES) must still be complied with. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This section establishes the following criteria for the approval of the importation of captive-bred species: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a species is bred in captivity in large numbers, but individual birds of that species are frequently, sometimes,
or even rarely taken from the wild, or if there are enforcement concerns that illegal trade occurs in the species, the
statute does not allow that species to be included as a captive-bred species. However, individual captive-bred birds
may still be imported into the United States under one of the following conditions: (1) the foreign breeding facility
could be approved pursuant to Subpart E of this Part 15; or (2) a permit for an individual import could be obtained pursuant
to Subpart C, if the requirements of that Subpart are met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As established in the WBCA, the Service will periodically review the list of species that meet the approval criteria
for the importation of captive-bred species. Any changes [additions and/or deletions] to this approved list will
be proposed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for public comment, followed by a final rule in which the proposed changes will be made or an explanation provided for
not making them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Numerous commenters, including 762 form letters from aviculturists, requested that all captive-bred birds be exempted
from the WBCA and its implementing regulations. The Service disagrees, since that is not allowed by the statute. One
of the purposes of the WBCA is to assist wild bird conservation and management in the countries of origin. However,
except for the 10 bird families specifically exempted from the WBCA, the WBCA applies to all species of exotic birds
being exported from any country, whether individual birds are of captive or wild origin. In passing the WBCA, Congress
recognized that there are serious concerns that wild-caught birds are often intentionally misrepresented as captive-bred.
For this reason, the law specifies criteria for the import of captive-bred species; it does not simply exempt them.
Furthermore, the Service is aware of illegal trade whereby wild-caught birds are misrepresented as captive-bred
and laundered as captive-bred birds. Therefore, it would be inconsistent with both the plain language and intent
of the statute to exempt entirely all birds that are claimed to be bred in captivity from the provisions of the law. However,
the Service notes that, in addition to the list of approved captive-bred species, several other ways exist to import
captive-bred birds into the United States under the WBCA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Numerous commenters objected to the Service's use of the standards adopted by the State of New York with respect to
establishing the criteria for including species in the approved list for captive-bred species, and commented that
such standards were too restrictive. The Service disagrees. The Service was advised to adopt such standards by the
House of Representatives Committee Report for the WBCA. The House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee advised
the Service ``to use the standards adopted by the State of New York with respect to importation of captive-bred species,
and include such species on the approved list under this section, as long as the Secretary believes that trade based
on these standards will not result in harm to species in the wild'' [House Report No. 102&hyph;749 (I) pages 1602&hyph;1603].
These standards would include species of exotic birds in the approved list if the species is regularly bred in captivity
and none are taken from the wild for trade. Many commenters stated that many more species are bred in captivity than
occur on the New York State Approved List of Captive-bred Species and that this list was adopted years ago when avicultural
techniques were not as developed as they are today. The Service agrees that many more species are bred in captivity
now than when New York State developed its regulations and approved list. The Service has adopted the standards used
by New York State in developing its criteria for the approval of captive-bred species, and has included many species
that are not found on the New York State approved list of captive-bred species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Animal welfare organizations and one conservation organization supported the criteria for including species on
the approved list of captive-bred species, but requested that additional criteria be added to conform to CITES requirements
for the humane transport of live animals. They requested that species experiencing 10% or higher mortality in transit
or 15% or higher mortality in quarantine not be included on the approved list of captive-bred species. Although the
Service is concerned about the humane treatment and transport of all birds, it disagrees that such criteria are required
for including species on the approved list of captive-bred species. The Service implements requirements for the
humane and healthful transport of live birds imported into the United States through its implementation of the Lacey
Act humane and healthful transport requirements, found in 50 CFR Part 14. In including species on the approved list
of captive-bred species, the Service is required to determine that the species is regularly bred in captivity and
no wild-caught birds of the species are in trade, legally or illegally. The Service notes as well that mortalities
in shipments of birds that are bred in captivity tend to be lower than those of wild-caught birds.

Several aviculturists commented that the approved list of captive-bred species should include species where captive
breeding of the species is needed to conserve the species. The Service recognizes the contribution that captive breeding
may make to the conservation of some species, but the statute does not instruct the Secretary to list a species on the
approved list of captive-bred species using such criteria. If an ex-situ captive-breeding program is needed for
a species' conservation, wild-caught or captive-bred birds may be imported from approved overseas breeding facilities,
from countries with approved management plans, and for scientific research, zoological breeding, and approved
cooperative breeding programs under WBCA permits available from the Service. The Service notes that cooperative
breeding programs encourage such conservation efforts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several aviculturists commented that the approved list of captive-bred species would cause a loss of genetic diversity
in captive populations of birds in the U.S. and restrict access to new bloodlines for a species' conservation. The
Service disagrees and notes that birds which are not on the approved list of captive-bred species may still be imported
into the U.S. under the WBCA in several other ways: from approved overseas breeding facilities, from countries with
approved management plans, and for scientific research, zoological breeding, and approved cooperative breeding
programs. Congress included the exemptions for zoological breeding and cooperative breeding programs for just
this purpose. The Service notes that it is not the intent of approval of captive-bred species to enhance conservation
of a species, but rather to facilitate imports of specimens that in no way impact wild populations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Numerous aviculturists (including 2318 represented by form letters), a representative of the pet industry, avicultural
groups, and several importers commented that any species that is regularly captive-bred, and that is prohibited
from export for the pet trade by its country of origin, should be listed on the approved list of captive-bred species
(regardless of enforcement concerns). For example, they recommend that all species which are regularly bred in captivity
and are indigenous solely to Australia, a country from which there is no legal avian trade in wild-caught birds, should
be listed on the approved list of captive-bred species. The Service disagrees. There remain problems in adequate
regulatory and enforcement mechanisms in many countries of origin for species which are subject to illegal trade.
Adoption of this recommendation would lead to the logically absurd conclusion to list all indigenous parrots of Mexico
on the approved list of captive-bred species because Mexico bans their export. Since there exists a flourishing domestic
trade in wild-caught parrots in Mexico and their subsequent illegal export to the U.S., such inclusion on the approved
list would undermine species conservation, as well as Mexico's enforcement efforts. We cannot adopt this recommendation,
which is counter to the purpose of the statute and the intent of Congress.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several aviculturists, some importers, and a raptor breeders' organization commented that species should be listed
on the approved list of captive-bred species, on a country-by-country basis, if they are reliably bred in captivity
in a specific country only. For example, Saker falcons from Great Britain would be listed on the approved list of captive-bred
species because they are reliably captive-bred in Great Britain. The Service disagrees and is making no changes based
on these comments. The statute does not provide for species listings in such a country-by-country manner. However,
the qualifying overseas breeding facilities can be listed by the country from which the species is to be imported.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The representative of the pet industry and a national avicultural organization objected to Section 15.31 (a) stating
that it is inappropriate for the Service to require that all specimens of the species known to be in trade (legal or illegal)
be captive-bred. They consider trade to be legal trade only and that illegal trade should not be considered to be trade.
They recommend that the Service not take illegal trade into consideration. The Service strongly disagrees and recognizes
that it was Congress' intent to prevent the illegal trade in birds, which is detrimental to species' survival, and
the laundering of wild-caught birds as captive-bred specimens. The Service notes that, for any species, trade includes
both legal and illegal trade. Article I of the CITES Convention defines trade as ``export, re-export, import and introduction
from the sea'' and does not differentiate legal from illegal. For the purposes of implementing this law, the Service
agrees with the authors of the CITES Convention, as well as the reality of international trade, that trade has both
legal and illegal components.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service originally proposed that Section 15.31 (b) read ``no specimens of the species can be known to be removed
from the wild for the pet bird market.'' In its review of the comments, the Service noted that several commenters were
confused by this wording and the Service has changed Section 15.31 (b) to read ``no specimens of the species can be known
to be removed from the wild for commercial purposes.'' If in the future wild-caught specimens are imported to the U.S.
for the exemptions allowed under the WBCA for scientific research, zoological breeding or display, personal pets,
or approved cooperative breeding programs, such importations would not preclude listing the species in the approved
list of captive-bred species when the species is reliably bred in captivity and all specimens imported for commercial
purposes are captive-bred. Commercial purposes includes but is not limited to the pet market (it also includes travelling
animal acts, circuses, and other uses which result in financial benefit).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The representative of the pet industry and a national avicultural organization objected to Section 15.31 (c) stating
that ``inasmuch as the listing process requires that no wild-caught specimens are in trade, there is no necessity
even to address the non-detriment issue'' and that such a requirement is beyond the scope of the WBCA. The Service disagrees.
One of the stated purposes of the WBCA is to ensure that all trade in species of exotic birds involving the U.S. is biologically
sustainable and is not detrimental to the species. The WBCA requires the Service to make such a finding before listing
species on the approved list of captive-bred species. The Service was also advised to adopt such standards by the House
of Representatives Committee Report for the WBCA. In this Committee Report, the Secretary was advised ``to use the
standards adopted by the State of New York with respect to importation of captive-bred species, and include such species
on the approved list under this section, as long as the Secretary believes that trade based on these standards will
not result in harm to species in the wild'' [House Report No. 102&hyph;749 (I) pages 1602&hyph;1603].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the Service believes that if the inclusion of any species on an approved list could be detrimental to
the survival of the species in the wild, the intent of Congress, the purposes of the WBCA and the ``non-detriment''
requirements of CITES for Appendix II species are such that the species should not be included in the approved list.
The Service cannot list a species in the approved list if such listing could undermine the conservation of wild bird
species in the wild. Therefore, the Service is making no changes based on these comments.

Several aviculturists and one conservation organization expressed confusion over Section 15.31 (d). They note
that adequate enforcement controls should be in place in countries of export of captive-bred birds, as well as in countries
of origin of the wild populations. The Service agrees and notes that it is just as critical that enforcement be in place
and adequate in range countries as it be in place in exporting countries. The Service notes that adequate enforcement
in exporting countries is critical to ensure that wild-caught birds will not be misrepresented and laundered as captive-bred
birds. Adequate enforcement is critical to implementation of CITES, a specified purpose of the WBCA. Therefore,
the Service has modified 15.31 (d) accordingly.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section establishes a list of approved captive-bred species, based on the criteria in Section 15.31. The Service
used the best information available, including records of imports into the United States of both wild-caught and
captive-bred birds for the years 1988&hyph;1992, CITES annual reports, published reports on the bird trade, law
enforcement data on the commercial trade in captive-bred species, law enforcement and intelligence information
on the illegal trade in exotic bird species, information from the CITES Secretariat, and information from other governments.
The final list of approved species includes 45 captive-bred exotic bird species and the color mutations for 3 captive-bred
species that can be imported from any other country without a WBCA permit; other applicable requirements still apply,
including any permits or documents required by CITES, other federal laws, and the exporting country. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has included in the approved list of captive-bred species several exotic bird species that are not listed
in any Appendix to the Convention but are regularly bred in captivity and are not taken from the wild. Although these
species are not listed in an Appendix and thus are not presently prohibited under the WBCA, these species are included
in the list for the convenience of the public. If any of these species were to become listed in CITES Appendix I, II, or
III, their importation would remain exempt from the provisions of the WBCA, pursuant to this section. To ensure that
there is no confusion, even if the species or higher taxon to which it belongs were subsequently listed in the Appendices
to the Convention, the Service would still consider it to be an approved captive-bred species pursuant to this subpart
D. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters supported the approved list of captive-bred species published in the March 17, 1994

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice, whereas numerous commenters suggested specific additions of parrot and finch species to the approved list.
The Service reviewed information available to it for all of these species, based on the criteria in Section 15.31.
These comments are addressed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several falconry/raptor breeder organizations commented that all birds in the order Falconiformes should be exempted
from the WBCA and its implementing regulations. The Service disagrees and cannot exempt entire families of birds
that Congress did not choose to exempt. Except for the 10 bird families specifically exempted by the WBCA, the WBCA
applies to all species of exotic birds being exported from any country, whether individual birds are of captive or
wild origin. However, the Service notes that raptors can be imported into the United States in several ways, including
under permit requirements for scientific research, cooperative breeding programs, or zoological display or breeding.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters expressed concerns that once this list of approved captive-bred species is published, no additional
species could be added to the list. That is not the case. As new information becomes available, and as captive breeding
becomes more successful, the Service may propose modifications to this list of approved captive-bred species, including
the inclusion of additional species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some of the species recommended by several commenters for inclusion in the list of approved captive-bred species
are very rare in aviculture, and there are few records of their international trade, either in the United States or
elsewhere. The Service has not included such species in the approved list, and notes that a purpose of the list of approved
captive-bred species is to facilitate commercial importation of captive-bred species, whose trade in no way can
be detrimental to populations of these species in the wild. The fundamental purpose of the WBCA is conservation of
exotic bird species in the wild. For species that are rare in aviculture, individual captive-bred birds may be imported
for approved cooperative breeding programs, zoological breeding and display, or scientific research, pursuant
to Subpart C of this part.

For the above species, there are either no records or very few records of any specimens in trade. The Service was therefore
not able to make the determination required by the statute that the above species are regularly bred in captivity and
that the importation of specimens of the species is not detrimental to the species survival in the wild. The Service
recognizes that with increased captive breeding efforts for these species, they may be able to meet criteria for approval
in &sect;15.31 in the future.

Illegal trade in lanner falcons and saker falcons was reported in the Review of Alleged Infractions and Other Problems
of Implementation of the Convention (Doc. 9.22), which is a document prepared by the CITES Secretariat for discussion
at the Ninth Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to CITES. These species appear to be involved in illegal trade
on a fairly regular basis, including the laundering of wild-caught specimens through captive-breeding operations.

The Service received 1708 form letters requesting that all cockatoo species from Australia be added to the approved
list of captive-bred species. The Service disagrees, because all cockatoo species do not meet the criteria for approval
in &sect;15.31 due to the illegal trade in wild-caught birds from Australia. A recent three-year covert law enforcement
investigation, dubbed Operation Renegade, found that over a 10-year period individuals were hired as couriers and
travelled to Australia each fall during the cockatoo nesting season to remove eggs from nests in the wild. Several
hundred smuggled eggs were then incubated, hand-reared, and sold as captive-bred birds to collectors in the United
States. Among the smuggled species were Rose-breasted cockatoos, Red-tailed black cockatoos, Major Mitchell's
cockatoos, and Slender-billed corellas. This investigation was a joint effort with law enforcement officials from
Australia, New Zealand, and the United States, and to date, has resulted in criminal convictions against 17 individuals.

Several commenters requested that color mutations of several psittacine species be added to the approved list of
captive-bred species. The Service agrees when the color mutation is (a) rare or non-existent in the wild, and therefore
not likely to be obtained as wild-caught stock; (b) regularly produced in captivity, and (c) distinguishable from
the typical wild form and such ability to distinguish the color mutation is easy for the non-expert. Therefore, the
Service is adding the following color mutations for selected species to the approved list of captive-bred species:
Pacific parrotlet (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Forpus coelestis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) - lutino, yellow, blue and cinnamon forms; lineolated or barred parakeet (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Bolborhynchus lineola
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) - blue, yellow, and white forms; and Alexandrine parakeet (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Psittacula eupatria
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) - blue and lutino forms. The Service understands that newly discovered color mutations are continuously appearing
and being established in captivity, and would appreciate information as the process occurs, so that additional color
mutations could be listed on the approved list of captive-bred species.

Animal welfare organizations and one conservation organization commented that Peach-faced lovebird (

Psittacula cyanocephala

) do not meet the criteria for approval in &sect;15.31(a) and wild-caught birds are in trade. The Service has reviewed
its own and international import trade records for Peach-faced lovebirds and is satisfied that all specimens of the
species known to be in trade are captive-bred. The commenters expressed concern that imports of Peach-faced lovebirds
from South Africa could be wild-caught birds, since the species occurs in the wild there. The Service reviewed the
wildlife import declarations for all Peach-faced lovebirds imported from South Africa to the U.S. from 1988 through
1992 and is satisfied that the birds imported were captive-bred. Virtually all shipments had been certified by the
South African CITES Management Authority as captive-bred. This species meets the criteria for approval in &sect;15.31
and will remain on the approved list of captive-bred species.

The Service has reviewed import trade records for Plum-headed parakeets and found wild-caught specimens of this

of captive-bred species.

The Government of Australia communicated its concern with listing in the approved list of captive-bred species the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Psephotus haematogaster
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). They stated that these species are not common in captivity in Australia and that there are problems associated with
the smuggling of wild-caught specimens of these species. The Service proposed these species for listing in its March
17, 1994, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, based on the information available to it at that time, which showed that specimens
imported into the U.S. were captive-bred. Given this new information from Australia, the Service agrees and is not
including these species in the final list of approved captive-bred species.

Animal welfare organizations and one conservation organization recommended that the Gouldian finch (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Poephila bichenovii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) be deleted from the approved list of captive-bred species because of the high mortality these species suffer in transit
and quarantine. Although the Service recognizes the problems with mortality of birds in trade, the statute does not
allow the use of such information in listing captive-bred species on the approved list. The Service is committed,
however, to enforcement of the Humane and Healthful Transport Regulations in 50 CFR Part 14, which apply to these and
all other bird species imported into the United States.

The representative of the pet industry and two aviculturists commented it was ``in error and misleading'' for the
Service to list Bourke's parrot (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Neophema bourkii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and the Scarlet-chested parrot (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Neophema splendida
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) on the approved list of captive-bred species because they are listed as endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species
Act (ESA). The Service disagrees and notes that we are aware of the species' listing under the ESA. The Service did not
intend to mislead the public and was aware that these species were listed under the ESA and would require ESA permits
to be imported. However, the Service found that these 2 species met the criteria in Section 15.31, and since a few captive-bred
birds had been imported into the U.S. in past years, it was appropriate to list them and not require a WBCA permit for
their import. The Service notes that, although the species is endangered in the wild in Australia, adequate enforcement
controls exist such that wild-caught birds are not threatened by illegal trade. The Service does not have any evidence
of any specimens in international trade that are not captive-bred. The Government of Australia agrees with this interpretation
for these species. The Service has footnoted the species on the approved list of captive-bred species which require
an ESA permit for importation to avoid any confusion.

Effects of the Rule

The Service has determined that this final rule is categorically excluded under Departmental procedures in complying
with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). See 516 DM [Departmental Manual] 2, Appendix 1 Paragraph 1.10.
The regulations are procedural in nature, and the environmental effects, while crafted to carry out the benign purposes
of the WBCA, are judged to be minimal, speculative, and do not lend themselves to meaningful analysis. Future regulations
implementing the WBCA may be subject to NEPA documentation requirements, on a case-by-case basis.

This rule was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866. This action is not
expected to have significant taking implications for United States citizens, as per Executive Order No. 12630. It
has also been certified that these revisions will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of
small entities as described by the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Since the rule applies to importation of live wild
birds into the United States, it does not contain any Federalism impacts as described in Executive Order 12612.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Personnel Management is issuing final regulations on the use and recredit of sick leave for Federal employees.
Consistent with the recently enacted Federal Employees Family Friendly Leave Act, the final regulations expand
the use of sick leave by permitting most employees to use a total of up to 104 hours of sick leave each leave year (or, in
the case of a part-time employee or an employee with an uncommon tour of duty, the number of hours of sick leave normally
accrued during a leave year) to provide care for a family member as a result of physical or mental illness; injury; pregnancy;
childbirth; or medical, dental, or optical examination or treatment; or to make arrangements necessitated by the
death of a family member or attend the funeral of a family member. The final regulations also remove the 3-year break-in-service
limitation on the recredit of sick leave for former employees who are reemployed on or after December 2, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 11, 1994 (59 FR 24560), the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) published proposed regulations to amend 5 CFR
630.401 to provide that employees may use a total of up to 5 days of sick leave per leave year to provide care for a child,
spouse, or parent as a result of sickness, injury, pregnancy, or childbirth; to make arrangements necessitated by
the death of a family member; or to attend the funeral of a family member. In addition, OPM proposed to amend 5 CFR 630.502
and 630.504 to remove the 3-year brake-in-service limitation on the recredit of sick leave and permit employees who
separate from Federal service to have their unused sick leave recredited in full to their sick leave accounts upon
return to Federal service on or after the effective date of the final regulations. These changes were recommended
in the Report of the National Performance Review on September 7, 1993. The proposed regulations also included conforming
changes in &sect;&sect;630.402 (Application for sick leave), 630.403 (Supporting evidence), and 630.405 (Use
of sick leave during annual leave).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the comment period, OPM received comments from 1 Member of Congress, 29 Federal agencies, 1 labor organization,
13 professional organizations and associations, and 99 individuals, for a total of 143 comments. Thirty-four commenters
supported the proposed revisions in the sick leave regulations without change. Five individuals opposed the proposed
sick leave regulations. These individuals believed sick leave should be granted only for an employee's personal
illness or injury and that Federal employees earn and accrue sufficient annual leave to provide care for family members.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the close of the comment period, Congress passed and the President signed into law the Federal Employees Family
Friendly Leave Act, Public Law 103&hyph;388, on October 22, 1994. The Act authorizes the use by all covered full-time
employees of a total of up to 40 hours (5 workdays) of sick leave per year to (1) give care or otherwise attend to a family
member having an illness, injury, or other condition which, if an employee had such a condition, would justify the
use of sick leave by the employee; or (2) make arrangements or attend the funeral of a family member. In addition, a covered
full-time employee who maintains a balance of at least 80 hours of sick leave may use an additional 64 hours (8 workdays)
of sick leave per year for these purposes, bringing the total amount of sick leave available for family care and bereavement
purposes to a maximum of 104 hours (13 workdays) per year for employees who satisfy this condition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal Employees Family Friendly Leave Act will become effective on December 22, 1994. As discussed below, however,
we have determined that regulatory provisions consistent with the entitlements provided by this legislation should
be made effective immediately under the regulatory authority granted to OPM by the current sick leave statute (5 U.S.C.
6311).

A summary of the comments received by OPM on the proposed sick leave regulations and a description of the revisions
made in the regulations as a result of the comments are presented below.

Use of Sick Leave To Care for Family Members
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A large proportion of the commenters (65) opposed limiting the use of sick leave to provide care only for certain family
members_i.e., a child, spouse, or parent. The commenters believed the proposed rule was unfair and discriminatory
to many Federal employees who share close family responsibilities in a family group broader than a traditional nuclear
family. Further, they suggested this policy would be inconsistent with the intent of many other OPM initiatives designed
to assist Federal employees in balancing work and family needs. For example, one agency suggested that if the purpose
of the proposed sick leave regulations is to be sensitive to the needs of all employees, some consideration should
be given to those individuals who have legal responsibility for other family members or significant others. One commenter
recommended that OPM's definition of family member be changed so that the Federal Government could set an example
as an employer of a diverse workforce. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One agency and 11 individuals recommended that the phrase ``son or daughter'' be substituted for the term ``child.''
The definition of ``child'' in the proposed rule includes individuals over the age of 18 only if they are disabled.
The agency was concerned that the term ``child'' may be perceived as connoting a lack of maturity and suggested that
this connotation is not appropriate to individuals over 18 who are disabled because it may reinforce negative stereotypes
about individuals with disabilities. The agency stated that the phrase ``son or daughter,'' as used in the Family
and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) and in OPM's implementing regulations under the Act, is less likely to connote
immaturity, since the phrase identifies the relationship rather than a stage of development. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters pointed out that the definition of ``child'' in the proposed rule would prohibit parents from using
sick leave to arrange for or attend the funeral of an adult son or daughter who is over 18 years old and is not disabled.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One agency noted that some agencies provide broader coverage for benefits under the FMLA by allowing additional family
members to be covered (as encouraged in OPM's interim regulations implementing Title II of the FMLA) and that these
agencies will be put in the awkward position of having different coverage for two leave programs that OPM recognizes
as having a ``similarity of purpose.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most of the commenters recommended that OPM use the broader definition of ``family member'' found in the Voluntary
Leave Transfer Program. One commenter noted that this definition is more accommodating to the needs of a wide variety
of family compositions. Another suggested that the broader definition would more faithfully fulfill the Federal
Government's purpose of being a responsive, competitive, and model employer. One agency noted that the broader definition
is consistent with the intent of the National Performance Review recommendations. Furthermore, the agency noted
that the broader definition recognizes that in today's society there are both traditional and nontraditional families
and that the responsibilities placed on the employee are the same in both cases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to these comments and consistent with the requirements of the Federal Employees Family Friendly Leave
Act, the final regulations include the broader definition of ``family member'' that is used in the Federal leave sharing
program. For these purposes, ``family member'' means (a) spouse and parents thereof; (b) children, including adopted
children, and spouses thereof; (c) parents; (d) brother and sisters, and spouses thereof; and (e) any individual
related by blood or affinity whose close association with the employee is the equivalent of a family relationship.
The term ``children, including adopted children, and spouses thereof,'' as used in this definition, covers adult
sons and daughters, whether disabled or not, and therefore permits an employee to use sick leave to arrange for or attend
the funeral of an adult son or daughter who is over 18 years old and is not disabled.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A significant number of the commenters (42) opposed OPM's proposed 5-day limitation on the amount of sick leave to
be used each leave year for family care or bereavement purposes. One commenter questioned whether 5 days of sick leave
each leave year realistically would be sufficient to enable an employee to provide care for family members, especially
in situations of terminal or serious illness. One commenter stated that the current move to ``empower'' employees
assumes that employees are able to exercise good judgment about their jobs. Therefore, it was suggested, OPM should
assume that employees can make a fair judgment about their own usage of leave. One agency commented that if the absence
represents an appropriate use of sick leave, the amount should be determined by the circumstances of each case, not
by an arbitrary ceiling.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A professional association commented that the proposed 5-day limit on the use of sick leave to care for a family member
is unnecessary and too restrictive and that it contravenes the FMLA, which imposes no such limit. The association
believes the FMLA already permits Federal employees to substitute their accrued or accumulated sick leave for any
or all of the 12 weeks of unpaid FMLA leave to care for a family member. Under 5 U.S.C. 6382(d), an employee may elect to
substitute paid accrued or accumulated annual or sick leave for any part of the 12-week period of FMLA leave, ``except
that nothing in this subchapter shall require an employing agency to provide paid sick leave in any situation in which
such employer would not normally provide any such paid leave.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The association believes the legislative history of the FMLA shows that Congress intended that employees would be
entitled to unlimited substitution of sick leave for unpaid leave provided by the FMLA. The association raised these
same objections in its comments to the Department of Labor (DOL) on its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (58 FR 13394,
March 10, 1993) requesting assistance in developing interim regulations implementing Title I of the FMLA and to OPM
on its interim regulations implementing Title II of the FMLA (58 FR 39596, July 23, 1993). The association further
stated that since OPM has not yet issued final regulations on the FMLA and has not resolved the issue of substitution
of sick leave, it is premature for OPM to promulgate a sick leave rule that may contradict OPM's final FMLA regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOL addressed the professional association's objections in its interim regulations implementing Title I of the
FMLA in 29 CFR part 825 (58 FR 31794, June 4, 1993). DOL stated that ``the history of this provision lacks an explanation
that it is so intended and cannot, therefore, overcome the clearer reading of the statutory language.'' OPM agrees
with DOL's assessment that the legislative history does not support the idea that Congress intended unlimited substitution
of paid sick leave for FMLA leave without pay. In addition, &sect;630.1205(b)(1) of OPM's interim regulations implementing
Title II of the FMLA specifically states that an employee may elect to substitute annual or sick leave for unpaid FMLA
leave, ``consistent with current law and regulations governing the granting and use of annual and sick leave.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most of the agencies commenting on the 5-day limitation suggested that OPM impose no limit on the amount of sick leave
that an employee may use to provide care for an ill or injured family member. Two agencies recommended that, because
of the similarity of purpose between this initiative and the Family and Medical Leave Act, the sick leave regulations
should be amended to permit employees to substitute sick leave for any or all of the 12 weeks of unpaid leave provided
by the FMLA. One agency noted that by aligning the sick leave regulations with the FMLA, OPM could reduce the need for
another set of tracking systems covering time off to care for family members. Several agencies reported that tracking
and monitoring the proposed 5-day limit would impose an additional administrative burden on their payroll and timekeeping
functions because they would be required to track two types of sick leave_sick leave used for the employee's own medical
needs and sick leave used for family needs. One agency stated that the potential for abuse appears high, since an employer
may have difficulty verifying the medical status of family members.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A professional organization stated that limiting the use of sick leave to 5 days per year for family care or bereavement
purposes is both inadequate and impractical to administer and would send a mixed message to Federal employees that
family-friendly programs are encouraged but only minimally supported. The organization objected to what it characterized
as OPM's patronizing tone in expressing a need to exercise caution in making changes in the sick leave regulations
that might allow for abuse or harm the employee's ability to save enough sick leave for his or her own personal use. The
organization suggested that employees should be viewed as fully responsible for accommodating their own personal
and family needs and recommended allowing employees to use an unlimited amount of sick leave for family care purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, the Federal Employees Family Friendly Leave Act establishes a maximum limitation of 104 hours (13
workdays) of sick leave that may be used by most employees to care for a family member or for bereavement purposes. Consistent
with the limitations established by this legislation and in response to the comments described above, the final regulations
provide that all covered full-time employees may use a total of up to 40 hours (5 workdays) of sick leave each year for
family care or bereavement purposes. In addition, a covered full-time employee who maintains a balance of at least
80 hours of sick leave may use an additional 64 hours (8 workdays) of sick leave per year for these purposes, bringing
the total amount of sick leave available for family care and bereavement purposes to a maximum of 104 hours (13 workdays)
per year for employees who satisfy this condition. (See &sect;630.401 (b) through (d).)

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For a part-time employee or an employee with an uncommon tour of duty, the final regulations provide that the basic
amount of sick leave to be made available for family care or bereavement purposes shall be equal to the average number
of hours of work in the employee's scheduled tour of duty each week. In addition, a part-time employee or an employee
with an uncommon tour of duty who maintains a sick leave balance equal to at least 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
twice 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the average number of hours of work in the employee's scheduled tour of duty each week may use an amount equal to the number
of hours of sick leave normally accrued by the employee during a leave year for these purposes. These limitations are
consistent with the amendments made by the Federal Employees Family Friendly Leave Act, which authorizes OPM to prescribe
limitations for such employees that are proportional to those applicable to full-time employees with a tour of duty
of 40 hours per week.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OPM believes an annual limit of 104 hours (13 workdays) of sick leave to provide care for an ill or injured family member
will be an ample amount of time for most employees to give care and attendance to family members for illness or injury

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
when viewed in the context of other available options and entitlements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The entitlement to use a total of up to 104 hours of sick leave, in conjunction with a generous annual leave system, advanced
annual leave, the leave transfer and leave bank programs, flexible work schedules, flexiplace, unpaid leave under
the FMLA, and compensatory time off will further assist the vast majority of employees to meet their sickness-related
family care needs.

Sick Leave for Exposure to a Communicable Disease
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A labor organization, an agency, and some individuals commented that the 5-day limit on the use of sick leave for family
care purposes would restrict, rather than expand, entitlement to use sick leave in the case of employees who provide
care for a family member who is afflicted with a contagious disease. The labor organization pointed out that &sect;630.401(c)
of the current regulations places no limit on the amount of sick leave that may be used under these circumstances and
suggested that the 5-day limit would impose an unfair hardship when compared to the current policy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current regulatory provision authorizing the use of sick leave to care for ``a member of [the employee's] immediate
family who is afflicted with a contagious disease'' is based primarily on the need to prevent the spread of contagion
in the workplace. When the health authorities having jurisdiction or a health care provider determines that an employee's
exposure to a communicable disease would jeopardize the health of other employees, we continue to believe it is appropriate
to grant sick leave to the employee for the entire period of time during which the danger to the health of other employees
exists. However, when it cannot be determined that an employee's exposure to a communicable disease would jeopardize
the health of other employees, we do not believe there is any justification for allowing the employee to use more sick
leave than would be available to other employees who wish to provide care for a family member whose illness or incapacitation
is not the result of a communicable disease. In such cases, employees may request annual leave or leave without pay
to provide additional care and may also be eligible for participation in the Federal leave sharing program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The determination as to whether an employee's exposure to a communicable disease would jeopardize the health of other
employees necessarily is a matter of judgment. Supervisors should rely on the expertise of the health authorities
having jurisdiction or a health care provider in determining the period of time for which sick leave should be authorized
and may require the employee to submit medical documentation to support the use of sick leave under these circumstances
for an extended period of time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OPM also received five comments relating to other aspects of the proposed regulation on the use of sick leave in cases
of communicable disease. Some asked for additional clarification concerning what constitutes a ``severe communicable
disease.'' One agency recommended that the word ``severe'' be deleted. The agency reasoned that if the local health
authorities or health care provider has determined that a person so exposed is required to be isolated for a specified
period of time, the communicable disease must be ``severe.'' The agency suggested that using the modifier ``severe.''
may put management in the difficult position of second-guessing health authorities. We find this observation compelling
and have deleted the word ``severe.'' We have not attempted to define the term ``communicable disease,'' however,
because the key determination that has to be made is not whether a particular illness constitutes a ``communicable
disease,'' but whether an employees's exposure to the illness would jeopardize the health of other employees. This
determination can be made only by the health authorities having jurisdiction or a health care provider.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A labor organization objected to the characterization of a ``severe communicable disease'' as one that requires
``isolation for a specified period.'' It suggested that this characterization implies that if the health authorities
or health care provider does not, or cannot, identify a ``specified period'' of isolation, an application for sick
leave will be denied. We agree that this characterization is unnecessary and have revised &sect;630.401(a)(5) to
remove the reference to ``isolation'' altogether. In addition, we have removed the definition of ``contagious disease''
in &sect;630.201(b)(3). In response to another comment, we have also provided a definition of ``health care provider''
in &sect;630.201(b)(5).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of these changes, employees will be permitted to use sick leave for the entire period of time during which
the health authorities having jurisdiction or a health care provider determines that an employee's exposure to a
communicable disease would jeopardize the health of other employees. Full-time employees will be limited to a total
of 13 days of sick leave per year (subject to the requirement in &sect;630.401(c) to maintain 80 hours of sick leave
in their account) when it cannot be determined that an employee's exposure to a family member's communicable disease
would jeopardize the health of other employees.

Calculation of Sick Leave
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations would permit employees to use a total of up to 5 days of sick leave each year (or, in the case
of a part-time employee or an employee with an uncommon tour of duty, the average number of hours of work in the employee's
scheduled tour of duty each week) to provide care for a family member or for bereavement purposes. Several agencies
requested guidance on how to calculate the 5 days of sick leave for part-time employees or employees working compressed
work schedules. They asked what period of time an agency should use to determine the average number of hours of work
in an employee's tour of duty each week. One agency suggested that OPM use either days or hours, but not both. The agency
further recommended the use of hours to calculate the entitlement to sick leave to care for a family member because
granting 5 days of sick leave to a full-time employee on a compressed work schedule amounts to 50 hours for an employee
with a 10-hour daily tour of duty (and represents more that 1 week).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OPM agrees that it would be desirable to express these entitlements in terms of ``hours'' rather than ``days.'' As
a result, 5 CFR 630.401 has been revised accordingly. If the number of hours of work in an employee's tour of duty is changed
during the leave year, the employee's entitlement to use sick leave to care for a family member or for bereavement purposes
must be recalculated based on the new tour of duty. As provided in 5 CFR 630.206, employees may take sick leave to care
for a family member in increments of less than 1 hour if the agency's leave policies allow the granting of leave in increments
of less than 1 hour.

Recredit of Sick Leave
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Nineteen commenters supported OPM's proposal to remove the 3-year break-in-service limitation on the recredit
of sick leave; one individual opposed the change, believing that there should be a penalty for voluntary separation.
Many agencies and individuals believe the elimination of the 3-year limitation on the recredit of sick leave would
be an incentive for employees under the Federal Employees Retirement system (FERS) to save their sick leave as insurance
for possible future use. However, several individual employees objected to OPM's intent to make this change prospective.
These individuals thought our proposal unfairly discriminated against employees who had forfeited sick leave as
a result of returning to Federal service prior to the effective date of the rule change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OPM agrees that the proposed change in the rules on the recredit of sick leave fosters the conscientious use of sick
leave. Employees will no longer feel forced to use their sick leave prior to separating from the Federal Government
because there will no longer be a risk of forfeiting accrued sick leave when they return to Federal employment. However,
OPM does not believe it is feasible to give this change retroactive effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Administrative Procedure Act, retroactivity is not favored where it could work an inequity. OPM believes
retroactivity could create as many inequities as it alleviates, since any effective date that OPM selects (except
an indefinite retroactive effective date) will be perceived as unfair 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by employees who do not benefit from the change. An indefinite retroactive effective date for the recredit of sick
leave would cause administrative problems for Federal agencies because it may be difficult to identify all employees
who were adversely affected. In addition, it may be difficult, if not impossible, to reconstruct affected employees'
sick leave records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the comments we received, there appears to be confusion as to whether the removal of the 3-year break-in-service
limitation on the recredit of sick leave applies to an employee who resigns before the effective date of the regulations
and returns after the effective date. (OPM also received numerous telephone inquiries on this matter.) Therefore,
we have revised &sect;630.502(b) to state that a former employee is entitled to a recredit of sick leave (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
without regard to the date of his or her separation
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) if reemployed in the Federal Government on or after the effective date of these regulations, unless the sick leave
was forfeited upon reemployment in the Federal Government before the effective date of these regulations. Similar
revisions have also been made in &sect;&sect;630.502(c), (e), and (f) and 630.504(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reemployed annuitants also are entitled to a recredit of sick leave. However, the elimination of the 3-year restriction
on sick leave recredit does not affect the sick leave the reemployed annuitant had at the time of retirement if that
sick leave was creditable in the annuity computation. That sick leave balance became part of the annuity computation
and is no longer available for use as sick leave. Recredited sick leave will be added to the reemployed annuitant's
current sick leave account for use in his or her current employment. If the reemployed annuitant qualifies for a supplemental
or redetermined annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System, 5 U.S.C. 8344, any unused sick leave in his or her
sick leave account upon separation after reemployment may be included in the computation of the supplemental or redetermined
benefit.

Voluntary Leave Transfer and Leave Bank Programs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three agencies noted that an employee who applies to become a leave recipient under the voluntary leave transfer or
leave bank programs to care for a family member with a medical emergency must exhaust all available leave (excluding
advanced leave) before he or she becomes eligible for any donated leave. Since an employee was previously not permitted
to use sick leave to care for a family member (except in cases of contagious disease), there was no requirement to exhaust
available sick leave before requesting donated leave in such cases. The agencies suggested that an employee be required
to use the sick leave provided under &sect;630.401(b) to care for a family member before he or she can become eligible
for donated leave. OPM agrees that an employee is required to use the sick leave available under &sect;630.401(b)
through (d) before becoming eligible for donated leave to care for a family member. The regulations have been revised
to clarify this matter in the case of applications to become a leave recipient that are approved on or after the effective
date of these regulations. (See &sect;630.405(b).) In addition, the regulations have been revised to require an
employee who is in a shared leave status on the effective date of these regulations to use the sick leave available under
&sect;630.401(b) through (d) before he or she can continue using donated leave. (See &sect;630.405(c).)

Sick Leave for Adoption

Five commenters noted that OPM's proposal to revise the sick leave regulations did not include any provisions authorizing
the use of sick leave for purposes related to adoption, as recommended by the Report of the National Performance Review.
Under previous law, OPM did not have authority to permit the use of sick leave for adoption. However, section 629(b)
of Public Law 103&hyph;329, September 30, 1994, the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations
Act for fiscal year 1995, amends 5 U.S.C. 6307 to permit the use of sick leave for purposes relating to the adoption of
a child. In addition, the new law allows sick leave to be substituted retroactively for any annual leave used by an employee
for adoption-related purposes between September 30, 1991, and September 30, 1994. OPM is issuing interim regulations
permitting the use of sick leave for adoption-related purposes at the same time as the final sick leave regulations
are issued.

As required by the Federal Employees Family Friendly Leave Act, OPM must submit a report to Congress by June 22, 1997,
to evaluate the use of sick leave under the Federal Employees Family Friendly Leave Act and make a recommendation as
to whether or not the entitlements under the Act should continue beyond December 22, 1997. To enable OPM to have access
to sufficient information to make such an evaluation, a new section has been added at 5 CFR 630.408 to require agencies
to maintain and report to OPM information on each employee's use of sick leave to care for a family member or for bereavement
purposes as provided under the final regulations. Beginning with leave year 1995, the regulations require agencies
to maintain records on (1) the grade or pay level and gender of each employee; (2) the total number of hours of sick leave
used by each employee for family care or bereavement purposes and for all other purposes; and (3) any additional information
OPM may require.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three agencies observed that opening up sick leave usage to situations other than the employee's own medical needs
blurs the distinction between sick leave and annual leave. One agency suggested that this should be considered in

and family responsibilities.

Miscellaneous Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A labor organization requested that OPM clarify that the 5-day limitation on the use of sick leave to make arrangements
necessitated by the death of a family member or attend the funeral of a family member does not apply to an employee's
incapacitation due to sickness, including severe depression or emotional distress, resulting from the death of
a family member. OPM concurs with this comment. Employees who are incapacitated as a result of severe emotional distress
due to the death of a family member are entitled to use sick leave for their own sickness or illness. This is consistent
with an opinion of the Comptroller General (B&hyph;207444, October 20, 1982). In response to this comment, &sect;630.401(a)(2)
has been clarified to state that an employee may use sick leave because of incapacitation for the performance of duties
by physical or mental illness.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A professional organization suggested that OPM consider permitting Federal employees to transfer their available
annual leave to family members who are also employed by the Federal Government. This suggestion would require legislation.
Under current law, sections 6332 and 6362 of title 5, United States Code, specifically provide for the transfer of
annual leave only for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
medical emergencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several agencies requested guidance as to whether the 5 days of sick leave to care for a family member or for bereavement
purposes could be advanced and whether an employee may substitute the 5 days of sick leave for unpaid leave under the
FMLA, when appropriate. The sick leave available to covered employees for these purposes under the final regulations
may be advanced, and such employees may substitute sick leave for unpaid leave under the FMLA. In addition, an agency
questioned whether the 5 days of sick leave may accumulate over the years without limit, like sick leave generally,
even though only 5 days of sick leave may be used each leave year. If an employee does not use any or all of the amount of
sick leave provided under &sect;630.401 for family care or bereavement purposes in a leave year, it cannot be accumulated
in succeeding years to be used to care for a family member or for bereavement purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some agencies requested that OPM clearly define the situations in which an employee may use sick leave to care for a
family member_e.g., for medical and dental appointments or for a common cold, fever, or vomiting, since a child care
facility typically will not permit the attendance of a child with these symptoms. An agency questioned how the sick
leave program will be used in conjunction with other leave programs_e.g., the leave sharing program, the FMLA, and
advanced leave. Agencies have discretionary authority to administer the Federal leave program, consistent with
current law and regulations. OPM encourages agencies to assist employees in balancing their work and family responsibilities.
Agencies must apply the same criteria they would apply if an employee were suffering from a similar symptoms or receiving
medical, dental, or optical examination or treatment.

Finally, an agency requested that OPM consider revisions that would result in the crediting of sick leave in retirement
computations for employees covered by FERS or allow some type of payback for sick leave. This comment is beyond the
scope of these regulations and would require a legislative change.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The final regulations at &sect;630.401(a)(2) have been revised to permit the use of sick leave by an employee who is
incapacitated for the performance of his or her duties by physical or mental illness or to care for a family member incapacitated
as a result of physical or mental illness. The purpose of this change is to clarify the circumstances in which an employee
is entitled to use sick leave.

Waiver of Delay in Effective Date

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In the spirit of the President's memorandum of July 11, 1994, directing agencies to establish and support family-friendly
work arrangements, and consistent with the recent changes in law on the purposes for which sick leave may be used, I
find good cause exists for making these rules effective in less than 30 days pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3). The delay
in the effective date is being waived to give affected employees the benefit of these new provisions as of December
2, 1994.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) An employee's entitlement to use sick leave to care for a family member under &sect;630.401 shall be considered

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 629 of Public Law 103&hyph;329, The Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations Act
for fiscal year 1995, September 30, 1994, made two significant changes in leave entitlements for Federal employees.
Section 629(a) added section 6327 to title 5, United States Code, to provide employees with an entitlement to 7 days
of paid leave each calendar year (in addition to annual and sick leave) to serve as a bone-marrow or organ donor. The
law provides that an employee is entitled to use this leave without loss of or reduction in pay, leave to which otherwise
entitled, credit for time or service, or performance or efficiency rating. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM)
does not believe regulations are needed to administer section 6327. Agencies are responsible for notifying employees
of this new entitlement to paid leave.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The length of absence for such purposes will vary depending upon the medical circumstances of each case. For medical
procedures and recuperation requiring absences longer than 7 days, agencies are encouraged to continue to accommodate
employees by granting additional time off in the form of excused absence, accrued sick leave and/or annual leave,
as appropriate; leave without pay; and advanced sick and/or annual leave.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 629(b) amended 5 U.S.C. 6307 to permit an employee to use sick leave for purposes related to the adoption of
a child. (Conforming technical changes were also made in 5 U.S.C. 6129.) This change was recommended in the Report
of the National Performance Review on September 7, 1993. Section 629(b) also directs OPM to prescribe regulations
to allow an employee to substitute sick leave retroactively for all or any portion of any annual leave used by an employee
for adoption-related purposes between September 30, 1991, and September 30, 1994. (September 30, 1991, was the ending
date of the former 1-year experimental program created by Public Law 101&hyph;509 to test the feasibility of granting
sick leave for adoption-related purposes.) If an employee elects to make this substitution, the employing agency
must adjust the employee's leave accounts to reflect the amount of annual leave and sick leave, respectively, that
would remain had sick leave been used instead of all or any portion of the annual leave actually used, as designated
by the employee.

Sick Leave for Adoption
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OPM's sick leave regulations at 5 CFR 630.401 have been amended to permit employees to use accrued or accumulated sick
leave for purposes relating to the adoption of a child. In addition, &sect;630.402 has been revised to require employees
to request, to the extent possible, advance approval to use sick leave for adoption-related purposes. This is consistent
with current requirements related to the advance approval of sick leave for medical, dental, and optical examination
or treatment and to provide care for a family member. When required by the exigencies of the situation, an agency may
advance up to 30 days of sick leave for adoption-related purposes under 5 U.S.C. 6307(c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purposes of which an adoptive parent may request sick leave include appointments with adoption agencies, social
workers, and attorneys; court proceedings; required travel; and any other activities necessary to allow the adoption
to proceed. Since adoption procedures and requirements differ among jurisdictions and adoption agencies, the interim
regulations do not attempt to specify all of the circumstances in which the use of sick leave would be appropriate.
For example, sick leave may be granted for any periods during which an adoptive parent is ordered or required by the
adoption agency or by a court to be absent from work to care for the adopted child. Agencies are reminded that this new
entitlement to use sick leave for purposes relating to the adoption of a child is in addition to an employee's entitlement
to unpaid leave for the placement of a child with an employee for adoption under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993
(FMLA) (Pub. L. 103&hyph;3, February 5, 1993). (See 5 CFR 630.1203.)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The same limitations apply in the case of adopted children as in the case of biological children with regard to the use
of sick leave for the purpose of providing care for an adopted child as a result of physical or mental illness, injury,
impairment, pregnancy, or childbirth. These limitations are set forth in &sect;630.401 (b) through (d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under &sect;630.403, agencies may require employees to provide evidence that is administratively acceptable to
the agency in support of an employee's request for sick leave for adoption-related purposes. To ensure consistency
between the treatment of these employees and employees who may elect to invoke their entitlement to unpaid leave under
the FMLA for purposes relating to adoption, &sect;630.1206 has been revised to allow an agency to require an employee
to provide evidence that is administratively acceptable to the agency in support of an employee's notification of
his or her intent to use FMLA leave for adoption-related purposes.

Retroactive Substitution of Sick Leave for Annual Leave
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 629(b)(3) of Public Law 103&hyph;329 permits an employee to substitute his or her accrued and accumulated
sick leave for all or any portion of any annual leave used for purposes relating to the adoption of a child between September
30, 1991, and September 30, 1994. If an employee elects to make this substitution, the law requires the employee to
submit a written application to his or her employing agency to have his or her annual and sick leave accounts adjusted
accordingly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By law, an employee's written application to substitute sick leave retroactively for annual leave used for adoption-related
purposes must be submitted within 1 year after enactment of section 629 of Public Law 103&hyph;329_i.e., September
30, 1995_or such later date as OPM may prescribe. We believe additional time may be needed to notify affected employees
of this benefit and permit employees to submit a written application to their employing agencies. Therefore, in &sect;630.409,
OPM has extended the time period to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
September 30, 1996, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
for an employee to submit a written application to have his or her annual and sick leave accounts adjusted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The employee's written request must specify the period(s) and the amount(s) of annual leave involved and the amount(s)
of accrued or accumulated sick leave to be substituted. The written request must include copies of available documentation
described in the regulations that specify the period(s) and amount(s) of annual leave that were used by the employee
for adoption-related purposes between September 30, 1991, and September 30, 1994. If an employee is unable to provide
a written request that meets the requirements in the regulations, no substitution of sick leave may be approved. The
law does not permit the substitution of sick leave for leave without pay. In addition, advanced sick leave may not be
used for this purpose.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After receiving an employee's written request for substitution of sick leave for annual leave, the employing agency
will deduct from the employee's sick leave account any amount of sick leave the employee elects to substitute for any
annual leave used for adoption-related purposes after September 30, 1991. The employing agency also will credit
the employee's annual leave account with an amount of annual leave equal to the amount of sick leave the employee elects
to substitute. If an agency determines that insufficient written documentation exists to honor the employee's request,
the employing agency must inform the employee of this determination in writing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The annual leave credited to an employee's annual leave account shall be available for use by the employee on or after
the date the annual leave is credited in the same manner and for the same purposes as the employee's current accrued
and accumulated annual leave.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The retroactive substitution of sick leave for annual leave will result in additional amounts of annual leave being
credited to an employee's current annual leave account. If the credit of annual leave to an employee's current annual
leave account occurs just prior to the end of a leave year, the employee may be at risk of exceeding the maximum annual
leave ceiling established by 5 U.S.C. 6304. Therefore, OPM encourages agencies to advise employees that any annual
leave in excess of the maximum annual leave carry-over ceiling that results from such an adjustment may be forfeited
under 5 U.S.C. 6304, unless the annual leave is subject to restoration under the conditions specified in 5 U.S.C. 6304(d).

Waiver of Notice of Proposed Rule Making and Delay in Effective Date
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 629 of Public Law 103&hyph;329 became effective on September 30, 1994. The authority to substitute sick leave
for all or any portion of any annual leave taken for purposes relating to the adoption of a child is retroactive to September
30, 1991. In order to give practical effect to this legislation, I find good cause exists to waive the general notice
of proposed rulemaking pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B). Also, I find that good cause exists for making this rule
effective in less than thirty days. The delay in the effective date is being waived to give affected employees the benefit
of these new provisions at the earliest practical date.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Credit the employee's annual leave account with an amount of annual leave equal to the amount of sick leave the employee

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This action amends the final rule requiring that disposable latex gloves, or equivalent nonpermeable gloves, be
located onboard aircraft operated in air carrier, air taxi, and commercial operations. This amendment responds
to a petition for exemption filed by the Air Transport Association for an extension of the compliance date of December
2, 1994. With this amendment, the FAA will permit, for the next 18 months, that the protective gloves required for the
emergency medical kit may be placed in a location that is readily accessible to crewmembers. With this action, the
FAA will avoid a possible disruption in service to the traveling public because of the unavailability of sufficient
numbers of modified medical kits.

 publication of October 18, 1994, the FAA issued a final rule with comment that required disposable latex gloves, or
equivalent nonpermeable gloves, to be located onboard aircraft operated in air carrier, air taxi, and commercial
operations. This amendment responded to concerns of the FAA and some members of the aviation industry that a potential
health risk exists to crewmembers and passengers from the possibility of incidental exposure to blood borne pathogens.
The FAA stated that the amendment would lessen the possibility of that exposure and therefore increase the level of
safety for both passengers and crewmembers. The FAA also found that notice and public comment for the rulemaking was
impracticable and contrary to the public interest. The FAA stated that ``Because this rule will lessen a potential
health risk to passengers and crewmembers, those persons should not be further subjected to that potential risk by
a delay in issuing a final rule.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated November 14, 1994, the Air Transport Association (ATA) requests an extension of 18 months beyond the
December 2, 1994, compliance date. ATA states that the 45-day compliance requirement of the final rule puts the air
carrier industry in an impossible position in that the emergency medical kits (EMK) are prepared and serviced by a
very few vendors. Airlines have been notified by these few vendors that the 45-day modification schedule adopted
by the FAA will be impossible to meet, forcing the possible cancellation of flights due to the unavailability of modified
EMK. ATA proposes in its petition that, for the next 18 months, carriers be allowed to provide a sufficient quantity
of protective gloves distributed throughout the cabin of each aircraft in accessible locations. ATA notes that in
many cases, it will be possible to affix the gloves to the EMK. Further, ATA states that an equivalent level of safety
will be provided by maintaining the required numbers of pairs of gloves on the aircraft in accessible locations. ATA
posits that good cause exists for waiver of publication because of the pressing deadline and because the final rule
was not published for notice and public comment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA finds that the ATA presents a logical argument in that flights should not be delayed for modification of the
EMK and that an equivalent level of safety will be provided by locating the pair of protective gloves required for the
EMK in a location on the aircraft that is accessible to crewmembers.

Good Cause for Immediate Adoption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA finds that notice and public comment for this rulemaking is impracticable and contrary to the public interest.
This amendment contains a minor adjustment to the rule based on the fact that sufficient numbers of modified EMK will
not be available by the compliance date of December 2, 1994. In addition, the FAA finds that there will be no adverse
affect on safety since the required number of protective gloves will be made available on each aircraft. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments on the amendment are invited, however, and the Administrator may amend or rescind the amendment in view of
public comment. Comments should identify Docket No. 27926 and be submitted in triplicate to the address provided
above. All comments will be available for public review, both before and after the closing date for comments.

Conclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the reasons discussed in the preamble of Amendment No. 121&hyph;242, issued September 26, 1994, and based on the
findings in that Regulatory Flexibility Determination and that International Trade Impact Analysis, the FAA has
determined that this regulation is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866. In addition,
it is certified that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial
number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. This regulation is not considered
significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979).
