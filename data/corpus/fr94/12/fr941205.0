<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing interim regulations to clarify the policy under which it invites
applications from comprehensive medical plans (HMO's) after a determination that it would be beneficial to enrollees
and the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program to do so. This clarification is necessary in order to ensure
that OPM and the HMO's are providing the best possible service to FEHB enrollees.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 OPM is issuing interim regulations to clarify the policy under which the Director of OPM invites applications from
HMOs interested in participating in the FEHB Program. As administrator of the FEHB Program, it is necessary that OPM
consider the needs of FEHB enrollees and the FEHB Program in determining whether to invite applications from HMOs
for a given contract year. Consequently, each year, the Director makes a determination whether or not it would be beneficial
to enrollees and the FEHB Program to invite HMOs to apply. This authority parallels OPM's discretion to consider changes
in the rates and benefits of participating plans when the Director of OPM deems it in the best interest of enrollees
and the FEHB Program (&sect;890.203(b)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With only limited possible exception, OPM does not intend to accept HMO applications for the 1996 contract year. We
also plan to keep in place for the 1996 contract year the benefits that go into effect in 1995 for plans already participating
in the FEHB Program. Further, OPM will print no new plan brochures for existing plans or comparison guide for contract
year 1996.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On a limited basis, OPM will entertain applications from HMOs where it would improve the access to medical care in a
medically underserved state. That is, we will consider applications from HMOs only in states designated as medically
underserved areas (MUAs), as determined by OPM under the methodology cited in 5 U.S.C. 8902(m)(2)(A), where the choice
of an HMO is limited or would otherwise be nonexistent. To be considered by OPM, the plan must be in a state that qualifies
as an MUA on January 31 of the year preceding the FEHB Program contract year for which the application has been submitted.
OPM expects that, under this exception, plans will be accepted only under rare and unusual circumstances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Except in these situations, the information disseminated during the November&hyph;December 1995 Open Season will
be limited to rate change information for plans currently participating in the Program. In the future, OPM will publish
a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 inviting applications from plans interested in participating in the FEHB Program. We anticipate considering all
applications for contract year 1997.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This course of action is necessary so that OPM may utilize its resources in the most effective way and in a manner most
beneficial to enrollees. It is in the best interest of enrollees that OPM ensure that FEHB Program contracts are administered
so that benefits to enrollees are optimum and the costs to enrollees and the FEHB Program are minimized. OPM shares
the concern of the Congress, the General Accounting Office (GAO), and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) about
contract administration under the FEHB Program. In order to improve standards and oversight of insurance carriers
and enhance our overall program operations to improve service to OPM's customers, additional emphasis needs to be
placed on functions that, of necessity, are given lower priority when staff are occupied with applications, negotiations,
and open season materials review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During 1995, OPM will redirect resources to projects designed to address weaknesses in the oversight of contractor
performance as well as improve communication with FEHB enrollees to ensure that we and our participating carriers
are meeting their needs. In future years, we will prioritize functions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While OPM is not required to issue regulations that clarify existing policy, we understand that there is interest
in this issue, and we wish to give all parties an opportunity to comment. We are publishing the regulation at this time
before interested HMOs begin the time-consuming application process.

Pursuant to section 553(b)(3)(A) of title 5 of the U.S. Code, I find that good cause exists for waiving the general notice
of proposed rulemaking. The interim regulations simply clarify OPM's policy under which it invites applications
from HMO's interested in participating in the FEHB Program.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule streamlines the adjudication of asylum applications submitted to the Immigration and Naturalization
Service (INS). Asylum officers who adjudicate the applications of persons who have no legal immigration status will
no longer prepare detailed denials. Instead, in almost all cases, asylum officers will grant meritorious applications
and refer applications that they do not grant to immigration judges, who will adjudicate the claims in either exclusion
or deportation proceedings. The rule restricts employment authorization to applicants for asylum or withholding
of deportation whose claims either have been granted or remain pending after more than 150 days, a period which would
not run until the alien has filed a complete application and which would not include delays sought or caused by the applicant.
This rule conforms existing regulations to the current practice of receiving applications for asylum and withholding
of deportation at the four INS Service Centers. The rule also updates the regulations by removing references to the
Asylum Policy and Review Unit.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Justice published a proposed rule on March 30, 1994 (59 FR 14779) as part of a comprehensive initiative
to streamline the process for adjudication of applications for asylum and withholding of deportation. Other aspects
of this initiative have increased the government's ability to adjudicate such applications efficiently. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule was designed to streamline the asylum adjudications process by making several principal reforms.
First, the role and functions of asylum officers would change to allow the officers to address a greater volume of applications
and to concentrate their efforts on approving meritorious claims. Asylum officers would no longer deny applications
from persons who are excludable or deportable, but instead would refer such cases directly to an immigration judge
for adjudication. The original application also would be forwarded to the immigration judge to form part of the record
of proceedings. Second, the proposed rule would have instituted a fee for filing asylum applications. Third, an asylum
applicant would not be eligible to apply for employment authorization based on his or her asylum application until
150 days after the date on which the asylum application is filed. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)
and the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) would strive to complete the adjudication of asylum applications,
through the decision of an immigration judge, within this 150-day period. Persons granted asylum would become eligible
immediately to apply for and receive employment authorization. Persons whose cases were not decided by an immigration
judge within the 150-day period would be eligible to apply for employment authorization. The INS would have 30 days
to adjudicate such applications. Persons denied asylum by an immigration judge either within the 150-day period
or prior to the issuance of employment authorization by the INS would not be eligible to receive employment authorization.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Beyond these principal reforms, the proposed rule would have: eliminated the requirement that asylum officers and
immigration judges await the receipt of advisory opinions from the Department of State; curtailed the authority
of asylum officers to grant or deny withholding of deportation under section 243(h) of the Immigration and Nationality
Act, 8 U.S.C. 1253(h) (INA or Act); and specified that information provided in asylum applications could be used as
a basis for an Order to Show Cause against the applicant under 8 CFR 242.1. The proposed rule also would have made several
technical and conforming amendments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of Justice received 345 comments in response to this proposed rule. Many were submitted as a result
of consultations between various non-governmental organizations. The following sections summarize the comments,
set forth the response of the Department of Justice, and explain the revisions adopted.

The comments primarily focused upon the following topics: conformity with the Administrative Procedure Act (APA);
constitutional questions; the proposed $130 filing fee; retroactivity of the proposed rule; service of notice;
employment authorization; the discretionary nature of asylum interviews; interpreters; the ``safe third country''
ground of denial for applicants otherwise eligible for asylum; the elimination of the Notice of Intent to Deny (NOID)
and the applicant's opportunity to rebut a NOID; and the definition and treatment of persons convicted of an aggravated
felony. In addition, there were general comments regarding United States immigration policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many comments agreed that asylum reforms and a solution to the backlog problem are needed. Some stated, however, that
even if the proposed rule met the objectives of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, it would do so at the expense

Several comments stated that the proposed rule violated the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)
because the rule included changes to regulations affecting the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR),
and the INS has no authority to promulgate regulations on behalf of EOIR. Sections alleged to fall within EOIR's jurisdiction
were 208.1, 208.2, 208.3, 208.12, 208.14, 208.18, 236.3, and 242.17. The comments suggested that the Department
should republish the sections of the proposed rule that pertain to EOIR proceedings with instructions that comments
should be directed to the EOIR.

The proposed rule was published by the Department of Justice. The Attorney General has authority to promulgate regulations
on behalf of all Department of Justice agencies, including INS and EOIR. Officials of EOIR participated in drafting
all relevant provisions of the proposed rule. Upon publication of the rule, the name, address, and phone number of
the Counsel to the Director of EOIR were included as a point of contact for further information. Since this rule chiefly
concerns the process for adjudicating asylum applications that are received in the first instance by the INS, public
comments were directed to the INS; however, a copy of every comment was forwarded by the INS to EOIR. Specific suggestions
were made by EOIR and have been incorporated into this final rule. Accordingly, this rule has been issued in compliance
with the notice and comment requirements of the APA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several comments stated that the proposed rule would violate the Constitution by infringing upon liberty and property
interests protected under the due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The comments identified
the following as violations of due process: (a) not every asylum applicant would receive an asylum officer interview,
which is essential for an asylum officer genuinely to evaluate a case; (b) those denied an interview would be deprived
of the opportunity to have their claim decided in a non-adversarial setting and instead would be required to present
their asylum claim to an immigration judge during an adversarial proceeding; (c) an applicant not granted asylum
would be denied the opportunity, available under the current procedures, to rebut the asylum officer's initial determination
to deny the claim (Notice of Intent to Deny); and (d) due to elimination of the Notice of Intent to Deny (NOID), the applicant
would not have access to the information that the asylum officer relied upon in deciding not to grant the claim. The
comments stated that such infringement could not be justified by the Government's interest in improving the efficiency
or financial viability of the asylum process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments stated that procedures similar to those in the proposed rule have been invalidated by the federal courts.
They pointed to Mendez v. Thornburgh, No. 88&hyph;04995 (C.D. Cal., Order filed May 26, 1989, modified June 23, 1989),
in which the court preliminarily enjoined an expedited adjudication process put into place in Los Angeles and stated
that applicants were entitled to a re-interview. Comments also noted

Response and Disposition: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule fully recognized the due process rights of asylum applicants. By preserving asylum and withholding
of deportation proceedings before an immigration judge, the rule provides due process: (a) the applicant is permitted
to testify and submit all relevant evidence in support of his or her claim; (b) the applicant may be represented by an
attorney; (c) the applicant is entitled to cross-examine all witnesses presented by the Government and to rebut any
documentary evidence submitted by the Government; and (d) the applicant has the right to administrative appeal and
judicial review of an adverse decision. In addition, as discussed below, the final rule amends the proposed rule by
providing that the INS will conduct interviews for all asylum applicants within its jurisdiction who have filed a
complete application. All who apply for asylum before an asylum officer will thus have an opportunity to present their
claim in a nonadversarial proceeding. Furthermore, neither the settlement agreement in Mendez nor the settlement
agreement in ABC suggests that INS procedures were invalid. The rule does not single out any class of applicants for
distinct treatment and all asylum applicants will be treated in the same manner without regard to nationality or country
of origin. Asylum officers will interview all applicants who appear for their scheduled interviews before determining
whether to grant, deny, or refer their applications.

Comments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several comments argued that the proposed rule required a ``cost benefit assessment'' under Executive Order 12866
because it constitutes a ``significant regulatory action.'' The comments also suggested that the Department was
required to perform a ``federalism assessment'' under Executive Order 12612, since portions of the regulation could
affect state governments' public welfare programs. The comments argued that the inability of asylum applicants
to work for 180 days and during the appeal process could lead the applicants and their families to rely on state public
assistance that they might not turn to if authorized to work. This, the comments stated, constitutes a ``substantial
direct effect on the States,'' triggering the need for a federalism assessment.

Response and Disposition:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Executive Order 12866 requires an agency to submit a draft proposed rule and an assessment of the potential costs and
benefits of the regulation to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review if the agency or OMB considers the
rule ``to be a significant regulatory action'' under section 3(f) of that Order. The Department of Justice considered
the proposed rule to be a significant regulatory action and complied with the Executive Order by submitting a copy
of the draft proposed rule and a summary of the reasons for the regulation to the OMB. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
59 FR 14784 (March 30, 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Order 12612 requires a federalism assessment if a proposed regulation has ``substantial direct effects
on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on distribution of power and
responsibilities among the various levels of government.'' Whether policies have federalism implications depends
principally on whether the policies would preempt state law or interfere with an area of regulation that is usually
reserved to the states. If an agency determines that a policy has federalism implications, the federalism assessment
must consider the costs or burdens the regulations would impose on the states and resources available to the states
to offset the added costs or burdens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department and OMB determined that Executive Order 12612 did not require a federalism assessment of this rule.
Regulations regarding immigration and alienage are an exclusive federal concern, and thus do not preempt state law
or impinge upon areas of state regulation. Furthermore, Congress has enacted specific legislation governing the
employment of aliens which authorized the promulgation of regulations on the subject. The rule also would not have
a substantial direct effect on the states. While it is possible that asylum applicants not eligible to apply for work
authorization might seek state benefits, the nature and degree of any such claims are at best an indirect effect of
the adoption of new asylum procedures. Many asylum seekers have entered the United States illegally and are not eligible
for most state benefits; and some state benefits, such as education, are available regardless of whether an applicant
has work authorization. Meanwhile, the overall asylum reform effort should reduce the pressure on state public assistance
benefits by more promptly granting asylum and work authorization to those deserving of these benefits and more promptly
removing from the United States those who are not. Accordingly, there is no need for a federalism assessment under
Executive Order 12612.

4. Filing Fee for Asylum Applications (8 CFR 103.7(b)(1))

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Proposed Rule:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed rule would have amended 8 CFR 103.7(b)(1) to provide that a fee of $130 be charged for an application for
asylum or withholding of deportation. Section 208.4(d) would have been amended to provide that an application be
accompanied by such fee or by an application for waiver of fee in accordance with 8 CFR 103.7(c)(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Comments supporting fees argued that asylum applicants should have to pay a filing fee if they can afford to do so, that
the general public does not benefit from services provided by the INS, and that taxpayers should not have to bear the
entire cost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most comments, however, urged either elimination or reduction of the fee. It was argued that the proposed fee would
unfairly punish persons seeking protection from persecution, treat asylum as a privilege limited to those who could
afford it, discourage 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
bona fide 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
applications, and create a burden for the INS in administering the fee waiver provisions. Several comments claimed
that the fee would be unfair in light of the proposed rule's limitation on an asylum applicant's access to employment
authorization pending the adjudication of the asylum claim. Other comments stated that the amount of the fee was excessive:
even if an applicant could not qualify for a fee waiver, he or she might still be unable to apply for asylum due to the overall
cost, including those for an attorney, counselor, and interpreter, to complete the asylum application process.
These comments unfavorably compared the proposed fee to those charged by The Netherlands ($25.00) and Australia
($30.00), the only countries that now charge an application fee, and suggested that a fee at this level would be more
appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments also argued that charging a fee would not be economically efficient. Collecting the fee and administering
a waiver system would create significant administrative costs. Adjudicating waivers, aside from being time-consuming,
would increase personnel costs and paperwork, would add an additional step to the adjudication process, and would
expose the INS to litigation over contested waiver decisions. If, as anticipated, a large number of applicants applied
for and obtained fee waivers, the costs in administering the fee and the waiver might not even offset the relatively
low amount of fees collected.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several comments also questioned whether the INS could fairly administer a fee waiver process. They alleged that
the INS previously has used improper criteria in adjudicating applications for waivers of fees for Temporary Protected
Status and for renewal of employment authorization documents. These comments urged that the process be fairly implemented
by removing irrelevant discretionary factors from the waiver procedure and focusing solely on the applicant's ability
to pay the fee. Some argued that the INS should propose, publish, and elicit public comments on uniform guidelines
for adjudicating fee waivers for all INS applications. Others argued that the INS should create a fee waiver process
for asylum applicants under a separate regulation, independent of 8 CFR 103.7(c). Some proposed that asylum applicants
filing through an approved voluntary agency or an accredited representative should receive automatic fee waivers.
Many comments suggested that waiver guidelines should incorporate the poverty guidelines of the Department of Health
and Human Services. Some comments suggested that a time limit be set within which the INS must make waiver determinations
and, if the decision is not made within that time, that the waiver be granted. Comments also suggested that the fee-paying
or waiver status of the applicant not be disclosed to the asylum officer adjudicating the claim. One comment suggested
that the filing of a fraudulent fee waiver be used as evidence weighing against the applicant's credibility on the
underlying asylum claim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments stated that under section 286(m) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1356(m), the INS may not impose a fee for asylum
applications. This section provides that the INS may set its fee for providing adjudication and naturalization services
at a level that will ensure the full recovery of costs for those services, including those provided without charge
to asylum applicants or other immigrants. Several comments also stated that a specific fee for asylum applications
is unnecessary because after the implementation of asylum reform, the surcharge added to INS fees in conformance
with section 286(m) should generate sufficient revenues to cover the costs of the asylum program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of comments made recommendations for changing the fee proposal. One comment proposed setting the fee at $615,
which is the estimated total cost of adjudicating an asylum application. Under this proposal, if the applicant could
not pay the fee at the time of filing, then he or she should pay half of the fee at the time of filing and pay the balance within
90 days or at the time of the interview, whichever is sooner. One comment suggested loaning the entire cost of asylum
processing ($615) to the applicant. The loan could be paid back in one to three years as the person begins to work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some comments suggested that the fee be deferred so that a person granted asylum pay the fee when he or she applies for
adjustment of status or for any other subsequent benefit under the Act. For those whose applications are denied and
who subsequently seek another immigration benefit, such as adjustment of status upon marriage or reentry after deportation,
the asylum fee would be collected at the time the applicant submits the respective application. The comments argued
that applicants will be in a better position to pay the fee at the time of these subsequent applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment suggested that the fee not be charged to those who file their asylum application before an immigration
judge in exclusion or deportation proceedings. This comment noted that most of the alleged abuse of the asylum system
occurs in applications filed with asylum officers and that it is unfair to charge a fee to those who are defending themselves
in removal proceedings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response and Disposition:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The comments received in response to the fee proposal have been carefully considered. It has been concluded that imposition
of the fee at this time would likely impose administrative burdens that would not be offset by the anticipated receipts
from the fee. Accordingly, the provisions relating to the fee are not included as part of the final rule. Adjudication
of asylum applications before the INS will continue to be funded by way of a statutorily authorized surcharge assessed
on applications for other immigration benefits. Additional funding provided by the 1995 appropriations for Asylum
Reform will provide resources for INS and EOIR. As part of an ongoing comprehensive economic review of its entire fee
structure, the INS will examine alternative sources of funding for asylum adjudications, including the possibility
of a user fee.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Many comments urged INS not to apply some or all of the proposed amendments to Part 208 to applications filed prior to
the effective date of the final rule. These comments suggested that a ``retroactive'' application of the rule could
result in different treatment for asylum applicants who filed at the same time, but prior to the effective date of the
final rule_namely: claims filed and adjudicated before the effective date of the final rule will have been processed
under the prior practice of a mandatory asylum officer interview and opportunity to rebut a NOID; NOIDs are eliminated
for claims filed but not adjudicated by the effective date and, under the proposed rule, such claims could be referred
immediately to an immigration judge without an interview by an asylum officer. Some comments also noted that making
the rule applicable to applications that have already been filed would have no effect in discouraging the prospective
filing of non-meritorious applications.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The rule is not ``retroactive'' within the meaning of that case because it does not alter the past legal consequences
of past actions; rather, it affects only procedures that are to be followed in cases that are yet to be adjudicated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The effective date provision applies only to adjudications of applications for asylum or withholding of deportation
under 8 CFR Part 208. The rule therefore will not apply to the amended provisions of 8 CFR 242.17(e) regarding the use
of information provided on an asylum application as the basis for establishing the alienage or deportability of an
asylum applicant, or to the related provision at 8 CFR 208.3(c)(2). These amended provisions will apply only to applications
received by the INS after the effective date of the final rule. Similarly, the effective date provisions do not affect
8 CFR 274a.12(c)(8). Thus, asylum applicants who have filed their applications prior to the effective date of the
final rule will not be subject to the final rule's provisions governing initial applications for employment authorization.
Sections 208.7(a) and 242.17(e) of the final rule will be amended to clarify this point. However, the rule governing
extensions of employment authorization in &sect;208.7(d) shall apply to all asylum applicants upon the effective
date of this rule. Furthermore, the final rule cannot and does not intend to alter any obligations imposed on the INS
or asylum applicants by judicial decisions or settlement agreements in cases such as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

 or 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Mendez.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Finally, the rule will not apply to cases pending in district courts, courts of appeals, or the Supreme Court. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other aspects of the rule, while they would affect pending applications, do not affect the past legal consequences
of past actions, but merely affect procedures to be applied in the future. The main procedural differences under this
rule are elimination of the NOID and written denial decisions by asylum officers. These changes, however, do not alter
the legal circumstances or rights of any person with a pending application. No person eligible for asylum under existing
regulations will be rendered ineligible due to any change made by this rule. Asylum claims will continue to be adjudicated
under the same legal standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Limiting application of the final rule to applications filed after the effective date would severely impair efforts
at asylum reform because it would require two parallel systems of adjudication: one for cases filed before the effective
date, one for cases filed afterwards. Neither the Supreme Court's decision in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Bowen
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nor any section of the APA requires such a result. The rule achieves the goal of streamlining the asylum process while
maintaining the same legal standards used to adjudicate each asylum application in a timely manner. This provision
of the proposed rule will be adopted in the final rule with amendments for clarity.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The final rule has been clarified to make clear that the I&hyph;589 and supporting documents, plus two copies, are
required. Three copies of supporting documentation are required because one copy is retained by the INS in the applicant's
alien registration file, one copy is forwarded to the Department of State under 8 CFR 208.4(a), and, if the application
is not granted by the asylum officer, a copy of the application with all supporting documents is forwarded to the immigration

Proposed Rule:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 208.3(c)(2) of the proposed rule stated that information provided in an asylum application may be used to
satisfy the Government's burden of proof in establishing deportability under section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1252.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One comment asserted that the proposed rule should state that the information in the asylum application may not satisfy
the clear, convincing, and unequivocal standard of evidence for deportability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response and Disposition:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department believes that an alien's written admission of alienage and of having no lawful status in the United
States is sufficient to satisfy the standard of evidence for establishing deportability. Consequently, the new
asylum application will contain a clear warning that the application may be used to establish deportability. This
part of the final rule will not be applied retroactively and will affect only those persons who make an application
on the new form after the effective date of this rule. Accordingly, this provision of the proposed rule will be adopted
without amendment in the final rule.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Proposed Rule: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 208.3(c)(3) of the proposed rule stated that mailing to the address provided on the application shall constitute
adequate service of all notices and other documents, including any charging documents (Forms I&hyph;221 and I&hyph;122).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several comments argued that delivery by regular mail of an Order to Show Cause (OSC) violates section 242B(a)(1)
of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1252b(a)(1), which requires that OSCs be presented by personal service or certified mail. Other
comments argued that the OSC should be served by certified mail to ensure that it is actually received and that the rule
does not take into consideration that an applicant may move after his or her application has been filed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three comments also addressed the issue of service to legal representatives. One comment stated that if the applicant
is represented by an attorney, service should be made on the applicant's legal representative, rather than on the
applicant. Another comment recommended that mailing documents to the applicant's attorney or representative also
should constitute adequate service. Finally, a comment asserted that EOIR should be informed whether an applicant
was represented by an attorney at the Asylum Office. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response and Disposition: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This provision is not intended to_and legally could not_alter the certified mail delivery requirements in section
242B of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1252b. In cases where personal delivery of the OSC is not possible, OSCs will continue to be
served by certified mail. This provision is adopted with an appropriate clarifying amendment in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The recommendations regarding service upon attorneys or registered representatives have been considered carefully.
The Department believes that the rules for service of an OSC must ensure that the person subject to proceedings has
actually received the document. The Department also is concerned that an attorney retained for the asylum process
might not remain as the applicant's attorney in exclusion or deportation proceedings. As this final rule is implemented,
the INS will work with attorneys and advocacy organizations to consider these and other proposals relating to the
service of notices and other documents, but the suggestion of having charging documents mailed to an applicant's
attorney or representative constitute adequate service has not been adopted.

Proposed Rule: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 208.3(c)(4) and 208.3(d) of the proposed rule stated that the applicant and anyone other than an immediate
relative of the applicant who prepares or assists the applicant in preparing the asylum application must sign the
application subject to penalty of perjury. A person other than an immediate relative who prepares or assists the applicant
in preparing the application also must provide his or her full mailing address. In addition, if the applicant later
claims ignorance of the contents of the application, his or her signature may provide the basis for denial of the claim.

Comments:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several comments suggested that any preparer, including an immediate relative, sign the asylum application under
penalty of perjury and provide an address. One comment argued that exempting family members from signing the I&hyph;589
weakens the regulation because unscrupulous preparers, to remain undetected, will not sign the application.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many other comments criticized this provision as unduly punitive because many asylum applicants have limited education,
are unfamiliar with United States laws, and rely on those who claim to be qualified to assist them with their asylum
applications. Such applicants should not be subject to prosecution if there are errors in the application. Some comments
asserted that this provision will prevent applicants from obtaining help in completing their applications. In addition,
one comment claimed that those assisting applicants might fear reprisal from their own governments if their role
in assisting asylum applicants were known. Another stated that organizations may not wish to sign the forms because
of their unwillingness to incur potential liability for an inaccurate representation not known to them. One comment
argued that subjecting persons other than the applicant to penalty of perjury places an undue burden on attorneys
and translators who are assisting applicants but can do little to verify the veracity of the applicants' statements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments made several recommendations directed at protecting applicants and the individuals and organizations
who assist applicants. One comment recommended that only the preparers, not the applicants, should sign the asylum
application subject to a penalty of perjury because genuine asylum-seekers, particularly those that do not speak
English, may be unaware of the actions of an unprincipled preparer. One comment advocated that those who prepare asylum
applications without charging the applicant a fee should not be required to sign the form. Another comment suggested
that if an improperly prepared asylum application is not signed by the preparer, the asylum officer should ask the
applicant who prepared the application. With the applicant's permission, the asylum officer then could relay the
information about the preparer to the appropriate local INS enforcement division. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, two comments asserted that the signature requirement is too broad. The comments claimed that the signature
requirement in the proposed rule is more sweeping than the requirement on the form itself, and that it fails to specify
the degree of assistance that triggers the necessity to sign the form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response and Disposition: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The requirement that the applicant and outside preparers sign the Form I&hyph;589 under penalty of perjury is necessary
and appropriate for several reasons. An asylum applicant is seeking an important benefit and should be required to
provide only truthful information to the Government. The evidentiary rules for adjudicating asylum applications
treat the credible testimony of the applicant as sufficient to meet the applicant's burden of proof and thus there
should be appropriate consequences for making false statements. Those who assist in preparing applications also
should bear these consequences if they have knowingly included false information on the application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fact that a signature is made under penalty of perjury does not, of course, alter the Government's burden to establish
the elements of the crime in the event of prosecution. Many of the objections raised in the comments would apply to situations
where perjury could not be proved. Nevertheless, those applying for asylum and those who assist others in doing so
should have the same obligation to make truthful statements as persons who make other applications to the Government.
These provisions of the proposed rule will be adopted in the final rule, with amendments for clarity and to eliminate
unnecessary words.

Proposed Rule: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 208.3(c)(5) of the proposed rule stated that an application that is incomplete or lacks a response to each
of the enumerated questions may be referred to an immigration judge for adjudication or may be denied by the asylum
officer. Section 208.3(c)(6) defined an incomplete application as one that does not include a response to each of
the questions contained in the Form I&hyph;589, that is unsigned, that is unaccompanied by the required materials
specified in paragraph (a) of this section, or that is unaccompanied by the required fee or application for fee waiver.

Comments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Numerous comments criticized these provisions for establishing overly harsh penalties and for not including a sufficiently
clear definition of what constitutes an incomplete application. The comments claimed that an application may be
denied or referred because minor or irrelevant questions were not answered. The comments suggested that the applicant
be given a chance to remedy such an omission. The comments also questioned whether an application would be deemed incomplete
if certain questions were answered but the responses lacked substance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments agreed that incomplete applications should not be adjudicated and recommended amendments to the
rule. One comment suggested that this provision be moved to a new subsection and labelled ``Summary Disposition_Action
on Incomplete Forms.'' Another comment suggested that the term ``incomplete'' be deleted from the final rule in order
to restrict the rule to allow denial or referral only when the applicant has been completely unresponsive to a question.
A third comment advocated that incomplete applications be returned to the applicant, rather than denying them or
referring them to an immigration judge.

Response and Disposition:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The final rule retains the current mandate that all asylum applicants who appear as scheduled will receive an interview
with an asylum officer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, incomplete applications will not be denied or referred to an immigration judge without an interview.
These sections of the proposed rule are therefore adopted with appropriate amendments in the final rule. The final
rule provides that an incomplete application shall be returned by mailing it to an applicant within 30 days of receipt
of the application by the INS; and that if an application has not been returned within this 30-day period, the application
shall be deemed complete. Under section 208.7 of the final rule, if the application is incomplete, the 150-day period
will not begin until the applicant submits a complete application. For clarity, the last sentence of &sect;208.3(c)(6)
of the proposed rule, defining an incomplete application, is moved to paragraph &sect;208.3(c)(5) of the final rule.
This definition also has been clarified to state that an application that is not returned to an applicant within 30
days of having been received by the INS shall be deemed complete.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Proposed Rule:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed rule would have amended the regulations governing eligibility of asylum applicants for employment
authorization in the following manner: An application for employment authorization (Form I&hyph;765) could be
submitted to the INS no earlier than 150 days after the date on which a complete application for asylum was filed. If
the asylum application was denied by an immigration judge or an asylum officer within the 150-day period, the applicant
would not be eligible to apply for employment authorization. After 150 days, the INS would have 30 days from the date
of the filing of the application for employment authorization to adjudicate the application for employment authorization.
If the INS failed to adjudicate the application for employment authorization within the 30-day period, the applicant
would be eligible for interim employment authorization. If the application for asylum was denied by an immigration
judge or an asylum officer within this 30-day period, the application for employment authorization would be denied.
The 150- and 180-day periods would be extended by any delay sought or caused by the applicant. The proposed rule also
would have prohibited an applicant for asylum who has been convicted of an aggravated felony from applying for or being
granted employment authorization. If an applicant who has been convicted of an aggravated felony has previously
been granted employment authorization, the employment authorization would be revoked. Finally, an applicant who
inexcusably failed to appear for a scheduled interview before an asylum officer or a hearing before the immigration
judge would not be granted employment authorization. The proposed rule also would have amended the current rule by
requiring a fee for the filing of an initial application for employment authorization.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A few comments supported these proposals as an appropriate balance between meeting the needs of asylum applicants
while discouraging frivolous claims. A greater number of comments criticized these provisions for imposing economic
hardship on asylum applicants. The comments stated that many applicants arrive in the United States with few belongings,
no money, and no network of family or friends to provide them assistance. Furthermore, the United States does not provide
public assistance benefits to most people who apply for asylum. As a result, asylum applicants would be forced to work
illegally in jobs where they would be underpaid and treated poorly, but would have no means of redress because of the
fear of reprisals. Other comments claimed that the rule would violate the right to work of asylum applicants and is
inconsistent with the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, 189 U.N.T.S. 150, 19 U.S.T. 6260, T.I.A.S.
6577, and the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, 606 U.N.T.S. 267, 19 U.S.T. 6223, T.I.A.S. 6577, because
it creates an obstacle to the filing of an asylum application. Comments also stated that the rule would deny due process
to asylum applicants because they would be unable to afford attorneys to represent them. Numerous other comments
claimed that the rule would impose new burdens on social service organizations and state and local governments because
asylum applicants unable to work will turn to these sources for assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment specifically observed that a greater number of Cubans and Haitians will apply for cash and medical benefits
under the Refugee Education Assistance Act of 1980, 8 U.S.C. 1522 note, and suggested that Cubans and Haitians be exempt
from the employment authorization limitations under 8 CFR 208.7(a). Another comment contended that applicants
paroled into the United States to file asylum claims will lose their work authorization under the proposed rule, which
would be unjust because many such parolees have been recognized by the INS to have credible asylum claims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some comments indicated that the proposed rule is confusing because it does not specify that persons granted asylum
are immediately eligible for work authorization and does not provide sufficient detail on how the 150-day waiting
period will be measured. Other comments expressed doubt that asylum applicants would actually receive work authorization
180 days after the filing of their applications because of difficulty and confusion in applying the 150-day waiting
period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many comments advocated eliminating the waiting period and maintaining the current rule, which allows immediate
applications for employment authorization and issuance within 90 days. Some comments suggested a decrease in the
waiting period with one specifically stating that employment authorization valid for 3 to 6 months should be granted
at the time of the interview or within 90 days, except for cases deemed ``frivolous'' or ``manifestly unfounded.''
Another comment advised providing exceptions to the waiting period by granting employment authorization immediately
or within 90 days to applicants who demonstrate hardship or economic need (such as those with no relatives in the United
States or who have small children). Another comment advocated issuing employment authorization at the time of the
interview or hearing because it would ensure that applicants appear for their interview or hearing and allow the applicant
to receive employment authorization sooner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of comments suggested clarification of the 150-day waiting period. One comment noted that the 150-day period
should begin when the application is received by the INS, rather than when the application is actually processed.
Some comments argued that the INS should notify the applicant in writing of the date of receipt and whether the application
is complete. Other comments criticized the provision for an extension of the 150-day period in the case of delays caused
by the applicant, and one comment recommended that this aspect be eliminated. Another comment suggested, however,
that the applicant be notified when additional information is required and the waiting period be extended only if
the additional information is not provided. Other comments asked for clarification as to what actions serve to extend
the waiting period, and one comment requested that a mechanism to contest the extension be provided.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, some comments opposed the inability of the applicant to obtain work authorization during the appeal period
if his or her claim is denied by the immigration judge within the 180-day period. One comment noted that the applicant's
access to counsel will be jeopardized on appeal while another observed that negative decisions frequently are reversed.
A comment stated that such an applicant may face the choice of either starving or returning to a country where he or she
faces persecution. Comments also stated that a decrease in appeals will hinder proper interpretation of the law by
preventing the presentation of novel legal issues. These comments suggested that employment authorization be granted
to applicants during the appeal process or that an exception for economic necessity be provided.

Response and Disposition:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department strongly believes that the asylum process must be separated from the employment authorization process.
This rule will discourage applicants from filing meritless claims solely as a means to obtain employment authorization.
More important, the rule provides legitimate refugees with lawful employment authorization. When the system is
fully operational, asylum officers are expected to grant or refer affirmative claims within about 60 days. Thus,
persons with bona fide asylum claims would get work authorization in approximately the same time as the current 90-day
period for adjudicating work authorization applications. All applicants could have work authorization after 180
days, unless their claims have been denied by an immigration judge. Under existing authority, work authorization
may be granted to persons who are paroled into the United States by the INS. 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(11). This provision, which
can be employed in the case of asylum applicants seeking admission at a port of entry to the United States and paroled
into the country, is not changed in this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments presented on this issue have been carefully considered. Particular attention was given to the recommendations
that alternative means be established to adjudicate employment authorization on the basis of the merits of the claim
or on the economic situation of the asylum applicant. Either alternative would invite a large number of applications,
thus diverting resources and undermining the goals of asylum reform. Using a merit-based standard would require
the INS to adjudicate asylum applications for work authorization eligibility either through a paper evaluation
or a separate work authorization interview. A need-based standard would impose a similar administrative burden.
Given that the vast majority of those deserving asylum will promptly receive their decisions and, hence, their employment
authorization, this burden would not be justified by the results achieved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department also considered the claim that asylum applicants will disregard the law and work without authorization.
While this is possible, it also is true that unlawful employment is a phenomenon not limited to asylum applicants,
but is found among many categories of persons who have illegally entered or remained in the United States. The Department
does not believe that the solution to this problem is to loosen eligibility standards for employment authorization.
This is particularly so because of the evidence that many persons apply for asylum primarily as a means of being authorized
to work. These rules will discourage applications filed for such reasons and thus will enable the INS to more promptly
grant asylum_and provide work authorization_to those who merit this relief. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These provisions of the proposed rule also are in keeping with United States obligations under international law.
Article 17 of the 1951 Convention provides that a ``[c]ontracting State shall accord to refugees lawfully staying
in their territory the most favourable treatment accorded to nationals of a foreign country in the same circumstances,
as regards the right to engage in wage-earning employment.'' Under this rule, refugees_i.e., persons granted asylum_are
immediately eligible to apply for and receive employment authorization. Article 17 imposes no further obligations
on access to employment authorization for those who are applying for asylum. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department also has carefully considered the comments directed to the impact that new rules on employment authorization
would have upon the states. These concerns are addressed under heading 3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with its decision to remove the requirement for an asylum application fee, the Department will not adopt
in this final rule a requirement that asylum applicants pay a fee to accompany an initial application for employment
authorization under 8 CFR 274a.13. The fee requirement will be retained for applications to renew employment authorization.

The provisions of the proposed rule are adopted with several amendments in the final rule. Sections 208.3(c)(5) and
208.7(a)(1) of the final rule will be amended to provide that the 150-day period shall commence upon the receipt by
the INS of a complete application for asylum. The filing of an incomplete application shall not commence the 150-day
period provided that the INS has returned the application by mailing it within 30 days in accordance with 8 CFR 208.3(c)(5).
Section 208.7(a)(4) also will be amended to specify that an applicant's failure without good cause to appear for an
interview under section 208.9(a) precludes the applicant from receiving employment authorization under section
274a.12(c)(8). Failure to appear without good cause to receive the decision of the asylum officer under section 208.9(d)
shall be treated as delay caused by the applicant and shall toll the 150-day period. A new paragraph 208.7(a)(5) will
be added to specify that the new rules governing eligibility for employment authorization do not apply to persons
whose asylum applications have been filed prior to January 4, 1995. Finally, section 208.2(b) will be amended to state
that an immigration judge may permit a referred applicant to file an amended application, but that any delay caused
by such a request shall extend the period within which the applicant may not apply for employment authorization.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several comments criticized this proposal for placing an unfair and unnecessary burden upon applicants for renewal.
The comments stated that the INS should be able to process renewals within 60 days. Some comments stated that renewal
of work authorization should be assigned to INS District Offices, and not to the INS Service Centers, because the District
Offices are more likely to have access to information regarding the alien's status. One comment approved of the practice
of charging a fee for renewal of work authorization.

Response and Disposition:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under 8 CFR 274a.13(d), the INS district director shall adjudicate the application for renewal of employment authorization
within 90 days of receipt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The lack of uniformity between the current 60-day rule for filing renewal applications and the 90-day rule for adjudicating
such applications led to disagreements between applicants and the INS. The INS believes that fewer disputes will
result if these periods are uniform. The INS agrees that many such applications can be adjudicated in significantly
less than 90 days, and will continue to work for improvements in this area. Due to the workloads involved in processing
a large volume of employment authorization requests, however, the Department believes that it would not be prudent
to establish a shorter mandatory period for the adjudication of such requests. Accordingly, these provisions of
the proposed rule will be adopted without amendment in the final rule.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Proposed Rule:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Current regulations require that for each application for asylum within the jurisdiction of an asylum officer, an
interview shall be conducted by that officer. The proposed rule would provide that interviews on asylum applications
are discretionary.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Many comments opposed making interviews discretionary. Some rested their objections in part on constitutional
grounds; these concerns have been addressed above in subheading 2. The comments also expressed concern that direct
referral of claims without an interview to an immigration judge is inappropriate because the written application
often is not a reliable indicator of the strength or weakness of the applicant's claim. The comments argued that a system
of discretionary interviews and direct referrals would be unfair because many applicants are unable fully to articulate
their claim in writing due to language barriers, lack of understanding of the laws governing asylum, or innocent reliance
on unscrupulous paid preparers of asylum applications. These comments argued as well that the asylum interview is
of significant benefit because it allows the applicant to present the facts of the case in a nonadversarial manner
and compels the asylum officer to consider the full range of facts, including all relevant country conditions, before
making a determination in the case. While many comments acknowledged the advantages of adversarial proceedings
before an immigration judge in eliciting the facts of an asylum claim, the commentators generally felt that the value
of an asylum interview should be given greater weight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments stated that the proposed rule would be contrary to the legislative intent behind section 208 of the
Act, 8 U.S.C. 1158, because Congress contemplated that asylum determinations would be made independent of exclusion
and deportation proceedings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments claimed that the system of discretionary referrals would actually make the process less efficient
because applicants would be forced to present their claims in a longer, more formal hearing before an immigration
judge. The comments claimed that this would increase overall expense to the Government, exacerbate the problem of
delay in asylum adjudications, and undermine the intent of the proposed rule to streamline the asylum system.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The vast majority of the comments directed to this question stated that asylum interviews should be mandatory. However,
a large number of these comments also suggested that, as an alternative, direct referral without interview should
take place only in circumstances where the written application indicates that the claim is frivolous or manifestly
unfounded. Some comments criticized the proposed rule for making it appear that the granting of interviews to asylum
applicants will be the exception, not the rule. The comments also stated that applicants deserve to know the standard
under which the INS will determine whether or not to grant an interview.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response and Disposition:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has carefully considered these comments and determined that the goal of streamlining asylum adjudications
can be met without changing the present rule that mandates the opportunity for an interview of each asylum applicant.
Accordingly, the present rule is retained and there is no provision for immediate referral of cases, without an interview,
to an immigration judge. The rule is clarified to state that an interview will be granted for applications that are
complete within the meaning of &sect;208.3(c)(5). Section 208.10 also is amended to provide that the failure without
good cause of an applicant to appear for a scheduled interview under &sect;208.9(a) may be deemed to constitute a waiver
of the right to an interview with an asylum officer or, in the case of an applicant who is a stowaway, alien crewman, alien
temporarily excludable under section 235(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1225, or in current lawful immigration status, may
be deemed to constitute an abandonment of the application.

 The proposed rule would have amended 8 CFR 208.9 (b) and (c) to require the applicant to provide full identifying information
at the time of the application. Section 208.9(d) would have been amended to require that, at the conclusion of the interview,
the applicant be notified that he or she must appear in person to receive the written decision of the asylum officer.
A new section 208.9(g) would have been added to specify rules regarding the use of interpreters during interviews.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment stated that the proposed rule is unclear on whether witnesses could testify at the interview because section
208.9(b) of the rule states that the applicant ``may . . . submit affidavits of witnesses'' while section 208.9(g)
refers to live witnesses.

An asylum applicant may present live witness testimony at the time of his or her interview. In the final rule, section
208.9(b) is amended to clarify this point.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several comments criticized the requirement in the proposed rule that the applicant be informed that he or she must
appear in person to acknowledge receipt of the written decision of the asylum officer. The comments stated that this
requirement would be inefficient and would result in applicants having to make an unnecessary return trip to the Asylum
Office, where they may have to wait for a long period of time. A comment also questioned whether those who are interviewed
in ``circuit ride'' locations would be able to go to those locations, or would be required to travel to the more distant
Asylum Office with jurisdiction over their cases. Several comments suggested that written decisions be served by
certified mail or that mail service be used in cases where the applicant has an attorney or registered representative.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response and Disposition: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to streamline asylum adjudications, there must be a reliable system to accomplish and verify service of the
decision to grant, refer, or deny the claim and, if applicable, service of the charging document. The INS experience
with certified mail under the current rule demonstrates that this may not be the most effective method to meet this
goal. If the applicant has provided an invalid address or has moved without notifying the INS, delivery most often
will not be accomplished. In addition, postal delays and difficulties in processing return receipt cards detract
from the INS's ability to confirm timely delivery. It may be somewhat inconvenient to make a return trip to the Asylum
Office; however, under this system, the applicant will receive his or her decision promptly. If the decision is to
grant the claim, the applicant will be able to apply more quickly for employment authorization and other benefits.
If the decision is to refer the claim, the applicant will receive a charging document that will state the date and time
of required appearance in immigration court, and will be able to plan for that proceeding. Finally, both the asylum
adjudications and removal proceedings systems will benefit if there are fewer disputes regarding the service of
decisions and charging documents. In cases where the applicant has failed to appear at the appointed time to receive
his or her decision, certified mail will be used in lieu of personal service to deliver the decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The INS has carefully considered whether the rule should be amended to permit the use of mail service in the case of applicants
who have an attorney or registered representative. The Department has declined to adopt that proposal at this time,
chiefly because of concerns that an attorney retained for the asylum application process may not remain as the applicant's
attorney in exclusion or deportation proceedings. However, as this final rule is implemented, the INS will work with
attorneys and advocacy organizations to consider this and other proposals relating to service of decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These provisions of the proposed rule have been adopted with an amendment to clarify that an applicant's failure to
appear to receive and acknowledge receipt of the decision of the asylum officer shall be treated as delay caused by
the applicant for purposes of 8 CFR 208.7(a)(3) and shall extend the period within which the applicant may not apply
for employment authorization by the number of days until the applicant does appear to receive the decision or until
the applicant appears before an immigration judge in response to the issuance of a charging document under 8 CFR 208.14(b).

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several comments addressed the proposed rule's provisions governing the use of interpreters (8 CFR 208.9(g)). Some
comments criticized the requirement, also contained in current regulations, that the applicant who does not wish
to proceed in English provide an interpreter for the asylum interview. These comments stated that this will impose
a financial burden on applicants and that it may be difficult for applicants to find competent interpreters, particularly
for certain languages. Other comments recommended that the rule be amended to specifically permit immediate family
members to serve as interpreters. Some comments suggested that the rule be more lenient in cases where the applicant
has failed to provide an interpreter. One comment stated that the proposed rule should be amended to prohibit representatives,
as well as attorneys and immediate family members, from serving as interpreters.

Response and Disposition: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The requirement that asylum applicants wishing to proceed in a language other than English provide an interpreter
is currently enforced by the INS as an operations policy. Any other rule would impose an undue financial burden on the
Government. Currently, asylum applicants may use a family member, friend, or volunteer from the community, or may
hire a professional interpreter. The proposed rule was intended to adopt this policy into the regulations. The recommendation
that a registered representative, as well as an attorney, be prohibited from serving as an interpreter will be adopted
in the final rule; an advocate should not be called upon to serve two distinct roles in the course of a proceeding. However,
the final rule does not prohibit an employee of the applicant's attorney or registered representative, such as a paralegal,
from serving as the applicant's interpreter. Finally, while an applicant's failure without good cause to provide
an interpreter may be considered as a failure without good cause to appear for the asylum interview itself, the asylum
officer has discretion in applying this sanction. If the failure to provide an interpreter is justified by good cause,
the INS will not consider the applicant to have waived his or her right to an interview or to have abandoned his or her
asylum application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

These provisions of the proposed rule are retained with appropriate amendments in the final rule.

New Amendment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would have made no amendment to 8 CFR 208.10. However, in the course of reviewing the comments regarding
the interview of asylum applicants, it was concluded that this section should be clarified to modify the provision
that an applicant who fails to appear for a scheduled interview may be deemed to have abandoned his or her application
for asylum. The final rule will modify this section to provide that failure without good cause to appear for a scheduled
interview may be deemed to constitute a waiver of the right to an interview or, in the case of an alien crewman, stowaway,
person excludable under section 235(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1225, or person in current lawful immigration status,
may be deemed to constitute an abandonment of the application. The final rule also will amend 8 CFR 208.14(b) to provide
that an applicant who is deemed to have waived the right to his or her asylum interview in accordance with this section
may be referred to an immigration judge for adjudication in the course of exclusion or deportation proceedings.

Proposed Rule: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As amended by the proposed rule, 8 CFR 208.11 would retain the practice of submitting asylum applications to the Department
of State but would eliminate the mandatory period during which asylum officers and immigration judges must await
the receipt of State Department comments in individual cases. The State Department could provide such comments,
but the intent of the rule is to change the role of the State Department to one of providing detailed and current country
conditions information.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments supported this change. Several comments stated that applicants should have access to the country conditions
information provided by the State Department and relied upon by INS, and that applicants should continue to receive
copies of case-specific comments from the State Department. Some comments stated that the applicant should be given
30 days to respond to any such comments from the State Department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response and Disposition: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 208.11(c) of the rule, applicants will receive copies of case-specific comments provided by the Department
of State. Immigration judges will have discretion to grant an appropriate time period, if necessary, for rebuttal.
A uniform and mandatory waiting period will not be beneficial because it would add unnecessary delay to the process.
Copies of generic country conditions information relied upon by immigration judges also will become part of the record
available to the applicant. The INS currently is considering means by which country conditions information used
by asylum officers may be made more generally available and will continue to work with attorneys, advocacy groups,
and other interested members of the public in accomplishing this goal. This provision of the proposed rule is adopted
in the final rule with amendments to clarify the text and eliminate unnecessary words.

Proposed Rule: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule, section 208.12(a), would have eliminated the requirement that an asylum officer provide the applicant
an opportunity to inspect, explain, or rebut the material relied upon to find that the applicant's claim has not been
approved. This is commonly referred to as a Notice of Intent to Deny, or NOID.

Comments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many comments criticized this proposal, arguing that the NOID requirement protects the rights of applicants and
promotes more accurate decisions by asylum officers. Comments characterized the NOID as useful to clear up misunderstandings
or incorrect applications of the law before cases reach the immigration court. As discussed previously, some comments
also felt that the proposed rule would violate the due process rights of applicants by denying them an opportunity
to give a meaningful response to material other than the interview and the application relied upon by the asylum officer.

can respond.

Response and Disposition:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department gives high priority to all efforts to improve the fairness, quality, and accuracy of decisions made
by asylum officers and immigration judges. However, the requirements in 8 CFR 208.12(a) are not necessary to meet
these goals, and modification of this section is pivotal to the streamlining of the asylum process. Applicants who
are not granted asylum by the asylum officer will have a full opportunity to present their claim to an immigration judge,
with all the procedural protections of a full adversarial proceeding. This includes, of course, the right to examine
and rebut all evidence and materials that are introduced in opposition to the asylum claim. The NOID system is, at best,
an imperfect approximation of this hearing process and one that adds unnecessary time and expense to the process,
thus making it more difficult to adjudicate claims in a timely manner. The Department has considered seriously the
objections stated to this proposal but believes that the interests of all asylum applicants will best be served by
eliminating the NOID requirement. Accordingly, this provision of the proposed rule is retained without amendment
in the final rule. The Department will, however, continue to issue Notices of Intent to Deny in the cases of persons
whose asylum applications can be denied by asylum officers, including stowaways, crewmen, and persons with a lawful
immigration status.

and the applicant appears to be deportable or excludable, the asylum officer shall refer the application to an immigration
judge for adjudication in exclusion or deportation proceedings. The asylum officer would no longer deny the application
in writing, as required under current regulations. The asylum officer would issue a written denial in cases where
the applicant has a current legal immigration status not derived from his or her asylum application.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several comments stated that the rule should be amended to state specific guidelines that asylum officers must follow
in deciding whether to refer cases to an immigration judge. According to these comments, it is unclear whether the
application will be judged under the standard of well-founded fear of persecution set forth in section 101(a)(42)
of the Act, 8 U.S.C. &sect;1101(a)(42), or under some other discretionary standard. Some comments also stated that
asylum officers may rely on improper factors such as instinct, prejudice, or misinformation in making referral decisions.
The comments suggested that a written record of the reasons for referral, provided to the applicant, would be fairer
to applicants and would increase confidence in the referral system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments also criticized the provision for automatic referral of the asylum application to an immigration
judge. The comments argued that in the course of exclusion or deportation proceedings, the asylum application is
defensive in nature, and the applicant should be able to decide whether to use the application in the proceedings.
The comments also stated that initial asylum applications are often erroneous or incomplete, not because the applicant
intends to commit fraud, but because the applicant does not know English and has used a preparer who did not complete
the application correctly. The comments suggested that the applicant referred to an immigration judge be able to
submit an entirely new application.

Response and Disposition: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule does not change the legal standard for granting asylum set forth in sections 101(a)(42) and 208(a)
of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(42) and 1158(a), and 8 CFR 208.13 and 208.14: asylum officers will continue to abide by
this standard. Those who have met the burden of proof to establish that they are refugees will continue to be granted
asylum. Those who have not met their burden of proof will be referred to an immigration judge or, in the case of those
with a current lawful immigration status, will be issued a denial letter. The rule should create no reason for concern
that factors other than those set forth in the law and regulations will influence the decisions of asylum officers.
Accordingly, there is no reason to provide any additional regulatory guidelines for asylum officer decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have declined to adopt the recommendation that the applications of referred applicants not be forwarded to an immigration
judge. A referred applicant may decline to seek asylum in the course of exclusion or deportation proceedings and,
if so, can simply move to withdraw the application. However, if the applicant desires to proceed with the application,
he or she should be held accountable for the information that has been provided on the initial application. During
the immigration court proceedings, the applicant can provide additional information and explain any errors or inconsistencies
in the application. In addition, section 208.2(b) of this rule has been amended to provide that an immigration judge,
as a matter of discretion, may permit the applicant to amend the I&hyph;589 prior to the hearing on the merits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would have provided that the INS inform an applicant by letter of the decision to refer his or her case,
accompanied by a charging document. The INS will consider the recommendation that the letter state briefly the reasons
why the application has not been granted. However, the INS believes that a regulatory standard mandating the contents
of the referral letter is not necessary to preserve the procedural rights of applicants and may impede the flexibility
that will be necessary to ensure that applicants receive their decisions in a prompt manner. The INS will continue
to work with attorneys, advocacy groups, and other interested members of the public on this question. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This provision of the proposed rule will be adopted in the final rule with one substantive amendment. The amendment
will specify that an application may be referred to an immigration judge for adjudication in exclusion or deportation
proceedings if, in accordance with 8 CFR 208.10, the applicant is deemed to have waived his or her right to an interview
on the application under 8 CFR 208.9(a). In addition, this paragraph has been reorganized and sub-divided for clarity.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would have added a new paragraph 208.14(d)(4) that would bar individuals who have been convicted
of an aggravated felony from applying for or being granted asylum. Proposed 8 CFR 208.16(c)(2)(ii) would bar such
individuals from applying for or being granted withholding of deportation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several comments proposed that this portion of the rule be amended. Some comments stated that the effect of the rule
is too harsh and that those convicted of an aggravated felony should be able to present their asylum claims. The INS
should then balance the likelihood and seriousness of persecution against the gravity of the crime committed by the
individual. These comments stated that this approach is supported by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Some comments also argued that the rule should apply only to convictions entered after November 19, 1988, the date
of enactment of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100&hyph;690, which added section 101(a)(43) to the Act to
define ``aggravated felony.''

Several comments also criticized the proposed rule for barring persons with aggravated felony convictions from
eligibility for withholding of deportation. The comments argued that the preclusion in section 243(h)(2)(B) of
the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1253(h)(2)(B), which bars a grant of withholding to a person who, ``having been convicted of a particularly
serious crime, constitutes a danger to the community,'' requires a two-pronged finding: that the alien was convicted
of a particularly serious crime and that the alien constitutes a danger to the community. The comments stated that
the INS should not presume that every aggravated felony is a particularly serious crime or that every person convicted
of such a crime is also a danger to the community.

Response and Disposition:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 These provisions of the rule are mandated by the congressional enactments regarding limitations on the granting
of relief to criminal aliens. The definition of ``aggravated felony'' in section 101(a)(43) of the Act was added by
section 7342 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100&hyph;690, 102 Stat. 4181, 4469 (November 18, 1988). The
Immigration Act of 1990, Pub. L. 101&hyph;649, 104 Stat. 4978 (November 29, 1990) (1990 Act) defined additional crimes
as aggravated felonies and added further disabling provisions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
E.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1990 Act &sect;501, 104 Stat. at 5048. In addition, section 515(a)(1) of the 1990 Act created section 208(d) of the
Act, 8 U.S.C. 1158(d), which states that an alien convicted of an aggravated felony ``may not apply for or be granted
asylum.'' 104 Stat. at 5053. Section 515(a)(2) of the 1990 Act amended section 243(h)(2) of the Act, 8 USC 1253(h)(2),
to require that, for purposes of the statutory bar to withholding of deportation, ``an alien who has been convicted
of an aggravated felony shall be considered to have committed a particularly serious crime.'' 104 Stat. at 5053. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Neither section 208(d) nor section 243(h)(2) of the Act provides for a ``balancing test'' to be employed in the case
of a person convicted of an aggravated felony. Such a person is barred from relief without regard to the merits of his
or her claim. Inclusion of aggravated felonies as ``particularly serious crimes'' also is consistent with the long-standing
administrative interpretation of the Act that crimes such as armed robbery, robbery, burglary, embezzlement, and
possession for sale of cocaine and heroin are ``particularly serious crimes.'' Moreover, the Attorney General,
through the Board of Immigration Appeals, consistently has held that section 243(h)(2)(B) compels the finding that
an alien constitutes a danger to the community if he or she has been convicted of a particularly serious crime.

 114 S.Ct. at 1496. In enacting section 7342 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, Congress defined certain crimes as aggravated
felonies without regard to the date of conviction. Section 515(b) of the 1990 Act was amended by the Miscellaneous
and Technical Immigration and Naturalization Amendments of 1991, Pub. L. 102&hyph;232, December 12, 1991, 105 Stat.
1733, 1752, to mandate that the statutory bar in section 208(d) of the Act applies to convictions entered before, on,
or after November 29, 1990, the effective date of the 1990 Act, and applies to all applications for asylum made on or
after the same date. Congress also expressly limited the application of certain disabling provisions (e.g., the
deportation ground under section 241(a)(4) of the Act and the ineligibility for voluntary departure under section
244(e) of the Act), to an alien ``convicted, on or after the date of enactment of [the 1988] Act, of an aggravated felony.''
Pub. L. 100&hyph;690 &sect;&sect;7343(c) and 7344(b), 102 Stat. at 4470, 4471. If the term ``aggravated felony''
were to be interpreted to apply only to convictions occurring on or after November 18, 1988, then the prospective language
that placed limits on the retroactivity of specific sections of the 1988 Act would be redundant, in violation of the
maxim that no provision of a law should be construed to render a word or clause surplus.

It is clear that Congress intended to prohibit an alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony from applying

without amendment in the final rule.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Proposed Rule:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed rule would have added a new section 208.14(e) to provide that an applicant who is otherwise eligible may
be denied asylum in the discretion of the Attorney General if the applicant can and will be deported or returned to a
country in which the applicant would not face harm or persecution and would have access to a full and fair asylum procedure,
in accordance with bilateral or multilateral arrangements with the United States governing such matters.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A few comments endorsed this proposal. One comment noted that the proposed rule would prevent ``country shopping''
and encourage potential refugees to seek protection in the first country of refuge. Another comment agreed that the
proposed rule will be beneficial, provided that a treaty or other formal agreement designate the ``safe country.''
Another comment recommended that the proposed rule be amended to prohibit an asylum application from a person applying
for admission at a Port of Entry and who departed for the United States or is coming from a country which is signatory
to either the 1951 Convention or the 1967 United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, and in which the
alien would not face harm or persecution and would have access to a full and fair procedure for determining his or her
asylum claim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, most comments opposed giving asylum officers and immigration judges the authority to deny asylum as a matter
of discretion on this ground to an otherwise qualified applicant. Several comments claimed that these provisions
do not establish acceptable standards for refugee safety or due process in the receiving country, and thus do not fulfill
the requirements for a proposed rule under the Administrative Procedure Act. Another comment warned that the ability
to determine what is a fair procedure for asylum should not be left to the discretion of governmental agencies where
political considerations may play a large role.

A number of comments stated that refugees have the right to seek protection in the country of choice and that many asylum-seekers
choose the United States because the countries through which they travel do not offer adequate protection from discrimination
or home-country persecutors. Comments also argued that applicants may be deported to a country in which they had never
been present. Furthermore, courts have held that an asylum-seeker may not be deported to a third country where there
are no assurances that the asylum seeker would not be indirectly returned to the persecuting country, citing

his or her country of origin, which might endanger the applicant or the applicant's family. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other comments questioned how the United States would ascertain that the asylee would be protected in the ``safe country.''
One comment advocated that a careful and open review be conducted to determine that procedures in the designated first
country of asylum are carried out in the same manner and with the same safeguards as asylum determinations made within
the United States. In addition, this commenter suggested, there should be verifiable assurances that the denied
applicant will be treated by the ``safe country'' in a manner consistent with United States legal obligations. Other
comments expressed the opinion that a ``safe country'' may forcibly repatriate an asylee to the country of persecution
or that the asylee will be transferred from country to country. Several comments stated that current rules regarding
``firm resettlement'' adequately prevent forum shopping. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other comments recommended modifications to the proposed rule. One comment advocated that additional factors such
as the presence of family members in the United States, the applicant's ties (if any) to the receiving country, and
whether the applicant has a criminal record, be used to determine whether or not to exercise the discretion to deny.
Another comment stated that only immigration judges should be authorized to deny asylum under the proposed rule because
only they have the power to order aliens deported.

Response and Disposition:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 These comments have been considered carefully. It must be emphasized that the discretionary authority referred
to in this provision is contingent upon bilateral or multilateral agreements with other nations, and that no such
agreements now exist. In the absence of such agreements, discretionary authority under this section cannot be exercised.
Prior to the implementation of any such agreement by the Department, public notice will be provided. The Department
is satisfied that the basic standard set forth in this section is sufficient to protect the rights and interests of
persons entitled to protection from persecution in the event that the United States enters such an agreement. In the
meantime, most of the concerns presented in the comments relate to how the discretionary authority would be exercised.
These concerns and others will be taken into account if and when a bilateral or multilateral agreement on this subject
is made. This provision is retained in the final rule with an amendment to clarify that the alien may be returned only
to a country through which the alien actually traveled en route to the United States.

A comment stated that an asylee should not be required to apply for an EAD, but should be issued an EAD along with notification
of the asylum decision.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response and Disposition: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendments to section 208.20 are designed to ensure that asylees receive their EAD promptly upon application.
They do not create new requirements or obstacles for asylees seeking authorization to work. Asylees are among the
categories of persons who are eligible for employment incident to their status but must nevertheless apply for an
employment authorization document. 8 CFR 274a.12(a)(5). Among others in this category are those aliens who are admitted
as refugees, granted withholding of deportation, or granted Temporary Protected Status. Since authorization for
employment is a discretionary immigration benefit, the INS will continue to require that persons in these categories
file a separate application for an EAD. Accordingly, this provision of the proposed rule will be retained in the final
rule with an amendment for clarity.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Proposed Rule: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These provisions require that in the case of an alien in exclusion or deportation proceedings who expresses a fear
of harm or persecution upon return to his or her country of origin or country of deportation, the immigration judge
shall advise the alien that he or she may apply for asylum or withholding of deportation and shall make available the
appropriate application forms. The proposed rule would have amended these provisions to exempt situations where
the alien already has filed an asylum application and that application has been referred to the immigration judge
in accordance with the proposed amendments to 8 CFR 208.14(b).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several comments, all of which also criticized the direct referral of asylum applications under 8 CFR 208.14(b),
stated that there should be no exception for situations where an asylum applicant has been referred to an immigration
judge. The comments argued that as a result of this change, referred asylum applicants will receive less procedural
protection than other persons in removal proceedings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response and Disposition: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These changes do not deny any substantive procedural protection to asylum applicants. An applicant referred under
8 CFR 208.14(b) already has made an application for asylum, and thus need not be advised of a right he or she has exercised.
Referred applicants will enjoy all the procedural rights accorded to other persons in proceedings before an immigration
judge. Accordingly, these provisions of the proposed rule are adopted in the final rule, with section 236.3(a) amended
for clarity.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would have amended section 242.17(e) to expressly permit the INS to use information supplied in
an application for asylum as the basis for issuance of an Order to Show Cause under 8 CFR 242.1 and thus initiate deportation
proceedings.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few comments criticized this amendment, stating that it violates confidentiality by exposing the claims of applicants
in immigration court and violates due process by shifting the burden of proof to establish deportability away from
the INS. The comments stated that this subsection would be an obstacle to the right to apply for asylum because if the
applicant's claim is denied, he or she faces immediate deportation based on evidence provided in the application.
Some deserving applicants will avoid this risk and choose not to apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response and Disposition: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This aspect of the proposed rule is necessary to promptly refer cases to an immigration judge for decision. Often,
the asylum application is the only source of information available to the Service to initiate proceedings before
the immigration judge. Persons who choose not to file asylum applications for this reason may forego their opportunity
for consideration of their claim by an asylum officer; if they are apprehended by the INS and placed directly in proceedings,
the immigration judge will have exclusive jurisdiction over their cases. Immigration regulations need not be designed
to protect the ability of a person to remain unlawfully in the United States without detection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the advice of the public, this provision will be amended for clarity to provide that it applies to applications for
asylum or withholding of deportation filed on or after January 4, 1995.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule will further amend section 242.17(e) to state that an application made under section 242.17 may constitute
an admission of alienage or deportability if the alien has been properly served with notice of the hearing before an
immigration judge even in cases in which the applicant has failed without excuse to appear for the hearing. This amendment
is necessary to enable the entry of orders of deportation against aliens who are not lawfully present in the United
States, have been properly served with an Order to Show Cause, and fail to appear for their hearing.

Proposed Rule:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would eliminate 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(13), which provides that a person in exclusion or deportation

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several comments opposed this change on the ground that persons in deportation proceedings who have filed no applications
for relief, but who contest their exclusion or deportation on other grounds, will have no other basis to obtain employment
authorization and support themselves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response and Disposition:

As stated in the supplementary information to the proposed rule, virtually all persons who are not detained and are
subject to exclusion or deportation proceedings are eligible to apply for employment authorization under other
provisions of 8 CFR 274.12(c). Retaining this paragraph would be inconsistent with the intent of this rule to limit
access to employment authorization to asylum applicants whose cases are granted or whose cases are not decided promptly.
Accordingly, this portion of the proposed rule is adopted without amendment in the final rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would have amended section 274a.13 to provide that an applicant for employment authorization under
section 274a.12(c)(8) (relating to asylum applicants) must pay a fee upon both the initial application and applications
for renewal of work authorization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Numerous comments criticized the proposal for imposing a filing fee upon asylum applicants. These comments are summarized
under heading 4. We consider these comments to be directed as well to the proposal to charge a filing fee for initial
applications for employment authorization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response and Disposition: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has determined that the final rule will require payment of a fee only upon application for replacement
or renewal of an employment authorization document. This is consistent with the decision not to charge a fee for the
filing of an application for asylum. It also is reasonable to charge a renewal fee to those who have previously been
granted employment authorization. As part of an ongoing comprehensive economic analysis of its entire fee structure,
the INS will examine alternative sources of funding for employment authorization adjudications, including the
possibility of a user fee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Attorney General certifies that this rule will not have a significant adverse
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, based upon the following factors. This rule principally
affects the adjudication of individual claims for asylum and withholding of deportation and thus would have no significant
economic impact on small businesses, organizations, or state or local governmental agencies. The amendments to
regulations concerning the issuance and renewal of employment authorization documents could have a small and indirect
impact upon business entities by withholding employment authorization in certain cases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of Justice considers this rule to be a ``significant regulatory action'' under section 3(f) of Executive
Order 12866, and accordingly submitted this rule to the Office of Management and Budget for review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule will not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between the national
government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism
implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Attorney General has reviewed this rule in light of section 2(c) of Executive Order 12778 and finds that the rule
meets the applicable standards provided in section 2(b) of the order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information collection requirements contained in this rule have been submitted to the Office of Management and
Budget under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act. Clearance numbers for these collections are contained
in 8 CFR 299.5, Display of Control Numbers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim rule's amendments to 8 CFR 208.3(a) and 208.4(a) are superseded by amendments made by this final rule.
The interim rule's amendments to 8 CFR 208.4(b) are adopted without amendment as part of this final rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) (1) An applicant for asylum who has not been convicted of an aggravated felony shall be eligible pursuant to &sect;&sect;274a.12(c)(8)
and 274a.13(a) of this chapter to submit an Application for Employment Authorization (Form I&hyph;765). The application
shall be submitted no earlier than 150 days after the date on which a complete application for asylum submitted in accordance
with &sect;&sect;208.3 and 208.4 of this part has been received. If an application for asylum has been returned as
incomplete in accordance with &sect;208.3(c)(5), the 150-day period will commence upon receipt by the INS of a complete
application for asylum. An applicant whose application for asylum has been denied by an asylum officer or by an immigration
judge within the 150-day period shall not be eligible to apply for employment authorization. After the expiration
of the 150-day period, the INS shall have 30 days from the date of filing of an initial application for employment authorization
to grant or deny that application. If the INS fails to adjudicate the asylum application within that period, the alien
shall be eligible for interim employment authorization under this chapter. If an application for asylum is denied
by an immigration judge or an asylum officer within the 30-day period, but prior to a decision on the application for
employment authorization, the application for employment authorization shall be denied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An applicant who has been convicted of an aggravated felony shall not be granted employment authorization. In
cases where an applicant has previously received employment authorization and his or her application for asylum
or withholding of deportation is denied because the applicant has been convicted of an aggravated felony, the employment
authorization shall terminate as of the date of the denial. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For purposes of this paragraph (a), the time periods within which the alien may not apply for employment authorization
and within which the INS must respond to any such application shall begin when the alien has filed a complete asylum
application in accordance with &sect;&sect;208.3 and 208.4. Any delay requested or caused by the applicant shall
not be counted as part of these time periods. Such time periods also shall be extended by the equivalent of the time between
issuance of a request for evidence under &sect;103.2(b)(8) of this chapter and the receipt of the applicant's response
to such request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) An applicant who fails without good cause to appear for a scheduled interview before an asylum officer or a hearing
before an immigration judge shall not be granted employment authorization pursuant to &sect;274a.12(c)(8) of this
chapter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The provisions of paragraphs (a) (1), (3), and (4) of this section shall apply to persons who have filed an application

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Subject to the restrictions in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, employment authorization shall be renewable,
in increments to be determined by the Commissioner, for the continuous period of time necessary for the asylum officer
or immigration judge to decide the asylum application and, if necessary, for final adjudication of any administrative
or judicial review.

(a) For each application for asylum or withholding of deportation that is complete within the meaning of &sect;208.3(c)(5)
and that is within the jurisdiction of the Office of Refugees, Asylum, and Parole, an interview shall be conducted
by an asylum officer, either at the time of the application or at a later date to be determined by the Asylum Office. Applications
within the jurisdiction of an immigration judge are to be adjudicated under the rules of procedure established by
the Executive Office for Immigration Review in parts 3, 236, and 242 of this chapter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The asylum officer shall conduct the interview in a nonadversarial manner and, at the request of the applicant,
separate and apart from the general public. The purpose of the interview shall be to elicit all relevant and useful
information bearing on the applicant's eligibility for the form of relief sought. At the time of the interview, the
applicant must provide complete information regarding his or her identity, including name, date and place of birth,
and nationality, and may be required to register this identity electronically or through any other means designated
by the Attorney General. The applicant may have counsel or a representative present, may present witnesses, and may
submit affidavits of witnesses and other evidence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The asylum officer shall have authority to administer oaths, verify the identity of the applicant (including

(d) Upon completion of the interview, the applicant or his representative shall have an opportunity to make a statement
or comment on the evidence presented. The asylum officer, in his or her discretion, may limit the length of such statement
or comment and may require their submission in writing. Upon completion of the interview, the applicant shall be informed
that he or she must appear in person to receive and to acknowledge receipt of the decision of the asylum officer and any
other accompanying material at a time and place designated by the asylum officer. An applicant's failure to appear
to receive and acknowledge receipt of the decision shall be treated as delay caused by the applicant for purposes of
&sect;208.7(a)(3) and shall extend the period within which the applicant may not apply for employment authorization
by the number of days until the applicant does appear to receive and acknowledge receipt of the decision or until the
applicant appears before an immigration judge in response to the issuance of a charging document under &sect;208.14(b).

(e) The asylum officer shall consider evidence submitted by the applicant together with his or her asylum application,

officer may grant the applicant a brief extension of time following an interview during which the applicant may submit
additional evidence. Any such extension shall extend by equivalent time the periods specified by &sect;208.7 for
the filing and adjudication of employment authorization applications.

behalf may serve as the applicant's interpreter. Failure without good cause to comply with this paragraph may be considered
a failure without good cause to appear for the interview for purposes of &sect;208.10.

Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992, 12 U.S.C. 4501 et seq., established the Office of Federal
Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) as an independent office within the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
The primary function of OFHEO is to ensure the financial safety and soundness and the capital adequacy of the nation's
two largest housing finance institutions_the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corporation. This document establishes the regulations of OFHEO in title 12, chapter XVII of the Code of Federal Regulations.
These regulations delineate the origination of OFHEO, the duties and functions of its Director, and the organization
and functions of OFHEO's various offices.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In acting on the regulations, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight finds that notice and public comment
are unnecessary. Section 553(b)(A) of title 5, United States Code, provides that when regulations involve matters
of agency organization, procedure or practice, the agency may publish regulations in final form. In addition, OFHEO
finds, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(d), that a delayed effective date is unnecessary. Accordingly, these regulations
are effective upon publication.

The final rule applies only to agency internal organization and functions. It will not affect the states, the relationship
between the national government and the states, or the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various
levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule
will not have federalism implications that warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain Short Brothers Model SD3&hyph;60 series airplanes, that requires installation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain time delay relay and associated wiring into a circuit of the rudder gust lock. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendment is prompted by reports of inadvertent engagements of the rudder gust lock on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in-service Model SD3&hyph;60 series airplanes. The actions specified by this AD are intended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to prevent premature locking of the rudder gust lock, which could result in reduced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controllability of the airplane in flight and during landing roll.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to certain Short Brothers Model SD3&hyph;60 series airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 17, 1994 (59 FR 42186). That action proposed to require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installation of a 10-second time delay relay, having part number TDD&hyph;AYOF&hyph;1002, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated wiring into a circuit of the rudder gust lock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this amendment. No comments were submitted in response to the proposal or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA's determination of the cost to the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of America, the FAA has learned that, in general, some operators may misunderstand the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability provision of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. Under these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances, at least one operator appears to have incorrectly assumed that its airplane 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was not subject to an AD. On the contrary, all airplanes identified in the applicability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision of an AD are legally subject to the AD. If an airplane has been altered or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repaired in the affected area in such a way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or operator is required to obtain FAA approval for an alternative method of compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the AD, in accordance with the paragraph of each AD that provides for such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approvals. A note has been added to this final rule to clarify this requirement. The FAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has determined that this addition will neither increase the economic burden on any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 88 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it will take approximately 29 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. Required parts will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to the operators. Based on these figures, the total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $153,120, or $1,740 per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Raytheon Corporate Jets Model BAe 125&hyph;1000A
and Hawker 1000 series airplanes, that requires installation of additional vent areas in the central fuselage. This
amendment is prompted by an analysis which indicated that an explosive decompression could not be vented adequately
with the currently installed floor venting system on these airplanes. The actions specified by this AD are intended
to prevent collapse of the floor and subsequent injury to passengers and crew in the event of an explosive decompression
of the fuselage.

As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, the FAA has learned that,
in general, some operators may misunderstand the legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability
provision of the AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. Under these circumstances,
at least one operator appears to have incorrectly assumed that its airplane was not subject to an AD. On the contrary,
all airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally subject to the AD. If an airplane has been
altered or repaired in the affected area in such a way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required
to obtain FAA approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the paragraph of each
AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been added to this final rule to clarify this requirement. The FAA has
determined that this addition will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of
the AD.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA estimates that 19 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 34
work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. Based
on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $38,760, or $2,040 per airplane.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

applicability provision, regardless of whether it has been modified, altered, or repaired in the area subject to
the requirements of this AD. For airplanes that have been modified, altered, or repaired so that the performance of
the requirements of this AD is affected, the owner/operator must use the authority provided in paragraph (b) to request
approval from the FAA. This approval may address either no action, if the current configuration eliminates the unsafe
condition; or different actions necessary to address the unsafe condition described in this AD. Such a request should
include an assessment of the effect of the changed configuration on the unsafe condition addressed by this AD. In no
case does the presence of any modification, alteration, or repair remove any airplane from the applicability of this
AD.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all Raytheon Corporate Jets Model BH/HS 125&hyph;600A and &hyph;700A series airplanes, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires installation of two new circuit breakers in the 6 volt output circuits of the flight 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deck lighting transformers on electrical Panel `RY,' below the right pilot's seat. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendment is prompted by a report of smoke in the flight deck due to a lighting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transformer 6 volt output circuit short circuiting to ground. The actions specified by this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AD are intended to prevent smoke or fire in the flight deck due to inadequate circuit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection for 6 volt circuits of the flight deck lighting transformer.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to all Raytheon Corporate Jets Model BH/HS 125&hyph;600A and &hyph;700A series 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 27, 1994 (59 FR 38143). That 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action proposed to require installation of two new circuit breakers in the 6 volt output 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circuits of the flight deck lighting transformers on electrical Panel `RY,' below the right 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pilot's seat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this amendment. No comments were submitted in response to the proposal or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA's determination of the cost to the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of America, the FAA has learned that, in general, some operators may misunderstand the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability provision of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. Under these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances, at least one operator appears to have incorrectly assumed that its airplane 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was not subject to an AD. On the contrary, all airplanes identified in the applicability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision of an AD are legally subject to the AD. If an airplane has been altered or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repaired in the affected area in such a way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or operator is required to obtain FAA approval for an alternative method of compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the AD, in accordance with the paragraph of each AD that provides for such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approvals. A note has been added to this final rule to clarify this requirement. The FAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has determined that this addition will neither increase the economic burden on any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 202 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it will take approximately 10 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. Required parts will cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately $500 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on U.S. operators is estimated to be $222,200, or $1,100 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 This action amends the Fanning Field, Idaho Falls, ID, Class D airspace from full-time to part-time operations. Recent
staffing reductions, and reduced aeronautical activity, have reduced the need for full-time operations at the airport
traffic control tower (ATCT). The information will be published in the Airport/Facility Directory for pilot reference.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

History
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On August 23, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) by modifying
the Class D airspace area at Fanning Field, Idaho Falls, ID (59 FR 43311). Decreased aeronautical operations and reduced
FAA staffing have required elimination of the midnight shift schedule at the ATCT.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on
the proposal to the FAA. No comments were received. Class D airspace areas extending upward from the surface of the
earth are published in paragraph 5000 of FAA Order 7400.9B, dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994,
which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The airspace listed in this document will be published subsequently
in the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) amends the Class D airspace at Fanning
Field, Idaho Falls, ID, by providing information regarding part-time operations at the ATCT.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. Therefore, this regulation_(1)
if not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

The FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) on June 3, 1993, to amend the Class
D airspace for the Buckley ANG Base at Aurora, Colorado (58 FR 31486). Interested parties were invited to participate
in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments were received.
On September 9, 1993, the FAA published a final rule amending Class D airspace (58 FR 47371). On June 20, 1994, the Federal
Aviation Administration published another final rule which withdrew previous establishment of controlled airspace
for the Buckley ANG Base, Aurora, Colorado, because commissioning of the airport had again been delayed (59 FR 31518).
With the impending opening of a new International Airport at Denver, Colorado, there is a simultaneous requirement
to amend the airspace adjacent to Class B airspace, including the Buckley ANG Base airspace.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The coordinates are in North American Datum 83. Class D and Class E airspace designations are published in Paragraphs
5000, 6002, and 6004, respectively, of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which
is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class D and Class E airspace designations listed in this document will
be published subsequently in the Order.

Although this action is a final rule, and was not preceded by notice and public procedure, comments are invited on the
rule. This rule will become effective on the date specified in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 section. However, after the review of any comments and, if the FAA finds that further changes are appropriate, it will
initiate rulemaking proceedings to extend the effective date or to amend the regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments that provide the factual basis supporting the views and suggestions presented are particularly helpful
in evaluating the effects of the rule, and in determining whether additional rulemaking is required. Comments are
specifically invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, environmental, and energy-related aspects
of the rule which might suggest the need to modify the rule.

The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to 14 CFR part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations amends Class D airspace and establishes Class
E airspace at Aurora, Colorado, to correlate with the amendment and relocation of the Denver Class B airspace.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) establishes additional controlled
airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface of the earth deemed necessary by the FAA to contain aircraft
within controlled airspace while executing an existing published SIAP at the Kingston-Ulster Airport, Kingston,
NY. Additionally, the geographic position for Sky Park Airport, contained in the legal description for Class E airspace
at Red Hook, NY, is being updated to reflect the actual location of this airport.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Class E airspace designations for airspace extending from 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth are published
in paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9B, dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated
by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently
in the Order.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the circumstances presented, the FAA concludes that there is an immediate need to establish additional Class
E airspace at Kingston, NY, in order to promote the safe and efficient handling of air traffic in this area. Therefore,
I find that notice and public procedures under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and contrary to the public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which

This action revises the Class E airspace at Nacogdoches, TX. The development of a new localizer, Runway (RWY) 36, standard
instrument approach procedure (SIAP) and a new nondirectional radio beacon (NDB) RWY 18 SIAP has made this action
necessary. Controlled airspace extending upward from 700 feet above ground level (AGL) is needed for aircraft executing
these approaches. This action is intended to provide adequate Class E airspace for IFR operations for aircraft executing
the SIAP's at Nacogdoches, TX.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
History
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On December 17, 1993, a proposal to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to revise the Class
E airspace at Nacogdoches, TX, was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 65947). Two new SIAP's were developed for Nacogdoches, TX. The proposal was to revise the controlled airspace
extending upward from 700 feet AGL for instrument flight rules (IFR) operations in controlled airspace during portions
of the terminal operation and while transitioning between the enroute and terminal environments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on
the proposal to the FAA. No comments were received. However, since publication of the proposal, the FAA has discovered
that the proposed minutes in the longitudinal coordinate for the Nacogdoches, ILS Localizer are incorrect: the proposal
contained 12 minutes and it should have been 43 minutes. Further, the FAA has determined that the proposed reference
to the Lufkin VORTAC and the accompanying description of the airspace stating the radial and distances each side of
the radials are unnecessary. Therefore, the ILS Localizer coordinates have been corrected and the reference to the
Lufkin VORTAC and the affected portion of the accompanying airspace description have been removed from this final
rule. The FAA has determined that these changes will not increase the scope of the rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace areas designated as
airspace extending 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth are in paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9B, dated
June 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class E airspace
designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) revises the Class E airspace at Nacogdoches,
TX, to provide controlled airspace extending upward from 700 feet AGL for aircraft executing the SIAP's. This action
also corrects the geographic coordinates for the Nacogdoches RBN and corrects the airspace description by deleting
reference to the Lufkin VORTAC in the final description.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations that need
frequent and routine amendments to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory
action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated
impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation,
it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

This action establishes Class E airspace at Charlottesville, VA. Presently, this area is designated as Class D airspace
when the associated control tower is in operation. However, controlled airspace to the surface is needed when the
control tower located at this location is closed. The intended effect of this action is to provide adequate Class E
airspace for instrument flight rules (IFR) operations when the control tower is closed.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Although this action is a final rule, and was not preceded by notice and public procedure, comments are invited on the
rule. When the comment period ends, the FAA will use the comments submitted, together with other available information,
to review the regulation. This rule will become effective on the date specified in the DATES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 section. However, after the review of any comments, and if the FAA finds that further changes are appropriate, it will
initiate rulemaking proceedings to extend the effective date or to amend the regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments that provide the factual basis supporting the views and suggestions presented are particularly helpful
in evaluating the effects of the rule, and in determining whether additional rulemaking is required. Comments are
specifically invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, environmental, and energy-related aspects
of the rule which might suggest the need to modify the rule.

The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) establishes Class E airspace extending
upward from the surface at Charlottesville, VA. Currently, this airspace is designated as Class D when the associated
control tower is in operation. Nevertheless, controlled airspace to the surface is needed for IFR operations at Charlottesville-Albemarle
Airport, Charlottesville, VA when the control tower is closed. The intended effect of this action is to provide adequate
Class E airspace for IFR operations at this airport when the control tower is closed. As noted in the Airspace Reclassification
Final Rule, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 17, 1991, airspace at an airport with a part-time control tower should be designated as a Class D airspace
area when the control tower is in operation, and as a Class E airspace area when the control tower is closed (56 FR 65645).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace areas designated as
surface areas for airports are published in paragraph 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective
September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class E airspace designation listed in this
document will be published subsequently in the Order. Under the circumstances presented, the FAA concludes that
there is an immediate need to establish this Class E surface area in order to promote the safe and efficient handling
of air traffic in these areas. Therefore, I find that notice and public procedures under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable
and contrary to the public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 10, 1994, the FAA published a final rule (59 FR 40800) to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations
(14 CFR part 71) purporting to establish Class E airspace at Lyndonville, VT. The proposal was prompted by a review
of standard instrument approach procedures (SIAP's) for Caledonia County Airport which showed a need for controlled
airspace upward from 700 feet above the surface to contain instrument flight rules (IFR) operations at the airport.
The final rule described the action as establishing new controlled airspace. Since Class E airspace already existed
at Lyndonville, this action corrects references in the final rule to show that the final rule revises the description
of airspace already designated instead of establishing new controlled airspace.

History
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On June 28, 1994, the FAA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations
(14 CFR part 71) by amending the East Coast Low Control Area in the vicinity of Nantucket, MA. The proposal addressed
a need to more efficiently use the airspace in the vicinity of Nantucket Island by allowing aircraft executing the
Localizer Back Course Runway 6 instrument approach procedure at Nantucket Memorial Airport (ACK) to remain in controlled
airspace at lower altitudes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on
the proposal of the FAA. No comments on the proposal were received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Designations for Low Control Areas are published in Paragraph 6007 of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective
September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The amendment to the Offshore Airspace Area
designated in this document will be published subsequently in the Order
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations amends the East Coast Low Control Area in the vicinity
of Nantucket, MA. The effect of this action is to allow aircraft executing the Localizer Back Course Runway 6 Instrument
Approach at the Nantucket Memorial Airport, Nantucket, MA (ACK) to remain in controlled airspace at lower altitudes.
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore (1) is not a ``Significant
Regulatory Action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

By letter dated October 31, 1994 the London Metal Exchange (``LME) represented that it would be introducing an option
contract based on the LME Aluminum Alloy Futures Contract. The LME has requested that the Commission supplement its
Initial Order authorizing Option Contracts on High Grade Primary Aluminum, Copper-Grade A, Special High Grade Zinc,
Standard Lead, Primary Nickel and Tin futures contracts, 57 FR 38437 (Aug. 25, 1992), by also authorizing the Option
Contract on the LME Aluminum Alloy Futures Contract to be offered or sold to persons in the United States. Upon due consideration,
and for the reasons previously discussed in the initial Order, the Commission believes that the request for authorization
to offer or sell an option contract on the LME Aluminum Alloy Futures Contract should be granted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, pursuant to Commission rule 30.3(a) and the Commission's Initial Order issued on August 18, 1992, and
subject to the terms and conditions specified therein, the Commission hereby authorizes the Option Contract on the
LME Aluminum Alloy Futures Contract to be offered or sold to persons located in the United States thirty days after
publication of this notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, unless prior to that date the Commission receives any comments which may result in a determination to delay the effective
date of the Order pending review of such comments. Under such circumstances, the Commission will provide notice.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is correcting the regulations that require nutrition labeling on most foods
that are regulated by FDA. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of August 18, 1993 (58 FR 44063), the agency published a document entitled ``Food Labeling: Mandatory Status of Nutrition
Labeling and Nutrient Content Revision, Format for Nutrition Label; Technical Amendment.'' The document was published
with an inadvertent error in the amendatory language. This document corrects that error.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of August 18, 1993, FDA published a document that amended the regulations that require nutrition labeling on most
foods regulated by FDA. The agency intended to revise the introductory text of &sect;101.9(c)(1)(i) (21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)(i))
to specify that when either specific or general food factors are used in calculating caloric content, the factors
should be applied to actual amounts (i. e., before rounding) of food components. The agency inadvertently omitted
the words ``introductory text'' from amendatory statement 2 (58 FR 44076). Consequently, the actual methods for
calculating caloric content were removed from the Code of Federal Regulations. Accordingly, this document corrects
&sect;101.9(c)(1)(i) to restore the methods.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In a notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of July 23, 1991 (56 FR 33761), FDA announced that a food additive petition (FAP 1B4236) had been filed by Mitsui Petrochemical
Industries, Ltd., Kasumigaseki Bldg., P.O. Box 90, 2&hyph;5 Kasumigaseki 3-chome, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo 100, Japan.
The petition proposed that the food additive regulations in &sect;177.1345

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (21 CFR 177.1345) be amended to provide for the safe use of ethylene/1,3-phenylene oxyethylene isophthalate/terephthalate
copolymer in blends with polyethylene terephthalate polymers in contact with food.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has evaluated data in the petition and other relevant material. The agency concludes that the proposed use of the
food additive is safe and that the regulations in &sect;177.1345 should be amended as set forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with &sect;171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied
upon in reaching its decision to approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and
Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h),
the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure before making
the documents available for inspection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person who will be adversely affected by this regulation may at any time on or before January 4, 1995, file with the
Dockets Management Branch (address above) written objections thereto. Each objection shall be separately numbered,
and each numbered objection shall specify with particularity the provisions of the regulation to which objection
is made and the grounds for the objection. Each numbered objection on which a hearing is requested shall specifically
so state. Failure to request a hearing for any particular objection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing
on that objection. Each numbered objection for which a hearing is requested shall include a detailed description
and analysis of the specific factual information intended to be presented in support of the objection in the event
that a hearing is held. Failure to include such a description and analysis for any particular objection shall constitute
a waiver of the right to a hearing on the objection. Three copies of all documents shall be submitted and shall be identified
with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Any objections received in response to the
regulation may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In a notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of December 2, 1991 (56 FR 61253), FDA announced that a food additive petition (FAP 1B4283) had been filed by Ciba-Geigy
Corp., Seven Skyline Dr., Hawthorne, NY 10532&hyph;2188. The petition proposed that &sect;178.2010 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Antioxidants and/or stabilizers for polymers
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (21 CFR 178.2010) be amended to provide for the safe use of 2-methyl-4,6-bis[(octylthio)methyl]phenol as a stabilizer
in can-end and side seam cements and in various polymers intended for use in contact with food. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FDA has evaluated data in the petition and other relevant material. The agency concludes that the proposed food additive
use is safe, and that this use should be listed in &sect;178.2010, as set forth below. In addition, FDA is correcting
the entry for this additive in &sect;178.2010(b), in the table under the heading ``Substances'' to capitalize the
letter ``m'' in ``methyl.'' Thus, it will read ``2-Methyl-4,6-bis[(octylthio)methyl]phenol.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A review of the petition indicates that the additive may contain trace amounts of formaldehyde as an impurity. The
potential carcinogenicity of formaldehyde was reviewed by the Cancer Assessment Committee (the committee) that
has been formed by FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. The committee noted that for many years formaldehyde
has been known to be a carcinogen by the inhalation route, but it concluded that these inhalation studies are not appropriate
for assessing the potential carcinogenicity of formaldehyde in food. The committee reached its conclusion because
the route of administration was not relevant to food safety, and the fact that tumors were observed only locally at
the portal of entry (nasal turbinates). The agency has received literature reports of two drinking water studies
on formaldehyde: (1) A preliminary report of a carcinogenicity study purported to be positive by Soffritti et al.
(1989), conducted in Bologna, Italy (Ref. 1) and (2) a negative study by Til, et al. (1989), conducted in The Netherlands
(Ref. 2). The committee reviewed both studies and concluded in a ``Memorandum of Conference,'' dated April 24, 1991,
and March 4, 1993, ``* * * that data concerning the Soffritti study reported were unreliable and could not be used in
the assessment of the oral carcinogenicity of formaldehyde'' (Ref. 3). This conclusion is based on a lack of critical
details in the study, questionable histopathologic conclusions, and the use of unusual nomenclature to describe
the tumors. Thus, the committee concluded that there is no basis to find that formaldehyde is a carcinogen when ingested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with &sect;171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied
upon in reaching its decision to approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and
Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h),
the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure before making
the documents available for inspection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person who will be adversely affected by this regulation may at any time on or before January 4, 1995, file with the
Dockets Management Branch (address above) written objections thereto. Each objection shall be separately numbered,
and each numbered objection shall specify with particularity the provisions of the regulation to which objection
is made and the grounds for the objection. Each numbered objection on which a hearing is requested shall specifically
so state. Failure to request a hearing for any particular objection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing
on that objection. Each numbered objection for which a hearing is requested shall include a detailed description
and analysis of the specific factual information intended to be presented in support of the objection in the event
that a hearing is held. Failure to include such a description and analysis for any particular objection shall constitute
a waiver of the right to a hearing on the objection. Three copies of all documents shall be submitted and shall be identified
with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Any objections received in response to the
regulation may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Elanco Animal Health, Division of Eli Lilly and Co., Lilly Corporate Center, Indianapolis, IN 46285, has filed NADA
140&hyph;937. The NADA provides for use of separately approved 45 and 60 grams per pound (g/lb) monensin and 10, 25,
30, 40, 50, and 60 g/lb bacitracin methylene disalicylate Type A medicated articles to make Type C medicated feeds
containing 54 to 90 g per ton (g/t) monensin and 4 to 50 g/t bacitracin methylene disalicylate. The feed is used for the
prevention of coccidiosis caused by

, for increased rate of weight gain, and for improved feed efficiency in growing turkeys. The NADA is approved as of
November 8, 1994, and the regulations are amended in 21 CFR 558.355(f)(2) to reflect the approval. The basis for approval
is discussed in the freedom of information summary.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Certain limitations currently required on the monensin turkey feed labeling are not in the regulations. At this time,
FDA is adding these limitations to the regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the freedom of information provisions of 21 CFR part 20 and 21 CFR 514.11(e)(2)(ii), a summary of
safety and effectiveness data and information submitted to support approval of this application may be seen in the
Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville,
MD 20857, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(ii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b(c)(2)(F)(ii)), this
approval qualifies for 3 years of marketing exclusivity beginning November 8, 1994, because the application contains
reports of new clinical or field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) or human food safety
studies (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) essential to the approval and conducted or sponsored by the
applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(d)(1)(ii) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Postal Service published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 45652&hyph;45653) on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
September 2, 1994, a proposal to amend the Domestic Mail Manual to implement certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of Public Law 103&hyph;31, the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended title 39, United States Code, by adding section 3629. This section provides that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Postal Service shall make available to a state or local voting registration official the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate for any class of mail that is available to a qualified nonprofit organization under 39 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S.C. 3626 for making a mailing that the official certifies is required or authorized by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act. The mailing provisions of the law apply only to state or local voting registration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officials in those states and the District of Columbia that require a voter to register to vote 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before the date of voting in a general election for public office. This final rule adopts the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As information, the procedures that apply to voting registration officials seeking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorization and mailing privileges under the new provisions will be similar to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures that apply to nonprofit organizations mailing at the special rates. Voting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registration officials will not be permitted to mail at the special rates before receiving an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorization from the Postal Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each state and local voting registration official must submit PS Form 3624, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Application to Mail at Special Bulk Third-Class Rates, at each post office where materials 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be mailed at the special bulk third-class rates. After submitting an application, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
voting registration official may mail qualifying materials under a ``pending arrangement'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the postmaster. If the application is approved, the Postal Service will refund to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
voting registration official the difference in postage paid between the regular rates and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
special bulk third-class rates for mailings made after the effective date of the authorization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The authorization should be requested, and will be issued, by the title of the state or local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
voting registration official. After receiving authorization to mail at the special rates, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorized mailer may apply to mail at additional offices following the procedures in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Domestic Mail Manual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with all mail authorized at the special rates, only third-class matter, deposited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in prescribed minimum quantities and prepared in accordance with postal regulations, is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible for these rates. In addition to these general requirements, the materials must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required or authorized by the Act. Finally, mailers must complete and deposit with each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit imprint mailing the appropriate mailing statement: PS Form 3602&hyph;N, Statement of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mailing With Permit Imprint Third-Class Mail (Nonprofit Rates Only); PS Form 3602&hyph;PVN,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rates), with each metered or precanceled stamp mailing. The certification sections on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mailing statements will be modified as follows:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A total of 31 written comments were received, 30 from election and voting officials 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 1 from a member of Congress. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of these comments, 11 support the proposed regulations granting preferential rates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for voting materials, stating that the proposed changes will be workable for most voter registration officials.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The remaining 20 comments, although supporting the extension of special bulk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third-class rates to voting registration officials, seek an expansion of the types of matter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that those officials may mail at the special rates. Like other mailers eligible to use the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
special rates, voting registration officials would be permitted to enter only bulk third-class 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
matter at those rates. The commenters assert that the proposed rule would not result in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any real savings for voter registration mailings for these reasons: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The bulk rates are available only if the mailing contains 200 or more items 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sorted by ZIP Code; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Third-class mail has to be generic only and, therefore, may not contain any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
references to personal or unique information, as required in most mailings under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Voter Registration Act (NVRA); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Mailings under the NVRA are either single items of a First-Class nature mailed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in response to a registration application or ``forwardable'' mailings; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) All mailings required under the NVRA must be given First-Class service, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the rates would not apply to any ``return if undeliverable'' or ``forward'' action, which is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
essential to the NVRA mailings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, these 20 commenters urge that the Postal Service, in order to comply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the intent of Congress in the NVRA, do the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Amend the Domestic Mail Manual to permit registration materials to be mailed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First-Class at the special bulk third-class rates or some other rate that is lower than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regular First-Class; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Permit voting registration officials to use special bulk third-class rates for mailings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by the NVRA, regardless of the service requested or the quantity involved; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Help ensure citizen participation in the election process by providing special third-class rates for all official
registration mailings, lowering the number of pieces required for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NVRA mailings, and allowing voters to submit ballots and registration cards through the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mail at no expense. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the outset, the Postal Service notes that the eligibility for the special rates is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as restrictive as these commenters appear to believe. It is true that matter considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``actual and personal correspondence'' must be entered as First-Class Mail and not as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third-class mail. However, this requirement does not mean that matter entered at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
special rates must be generic and devoid of any items unique to the addressee. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instance, a mailpiece would not be disqualified ordinarily at the third-class rates for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inclusion of information typically on voting material such as an account number or file 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number, name and address of the addressee, the polling place, congressional district, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legislative district, school board district, councilmanic district, election district, and precinct. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(As a related example, library cards are generally eligible for third-class mail.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, although third-class mail generally must consist entirely of printed matter, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rather than handwritten or typewritten matter, the addition of a handwritten or typewritten 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
name and address is permitted. Questions about third-class eligibility of a particular piece 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be raised with local postal officials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The need for forwarding, return, or address correction services also would not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preclude the use of third-class mail. Although these services are not automatically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided for third-class mail, they can be obtained by adding the appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
endorsements to the mail. Extra postage is assessed only for pieces that require such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services. Election boards or voter registration commissions can minimize the volume of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pieces forwarded or returned either by using the National Change of Address (NCOA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system to maintain current address lists or by obtaining residential change-of-address 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information from PS Form 3575 as provided by Domestic Mail Manual A910.6.0. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Postal Service believes that the proposed rule requiring matter of voting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registration officials to meet the requirements that other mailers must meet to qualify for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the special bulk third-class rate is consistent with Public Law 103&hyph;31. That Act states that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Postal Service shall make available to a state or local voting registration official the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate for any class of mail that is available to a qualified nonprofit organization under 39 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S.C. 3626 for making a mailing that the official certifies is required or authorized by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act. Organizations authorized to mail at the special bulk third-class rates may mail only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their bulk third-class matter at those rates. Third-class mail consists of mailable matter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that weighs less than 16 ounces, is not mailed or required to be mailed as First-Class 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mail, and is not entered as second-class mail (except as permitted or required by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Postal Service, which believes that special bulk third-class rates are properly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chargeable for third-class matter and not other classes of mail, does not have the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unilateral authority to establish new postage rates or classes of mail. Classes of mail are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified in the Domestic Mail Classification Schedule (DMCS). Special bulk third-class 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates are available only to qualified organizations when their mailings consist of at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
200 pieces or 50 pounds of mail properly presorted. The minimum of 200 pieces or 50 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pounds was established because it is cost-effective for the Postal Service to verify, accept, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and process such mailings. The minimum-volume requirement is established in section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
300.021 of the DMCS, and the Postal Service may not change the requirements of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DMCS or change postage rates except by undertaking the procedures set forth in 39 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S.C. 3621&hyph;3625. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to its consistency with the language of 39 U.S.C. 3629, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination that the special rates be restricted to bulk third-class matter is also in line 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with subsequent legislative events. During 1993, the U.S. Senate introduced an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendment to the Treasury and the United States Postal Service Appropriations bill to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorize voting registration officials to mail at ``a rate which is one-half the applicable rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for First-Class Mail'' instead of mailing at the special bulk third-class rate as provided by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the NVRA, 139 Cong. Rec., S10186, August 3, 1993. The conferees deleted the Senate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendment, stating: ``The conferees are aware, however, of the concerns of some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
election officials who believe that the bulk third-class mail rate will not be sufficient to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include all of the mailing requirements of the Act.'' H.R. Rep. 102&hyph;256, 103d Cong., 1st 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sess., September 24, 1993, at 43. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Suggestions that the Postal Service permit voting materials to be mailed free or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopt a new rate for such mail, such as a percentage of the First-Class rate, are beyond 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the scope of the Act and outside the authority of the Postal Service. Free or reduced rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mailing privileges may not be adopted unilaterally by the Postal Service; they are effected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only by congressional statute. Other than 39 U.S.C. 3406 and 3629, Congress has not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enacted such privileges for election-related mailings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment noted that the Postal Service misinterpreted the law regarding applicability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the National Voter Registration Act by stating that the law applies only to states or local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
voting registration officials in those states and the District of Columbia that require a voter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to register to vote before the date of voting in a general election for public office. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter stated: ``Section 4 of the NVRA exempts states which had enacted a law on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or before March 11, 1993, which allows all voters to `register to vote at the polling place 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the time of voting in a general election for Federal office.' Any state that enacts an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
election-day registration law after March 11, 1993, will be subject to the provisions of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NVRA and, therefore, should be entitled to the preferential postal rates.'' The comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refers to information in the supplementary information section of the proposed rule, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reads as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The law (NVRA) applies only to state or local voting registration officials in those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
states and the District of Columbia that require a voter to register to vote before the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date of voting in a general election for public office.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three commenters expressed strong concerns about the procedures for obtaining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorizations to mail at the special rates. These commenters: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Opposed the requirement that the local voting registration official submit PS Form 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3624 at each post office where the official will mail materials at the special bulk third-class 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Suggested that PS Form 3624 be changed to indicate that the state or local voting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registration official is the applicant, to be consistent with the Act; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) Asserted that requiring the agency head to complete the application is an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unnecessary step in the application process because it would require Board of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Supervisors' action (``head of the agency'') and signature of the Chairman; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Argued that voter registration and voter list maintenance are entirely decentralized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in many states and controlled by local elected officials, the vast majority of whom have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no staff or office resources, and that imposing additional administrative requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bulk mail will eliminate the use of special bulk rates in counties and municipalities that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least able to afford the full rates; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Proposed that the ``Chief Election Official'' designated in accordance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NVRA of 1993 should be permitted to submit to the Postal Service the names of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registration offices and post offices where special bulk rates would be needed, or that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
state officials might file a request for all county and local officials to mail under the NVRA; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Suggested that the application be revised to require the applicant to submit only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relevant material to establish eligibility to mail at the special bulk third-class rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Postal laws have long required mailers to apply for authorization to mail at special 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bulk third-class rates before entering mail at the special rates. See former 39 U.S.C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4452(d). This application process ensures that only qualified mailers enter matter at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
special rates and that the matter entered is eligible. The Postal Service has no objections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to state and other officials providing advice and assistance to local voting registration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officials in qualifying to mail their materials at the special bulk third-class rates. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Postal Service will continue to require voting registration officials to obtain an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorization to mail at the special bulk third-class rates at the post office where the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officials will present matter for mailing at the special bulk third-class rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters appear to misunderstand the proposed procedure for applying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to mail at the special bulk third-class rates. The state or local voting registration official 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who will be presenting bulk third-class mailings will be required to apply to mail at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
special bulk third-class rates and will be considered the ``official head of the government 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency'' (voting registration official). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An organization authorized to mail at the special bulk third-class rates may mail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only its matter at those rates. The Postal Service is not requiring state officials to file 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requests for local voting registration officials to mail at the special bulk third-class rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, state officials may assist local voting registration officials in preparing their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications if the applications are submitted to the post office where the local voting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registration officials will make mailings at the special bulk third-class rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with the comments received, the Postal Service is also revising the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application form to reduce the burden on voting officials applying to mail at the special 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates. PS Form 3624, Application to Mail at Special Bulk Third-Class Rates, will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised so that election officials will have to supply only minimal information. The revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
form will be printed in the Postal Bulletin. The information required will be far less than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that required from nonprofit mailers seeking to mail at the special rates.

<SUPPLEM>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The rule is substantially the same as the interim rule with request for comments published on May 3, 1994. Commercial
Mail Receiving Agencies (CMRAs) are private entities which receive mail on behalf of other persons. An address provided
by a CMRA often appears to be a typical residential or business address. Both CMRAs and their customers are required
to sign Postal Service Form 1583, ``Application for Delivery of Mail Through Agent,'' a copy of which is filed with
the postmaster responsible for the delivery address. The Postal Service has prohibited the disclosure to the public
of any information contained on Form 1583. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As amended, 39 CFR 265.6(d)(8) authorizes disclosure of information from Form 1583 for the sole purpose of identifying
an address as belonging to a Commercial Mail Receiving Agency (CMRA). The regulation does not authorize the disclosure
of any other information concerning CMRAs or their customers. Because the regulation does not authorize the disclosure
of the identities of CMRA customers, disclosures under the regulation will not invade the legitimate privacy interests
of persons who receive mail through CMRAs. The information will be disclosed primarily by means of annotations to
the Postal Service's Delivery Sequence File (DSF). DSF data, the use of which is made available to the public through
authorized licensees, contains delivery-point addresses, and it does not include the identities of individuals.
Although disclosures will be made primarily by means of DSF annotations, the regulation permits disclosures by other
means. Regardless of the means of disclosure, all disclosures are limited in scope to the identification of an address
as a CMRA address. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copies of Form 1583 on file with the Postal Service are records protected by the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, and
they are maintained in the Postal Service's Privacy Act system of records USPS 010.050, Collection and Delivery Records_Delivery
of Mail Through Agents. The Postal Service has added a routine use to system of records USPS 010.050 which authorizes
the disclosure of the information that may be released pursuant to this rule. See 59 FR 22874 (May 3, 1994).

Analysis of Comments Received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two written comments were received. One commenter expressed support for the interim rule. The other commenter expressed
concern that the interim rule did not define the information which may be disclosed with sufficient specificity,
and also recommended that the rule be amended to authorize only disclosures by means of DSF annotations. An editorial
change to the interim rule has been made in response to these comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the commenter's concern that the information which may be disclosed was not defined with sufficient
specificity, the interim rule has been modified to emphasize that the only information which may be disclosed from
PS Form 1583 is the fact that an address is a CMRA address. This modification does not alter the substance of the interim
rule, which was never intended to authorize the disclosure of any other information.

For the following reasons, the Postal Service has decided not to adopt the commenter's recommendation that disclosures
be limited to DSF annotations. First, we think that a rule which limits the means, rather than the scope, of disclosure
would not significantly add to the protection of legitimate privacy interests. Once the information has been disclosed
through a DSF licensee, the Postal Service cannot prohibit or restrict the further disclosure of the information.
A rule limiting disclosures to those made through the DSF might create the appearance that the information will be
available only to persons who receive DSF data when, in fact, the information may be further disseminated by those
who receive it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, as we explained in the introductory comments to the interim rule, we have concluded that the identification
of CMRA addresses will be an effective tool in combatting credit card fraud and other types of consumer fraud. Limiting
disclosures to DSF annotations might impair the effectiveness of this tool by making the information more difficult
to obtain for persons, including law enforcement personnel, who may not have ready access to DSF data. Therefore,
we are adopting a rule that permits disclosure by means other than the DSF.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is taking final action to disapprove the Clean Air Act operating permits program under title V of the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990 submitted to EPA by the Commonwealth of Virginia. The reasons for this disapproval action were
fully described in EPA's notice of proposed disapproval (see the June 17, 1994

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) and can be summarized as follows: (1) Virginia's program submittal does not contain the necessary legal authority
to allow persons who have participated in the permit program's public comment process to obtain review of the final
permit decision in State court; (2) the program does not contain the necessary legal authority to prevent the default
issuance of permits; (3) the submitted regulations expired on June 28, 1994 and cannot be applied or enforced after
that date; (4) the regulatory portion of the program submittal does not include the proper universe of sources required
to be subject to a State operating permits program; and (5) the program does not ensure that permits contain all applicable
Clean Air Act requirements and does not correctly delineate permit provisions enforceable only by the Commonwealth.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Title V of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (sections 501&hyph;507 of the Clean Air Act (``CAA'')) and implementing
regulations at 40 CFR part 70 (see 57 FR 32250 (July 21, 1992)) require that States develop and submit operating permits
programs to EPA by November 15, 1993, and that EPA act to approve or disapprove each program within one (1) year after
receiving the submittal. EPA's program review occurs pursuant to section 502 of the CAA and the part 70 regulations,
which together outline the criteria for approval or disapproval. If EPA has not approved a program by November 15,
1995 for a State, it must establish and implement a Federal program in that State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On June 17, 1994, EPA proposed disapproval of the operating permits program for the Commonwealth of Virginia. (See
59 FR 31183.) EPA received public comment on the proposal and will address those comments in this notice. EPA is taking
final action to disapprove the operating permits program for the Commonwealth of Virginia. By promulgating this
disapproval action within one (1) year of receipt of Virginia's November 12, 1993 operating permits program submittal,
EPA has fulfilled its requirements for timely program review under section 502(d).

II. Analysis of State Submittal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 12, 1993, as supplemented on January 14, 1994, the Commonwealth of Virginia submitted an operating permits
program to satisfy the requirements of the CAA and 40 CFR part 70. EPA reviewed the program against the criteria for
approval and disapproval in section 502 of the CAA and the part 70 regulations. EPA determined, as fully described
in the notice of proposed disapproval of Virginia's program (see 59 FR 31183 (June 17, 1994)) and the Technical Support
Document for this action, that the Commonwealth's operating permits program does not substantially meet the requirements
of the CAA or part 70. In summary, the deficiencies of the Commonwealth's program which require disapproval are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Inadequate provisions, pursuant to section 502(b)(6) of the CAA and 40 CFR 70.4(b)(3)(x) and 70.7(h), for public
participation in the permit process and the opportunity for judicial review in State court. Specifically, the Commonwealth
lacks statutory authority for judicial review of final permit decisions that meets the CAA's minimum threshold for
judicial standing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Lack of authority, pursuant to section 505(b)(3) of the CAA and 40 CFR 70.8(e), to prevent the default issuance of
permits by Commonwealth. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The regulations to implement the program expired on June 28, 1994 and have not been re-promulgated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The Commonwealth's operating permits program does not require issuance of permits to the proper universe of sources
required by 40 CFR part 70. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The program does not contain regulations meeting the requirements of 40 CFR part 70 to ensure issuance of permits
that contain all applicable Federal requirements and to correctly delineate provisions only enforceable by the
Commonwealth. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to section 502(d)(1) of the CAA, the Commonwealth of Virginia must correct these deficiencies, as well as
those defined in the Technical Support Document by June 7, 1995, in order to receive approval of its operating permits
program from EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Response to Public Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA received 32 letters of comment in response to the proposed disapproval of Virginia's operating permits program
submittal. As mentioned in the June 17, 1994 notice of proposed disapproval, EPA received a petition from the Environmental
Defense Fund, dated December 23, 1993, to disapprove Virginia's operating permits program. That petition is considered
in this action. EPA received a total of 26 comment letters supporting the notice of proposed disapproval of Virginia's
program. EPA received adverse comment letters from the Virginia Manufacturers Association, Virginia Aggregates
Association, Northeast Maryland Waste Disposal Authority, AES, Ogden Martin Systems of Montgomery, Inc., Ogden
Martin Systems of Fairfax, Inc., Ogden Martin Systems of Lancaster, Inc., and Ogden Martin Systems of Alexandria/Arlington,
Inc. The Attorney General of Virginia submitted specific comments on the judicial standing issue. Additionally,
the Commonwealth of Virginia Department of Environmental Quality submitted a separate letter which describes how
it intends to address the deficiencies as outlined in the notice of proposed disapproval and the accompanying Technical
Support Document, with the notable exception of the judicial standing issues. Finally, one letter of comment was
received recommending specific changes to Virginia's operating permits program. The following is in response to
comments which do not directly support EPA's disapproval action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commonwealth of Virginia's judicial review statute is legally sufficient to satisfy the requirements of title
V and 40 CFR part 70. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
EPA Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA proposed disapproval of Virginia's program because it, in part, fails to meet the minimum requirements for standing
for judicial review as required by section 502(b)(6) of the Act and 40 CFR 70.4(b)(3)(x). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 502(b)(6) states that every permit program must provide the applicant and ``any person who participated
in the public comment process'' with the opportunity for judicial review of the final permit action in State court.
The same opportunity must also be afforded to any other person who could obtain judicial review of the action under
any applicable State law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commonwealth and the other contesting commenters assert that a reading of the language of section 502(b)(6) and
the legislative history indicates that Congress intended that States be given discretion to determine who should
be allowed to obtain judicial review of actions under a State's title V program. EPA does not agree with this interpretation
of section 502's judicial review provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that for a State title V operating permits program to be approved by EPA, that program must provide access
to judicial review to any party who participated in the public comment process and who at a minimum meets the threshold
standing requirements of Article III of the U.S. Constitution. This interpretation is consistent with the language,
structure, and legislative history of the Act which provides affected members of the public an opportunity for judicial
review of permit actions to ensure an adequate and meaningful opportunity for public participation in the permit
process. The Senate managers of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 stated that:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Several other provisions [in section 502(b)(6)] are included to ensure fair treatment in the permit process. For
example, we make clear that judicial review of final actions by the permitting authority to issue or deny permits shall
be available in State court to anyone who could obtain such review under any applicable law. This provision ensures
that existing provisions of law governing the availability of review of final actions on permit applications are
in no way limited, and that interested parties who arguably are affected by permit decisions are guaranteed their
day in court.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in 136 Cong. Rec. S169941 (daily ed. October 27, 1990). This language, together with the expansive language of section
502(b)(6), demonstrates the clear intent of the Congress to provide citizens a broad opportunity for judicial review.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, if EPA were to implement an operating permits program pursuant to section 502(d)(3) of the Act, citizens
would have access to judicial review of EPA permitting decisions if they met the minimal standing requirements of
Article III. With respect to the nature of the injury that an ``interested person'' must show to have standing under
Article III, the Supreme Court held in

Sierra Club v. Morton,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 405 U.S. 727, 734&hyph;35 (1972), that harm to an economic interest is not required to confer standing. Harm to an aesthetic,
environmental, or recreational interest is sufficient, as long as the party seeking judicial review is among the
injured. This holding was reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter observed that in addition to the constitutional requirements for standing, ``prudential'' standing
requirements would apply where a Federal court reviews an EPA-issued permit. The prudential standing inquiry requires
that a court ask whether a would-be challenger to Agency action is pursuing an ``interest'' arguably within the zone
of interests Congress intended to either regulate or protect.

that courts should apply traditional prudential standing requirements to parties seeking judicial review pursuant
to section 502(b)(6).

inter alia,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ``any person who participated in the public comment process'' on a proposed permit, Congress declared that any such
person is within the zone of interests addressed by title V. Thus, EPA believes that the Act clearly enables such persons
to meet prudential standing requirements. In Virginia, however, all persons who have participated in the public
comment process are not considered within the zone of interests protected by title V. Accordingly, the Commonwealth's
standing provision is more restrictive than traditional prudential standing requirements.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The CAA, specifically section 502(b)(6), may violate the Tenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The commenters
believe that Congress cannot preempt a traditional State power with the ambiguous language of section 502(b)(6)
and that Congress cannot coerce State legislative action. Additionally, these commenters contend that the sanctions
provisions in section 502(d)(2) of the Act unconstitutionally compel the States to enact and enforce the title V permits
program.

EPA Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commonwealth and the contesting commenters assert that EPA's interpretation of section 502(b)(6) of the Act
is an invasion of State sovereignty in violation of the Tenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. They assert that
Congress cannot require States to regulate. However, EPA does not believe that the Clean Air Act, and more specifically
section 502(b)(6), is an unconstitutional invasion of State sovereignty.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is fundamental under the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution that Congress lacks the power directly to compel
States to enact and enforce a Federal regulatory program. Equally fundamental, however, is Congress' authority
to establish a program of cooperative federalism in which States are encouraged to enact a State regulatory program
using Federal standards in a federally preemptible area. When Congress created the operating permits program in
title V of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, it could have entirely preempted State regulation by creating a regulatory
scheme to be enforced exclusively by EPA. Instead, Congress created a regulatory scheme where States could enact
permit programs meeting Federal standards or have EPA promulgate such a program. When Congress chooses to allow the
States such a regulatory role in a federally preemptible area, such as it has done in title V, the Supreme Court has found
no violation of the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and therefore no unconstitutional invasion of State
sovereignty.

 at 764&hyph;765. Rather, this program is clearly one of cooperative federalism that encourages the States to enact
and enforce a State program, incorporating title V's standards, by offering incentives to do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress can encourage States to regulate in a particular manner by attaching conditions on the receipt of Federal
funds and/or offering States the choice of regulating an activity in conformance with Federal standards or having
the State law preempted by Federal regulation.

 New York v. United States,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 112 S. Ct. 2408 (1992). Congress has provided States with two incentives to encourage them to adopt and implement an
operating permits program consistent with Federal regulations. If a State fails to submit an approvable program,
it is subject to one or more of the sanctions described under section 179(b) of the Act. Again, it is well established
that Congress is empowered to further Federal policy objectives by conditioning the receipt of Federal moneys upon
compliance by the recipient State with Federal statutory and administrative directives.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 448 U.S. 448 (1980). In addition, under section 502(d)(3), if a State does not submit a title V operating permits program
or if the State program does not meet the requirements of title V, EPA is required to promulgate, administer, and enforce
an operating permits program in that State. Thus, if the Commonwealth does not submit a permanent program that complies
with the Act and 40 CFR part 70, the full regulatory burden will be borne by EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commonwealth asserts that EPA's interpretation of section 502(b)(6) is a violation of the Eleventh Amendment
of the U.S. Constitution. Virginia's concern is misplaced because section 502(b)(6) provides for judicial review
of a State's permitting decisions in State court and therefore does not implicate the Eleventh Amendment.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commonwealth of Virginia should receive interim approval of its operating permits program. Several commenters
believe that Virginia's program will meet the minimum requirements to be considered for interim approval as described
at 40 CFR 70.4(d) once proposed modifications to the permits program regulations are adopted. It has also been stated
that the issue of judicial standing is not a relevant criterion for assessing interim approvability.

EPA Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to &sect;70.4(d)(1), an operating permits program submittal that is not fully approvable must first substantially
meet the requirements of part 70 in order to be considered for interim approval. Once a submittal has been deemed to
substantially meet the requirements of part 70, the criteria established at &sect;70.4(d)(3) are applied as a second
test for eligibility for interim approval. On the basis of the five disapproval issues, EPA has determined that Virginia's
operating permits program submittal does not substantially meet the requirements of part 70 and, therefore, is not
eligible for interim approval. Moreover, the fact that the emergency regulations establishing the permits program
have expired sufficiently indicates that the program does not substantially meet the requirements of part 70.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA judged the adequacy of the Commonwealth of Virginia's operating permits program prior to official submittal.
Specifically, EPA notified the Commonwealth of Virginia that it lacked adequate statutory provisions for standing
for judicial review prior to the receipt of its November 12, 1993 program submittal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

EPA Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA attempted to alert Virginia to potential impediments to the approval of any operating permits program submitted
by the Commonwealth prior to the November 15, 1993 program submittal due date. It was EPA's intention to supply constructive
comments to Virginia prior to November 15, 1993 in order to provide the Commonwealth with adequate time to seek any
statutory or regulatory revisions as needed. EPA has a well-established policy of providing comments on draft and
proposed regulations and programs which will later come before it for formal rulemaking action. Notwithstanding
EPA's policy of providing timely comment, the Agency's position on the standing for judicial review issue has been
consistent throughout its correspondence with the relevant parties in Virginia and that position has been maintained
and reflected in the rulemaking actions undertaken in response to the official submittal of Virginia's operating
permits program.

EPA may be applying inconsistent approval standards among the various State and Local jurisdictions seeking approval

EPA Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has applied consistent standards to other states. EPA has not proposed approval for any State operating permits
program that does not substantially meet the requirements for standing for judicial review as required by section
502(b)(6) of the Act and 40 CFR 70.4(b)(3)(x). EPA will evaluate each program separately to determine if it meets the
requirements of 40 CFR part 70.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commonwealth of Virginia Department of Environmental Quality submitted comments to address the regulatory
deficiencies cited in EPA's notice of proposed disapproval and the Technical Support Document accompanying that
action. The comments specifically exclude discussion of the standing for judicial review issue. The Department
of Environmental Quality details the regulatory modifications it plans to make to the previously adopted regulations
for its operating permits program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
EPA Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is encouraged that the Department of Environmental Quality is working to address the regulatory deficiencies
of its operating permits program as cited in the proposed disapproval. At such time that EPA receives an official submittal
replacing the Commonwealth's November 12, 1993 submittal being considered by this action, the Agency will evaluate
the new submittal in an additional rulemaking action. To comment on the adequacy of proposed modifications would
not be appropriate in this action.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter provided EPA with letters it had previously submitted to the Virginia Department of Environmental
Quality. The letters discuss the commenter's concerns regarding Virginia's operating permits program. The letters
also offer suggested modifications to the program. The commenter suggested that EPA consider these letters when
reviewing Virginia's program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has considered the comments contained in the letters provided by the commenter. EPA's final disapproval of the
Virginia operating permits program as submitted on November 12, 1993 sufficiently addresses the concerns of the

IV. Final Action and Implications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Program Modification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is promulgating disapproval of the operating permits program submitted by the Commonwealth of Virginia on November
12, 1993, as supplemented on January 14, 1994. This disapproval constitutes a disapproval under section 502(d) of
the CAA (see 57 FR 32253). Pursuant to section 502(d)(1), the Commonwealth has 180 days from the date of EPA's notification
of the Governor of Virginia to revise and resubmit the program. EPA will notify the Governor of Virginia by letter that
the Commonwealth has 180 days from the effective date of this final disapproval in which to make the necessary modifications
to its operating permits program and resubmit it to EPA for review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Virginia must amend its operating permits program to correct the deficiencies and resubmit the program, including
a revised Attorney General's opinion, to EPA for review. The notice of proposed disapproval and the Technical Support
Document discuss Virginia's submittal in detail, and contain specific references to revisions and modifications
necessary to obtain full approval. Once submitted, Virginia's operating permits program, including revised statutes
and regulations, will undergo an additional notice and comment period before EPA takes final action on the program
submittal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Sanctions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the disapproval of its operating permits program, the Commonwealth of Virginia may become subject to sanctions
under the CAA. Pursuant to section 502(d)(2)(A), EPA may, at its discretion, apply any of the sanctions described
in section 179(b) at any time subsequent to the effective date of this disapproval action. Furthermore, EPA is compelled
by the CAA to apply one of the sanctions in section 179(b), as selected by the Administrator, on July 5, 1996, unless
prior to that date the Commonwealth submits a revised operating permits program for Virginia and EPA determines that
the Commonwealth has corrected the deficiencies that prompted this disapproval action. If, six (6) months after
EPA applies the first sanction, Virginia has not submitted a revised program and EPA has not determined that the Commonwealth
has corrected the deficiencies, a second sanction is required. Finally, if the Commonwealth of Virginia does not
have an approved program by November 15, 1995, EPA must promulgate, administer, and enforce a Federal operating permits
program for Virginia.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Final Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is disapproving the operating permits program submitted by the Commonwealth of Virginia on November 12, 1993,
as supplemented on January 14, 1994. This disapproval constitutes a disapproval under section 502(d) of the CAA (see
57 FR 32253). As provided under section 502(d)(1) of the CAA, the Commonwealth will have up to 180 days from the date
of EPA's notification of disapproval for the Governor of Virginia to revise and resubmit the program. EPA is disapproving
this program on the basis that Virginia has not met the following five requirements: provision for adequate judicial
standing; prevention of default permit issuance; reliance on permanent regulations; issuance of permits to the
proper universe of sources; and issuance of permits that contain all applicable Federal requirements and correctly
delineate provisions only enforceable by the Commonwealth. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has exempted this action from Executive Order 12866 review.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA's actions under section 502 of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply address operating permits
programs submitted to satisfy the requirements of 40 CFR part 70. Because EPA's disapproval of the Commonwealth of
Virginia's request under section 502 of the CAA for approval of its operating permits program does not impose any new
requirements, it does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

with the floodplain management requirements of the program. If the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) receives
documentation that the community has adopted the required floodplain management measures prior to the effective
suspension date given in this rule, the suspension will be withdrawn by publication in the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NFIP enables property owners to purchase flood insurance which is generally not otherwise available. In return,
communities agree to adopt and administer local floodplain management aimed at protecting lives and new construction
from future flooding. Section 1315 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4022, prohibits
flood insurance coverage as authorized under the National Flood Insurance Program, 42 U.S.C. 4001 et seq., unless
an appropriate public body adopts adequate floodplain management measures with effective enforcement measures.
The communities listed in this document no longer meet that statutory requirement for compliance with program regulations,
44 CFR part 59 et seq. Accordingly, the communities will be suspended on the effective date in the third column. As of
that date, flood insurance will no longer be available in the community. However, some of these communities may adopt
and submit the required documentation of legally enforceable floodplain management measures after this rule is
published but prior to the actual suspension date. These communities will not be suspended and will continue their
eligibility for the sale of insurance. A notice withdrawing the suspension of the communities will be published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has identified the special flood hazard areas in these communities
by publishing a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). The date of the FIRM if one has been published, is indicated in the fourth
column of the table. No direct Federal financial assistance (except assistance pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford
Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act not in connection with a flood) may legally be provided for construction
or acquisition of buildings in the identified special flood hazard area of communities not participating in the NFIP
and identified for more than a year, on the Federal Emergency Management Agency's initial flood insurance map of the
community as having flood-prone areas (section 202(a) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4106(a),
as amended). This prohibition against certain types of Federal assistance becomes effective for the communities
listed on the date shown in the last column.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Deputy Associate Director finds that notice and public comment under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and unnecessary
because communities listed in this final rule have been adequately notified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each community receives a 6-month, 90-day, and 30-day notification addressed to the Chief Executive Officer that
the community will be suspended unless the required floodplain management measures are met prior to the effective
suspension date. Since these notifications have been made, this final rule may take effect within less than 30 days.

The Deputy Associate Director has determined that this rule is exempt from the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility

unless an appropriate public body adopts adequate floodplain management measures with effective enforcement measures.
The communities listed no longer comply with the statutory requirements, and after the effective date, flood insurance
will no longer be available in the communities unless they take remedial action.

The Federal Maritime Commission is amending part 501 of title 46 of the Code of Federal Regulations to reflect the transfer
of OIRM from BOA to the Office of the Managing Director. Notice and public procedure are not necessary prior to the issuance
of this rule because it deals solely with matters of agency organization. Neither is a delayed effective date required.
This action does not affect the substantive duties and functions of OIRM.

I. Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. This Memorandum Opinion and Order addresses issues raised in petitions for reconsideration of our Report and Order
adopted March 11, 1993, 58 FR 17350 (4/2/93) which established rules to implement the mandatory television broadcast
signal carriage (``must-carry'') and retransmission consent provisions of the Cable Television Consumer Protection
and Competition Act of 1992 (``1992 Cable Act''). In a Clarification Order adopted on May 28, 1993, 58 FR 32449 (6/10/93),
we addressed specific concerns raised in these petitions relating to signal quality, copyright indemnification
and translator ownership. In an Order adopted on July 15, 1993, 58 FR 40366 (7/28/93), we addressed additional concerns
relating to carriage rights, to the failure of broadcast stations to elect either must-carry or retransmission consent
status, and to the channel position for such stations. On October 5, 1993, we adopted a Stay Order, 58 FR 53429 (10/15/93),
which stayed two provisions of the retransmission consent rules, with respect to VHF/UHF antenna ownership and carriage
in the entirety of broadcast signals, pending our resolution of those issues in this proceeding. In this Memorandum
Opinion and Order we will address all remaining issues raised in the petitions for reconsideration, as well as the
outstanding issues from the Stay Order. We will also take this opportunity, on our own motion, to clarify certain other
issues raised in the Report and Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. We note that the constitutionality of the must-carry provisions of the 1992 Cable Act were challenged before the
Supreme Court. In 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 v. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FCC,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a special three-judge panel of the District Court found the must-carry provisions constitutional. On appeal, the
Supreme Court vacated the decision and remanded the case back to the three-judge panel for further proceedings. While
the case is pending, the must-carry provisions of the 1992 Cable Act remain in effect, as do the Commission's must-carry
rules.

1. Definition of a Qualified Noncommercial Station.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Section 615(l)(1) provides that a local noncommercial educational television (``NCE'') station qualifies for
must-carry rights if it is licensed by the Commission as an NCE station and if it is owned and operated by a public agency,
nonprofit foundation, or corporation or association that is eligible to receive a community service grant from the
Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 An NCE station is also considered qualified if it is owned and operated by a municipality and transmits predominantly
noncommercial programs for educational purposes.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 For purposes of must-carry rights, an NCE station is considered local if its community of license is within 50 miles
of, or its signal places a Grade B contour over, the principal headend of the cable system. This definition includes
the translator of any NCE station with five watts or higher power serving the franchise area, a full-service station
or translator licensed to a channel reserved for noncommercial educational use, and such stations and translators
operating on channels not so reserved as the Commission determines are qualified NCE stations.

4. The staff has received informal inquiries requesting clarification as to when a translator is ``serving the franchise
area'' of the cable system. Because the service area of a translator differs from that of a full power broadcast station,
we believe that guidance should be provided to assist interested parties in determining whether a translator serves
the franchise area of the cable system. We believe it appropriate to adopt a standard based on coverage and contour,
which has been used in the past and which should be easily identifiable. Therefore, for purposes of a translator serving
the cable system's franchise area, the coverage area of such translator shall be its predicted protected contour
as specified in &sect;74.707 of our rules.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Signal Carriage Obligations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. In the Report and Order, we indicated that Section 615(b) requires cable systems to carry any qualified local NCE
television station requesting carriage. Systems with 12 or fewer activated channels must carry the signal of one
qualified local NCE station. Systems with 13 to 36 activated channels must carry at least one qualified local NCE station,
but need not carry more than three such stations. Cable systems with more than 36 activated channels are generally
required to carry all NCE stations requesting carriage. If a system with fewer than 36 activated channels operates
beyond the presence of a qualified local NCE station, it is required to import and carry a qualified NCE station. In
addition, cable systems must continue to provide carriage to all qualified local NCE television stations whose signals
were carried on their systems as of March 29, 1990, regardless of the proximity of those stations to the system's principal
headend.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
6. First, on our own motion, we clarify the carriage requirements of a system with more than 36 activated channels.
The 1992 Cable Act states that systems with more than 36 channels must carry the signal of all NCE stations requesting
carriage, with one exception: systems with more than 36 channels are not required to carry an additional local NCE
station if the programming of such station substantially duplicates the programming of a qualified local NCE station
already being carried. It has come to our attention that &sect;76.56(a)(1)(iii) of the Commission's rules as adopted
in the Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 has been interpreted by some cable operators to require that only three stations need be carried. However, with respect
to systems with more than 36 channels, we clarify that the reference to the number three is a minimum, not a maximum number.
A system with more than 36 channels must carry all NCE stations requesting carriage, but is not required to carry more
than three NCE stations if the additional station substantially duplicates the signal of NCE stations already carried
by the system. Section 76.56(a)(1)(iii) is being revised accordingly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Second, we emphasize that the requirement in Section 615(c) to continue carriage of stations carried as of March
29, 1990 applies only to qualified local NCE television stations and does not apply to a non-local NCE television station
which was being imported as of that date. A cable system which was carrying a non-local NCE station in excess of its mandatory
carriage requirements is permitted to drop that station, subject to giving appropriate notice. However, if a cable
system which would be required to import a NCE signal pursuant to Section 615 (b)(3)(B) or (b)(2)(B) was importing
a non-local qualified NCE station on March 29, 1990, the system is required to continue carriage of such station. Prior
carriage of the non-local NCE station generally indicates that a good quality signal is received at the cable system's
headend. In addition, where the cable system voluntarily had been importing such signal prior to March 29, 1990, the
continued carriage of such station will not result in additional copyright liability for the cable system. In the
event a local NCE station subsequently becomes qualified, the cable operator may drop the distant signal (subject
to notification requirements) and substitute the qualified local NCE station. Section 76.56(a)(5) is being revised
accordingly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Although the Act generally does not require copyright liability to be paid by a cable operator for the carriage of
local NCE station signal added after March 29, 1990, in the case of importation, the non-local NCE station has neither
must-carry nor retransmission rights. We do not believe it appropriate for a non-local NCE station which is being
imported to be required to reimburse the cable operator for copyright costs. The 1992 Cable Act specifically provides
that a cable system can recover such costs as part of the basic service tier rate, and we believe that this is the appropriate
manner for dealing with such costs.

1. General Signal Carriage Requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Small System Exception.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 614(a) requires carriage of local commercial television stations and qualified low power television stations.
Section 614(b) establishes the number of signals which must be carried by cable systems based on their channel capacity.
In particular, it provides that a cable system with 12 or fewer usable activated channels must carry the signals of
at least three local commercial television stations. Such a system is exempt from any requirements of Section 614,
however, if it serves 300 or fewer subscribers, as long as it does not delete from carriage the signal of any broadcast
television station. In the Report and Order, the Commission concluded that, under this exception, a system must not
delete any station it carried on October 5, 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Although the language of the text accurately reflects this intention, the Community Antenna Television Association
(``CATA'') points out that the related rule is misleading because it implies that the system must have 300 or fewer
subscribers as of October 5, 1992. We are revising &sect;76.56(b)(1) of our rules to reflect that, at any time that
a cable system with 12 or fewer activated channels serves 300 or fewer subscribers, it is exempt from the mandatory
carriage requirements under Section 614, as long as it does not delete any signal of a broadcast television station
which was carried on that system on October 5, 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Definition of Local Commercial Television Station.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 614(h)(1)(A) defines a local commercial television station for the purpose of the must-carry rules as ``any
full power television broadcast station, other than a qualified noncommercial television station within the meaning
of Section 615(l)(1), licensed and operating on a channel regularly assigned to its community by the Commission that,
with respect to a particular cable system, is within the same television market as the cable system.'' In the Report
and Order, we inadvertently defined local commercial television station as ``any full power 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
commercial
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 television station *&blank;*&blank;*'', which had the unintended effect of excluding non-qualified noncommercial
stations from the definition. A non-qualified NCE station is any NCE station which does not meet the qualification
criteria established in Section 615(g). Such a station is not entitled to must-carry rights under that section. We
believe that the definition of local commercial television station contained in the 1992 Cable Act clearly includes
non-qualified NCE stations; the definition includes all stations other than ``qualified NCE stations.'' Consistent
with the language of the 1992 Cable Act, we determine that NCE stations which are not ``qualified'' NCE stations for
must-carry purposes may assert must-carry rights under Section 614 within their local market, just like any other
broadcast station.

Availability and Identification of Must-Carry Signals.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 614(b)(7) provides that all must-carry signals shall be provided to every subscriber of a cable system and
shall be viewable via cable on all television receivers of a subscriber which are connected to a cable system by a cable
operator or for which the cable operator provides a connection. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we declined to grant a request to provide a special exception for commercial subscribers (e.g., hotels, hospitals)
that receive specially designed channel line-ups. We stated our belief that the 1992 Cable Act is clear in its application
of Section 614(b)(7) to every subscriber of a cable system, that it grants no authority to exempt a specific class of
cable subscribers from the carriage requirements, and that there is no reason to believe that such commercial subscribers
are not interested in receiving local broadcast signals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. On reconsideration, we note that the must-carry provisions do not distinguish between commercial and residential
viewers. Congress made clear its intent that all subscribers have access to local commercial broadcast signals.
We do not believe that petitioners have presented sufficient cause to change our earlier interpretation of the 1992
Cable Act. Therefore, we affirm that all subscribers must have access to these signals on all television sets connected
by the cable operator or for which the cable operator provides a connection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. It is our understanding that the on-channel carriage of some UHF signals has resulted in situations where a converter
box supplied by a cable operator does not contain the necessary channel capacity to permit a subscriber to access a
UHF must-carry signal through the converter. For example, a converter may supply channels 2&hyph;36 while the must-carry
station is on channel 55. Where a cable operator chooses to provide subscribers with signals of must-carry stations
through the use of converter boxes supplied by the cable operator, the converter boxes must be capable of passing through
all of the signals entitled to carriage on the basic service tier of the cable system, not just some of them. In addition,
any converter boxes provided for this purpose must be provided at rates in accordance with Section 623(b)(3). Therefore,
in a situation where the subscriber's converter is supplied by the cable operator, and is incapable of receiving all
signals as required by Section 614(b)(7), the cable operator must make provision for a converter which is capable
of providing these signals.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 If it is necessary to replace the converter, the subscriber must not be required to pay additional sums nor to pay for
the installation.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 As discussed below, we have provided a mechanism for relief for cable systems which cannot meet the on-channel requests
of must-carry stations. A decision not to seek such relief may not be used to contravene the directives of the 1992 Cable
Act.

(released November 10, 1993), in which the Mass Media Bureau noted that converter boxes provided by the cable system
must be capable of transmitting all the signals entitled to mandatory carriage on the basic tier, and required Cablevision,
because it was in the midst of an upgrade of its system, to switch station WLIG to a channel receivable by all subscribers,
without the necessity of an additional converter box, during the rebuilding of its system.

We note that where the cable operator authorizes subscribers to install additional receiver connections, but does
not provide the subscriber with such connections, or with the equipment and materials for such connections, the operator
must notify such subscribers of all broadcast stations carried on the cable system which cannot be viewed via cable
without a converter box and the operator must offer to sell or lease such a converter box to such subscribers at rates
in accordance with section 623(b)(3).

2. Definition of a Television Market.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. Use of ADI Markets and the Home County Exception.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under the 1992 Cable Act, a local commercial television station is entitled to must-carry status on all cable systems
located in the same television market as the cable system. The 1992 Cable Act states that the television market shall
be determined pursuant to &sect;73.3555(d)(3)(i) of our rules, which in turn defines a television market in terms
of the Area of Dominant Influence (``ADI''), as defined by Arbitron.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 In the Report and Order, the Commission noted that each county in the contiguous United States is assigned by Arbitron
exclusively to one ADI, and that each broadcast station licensed to a community located in an ADI is considered local
throughout that ADI. The Commission established one exception to that rule, determining that each broadcast station
will also be considered a must-carry station in its home county, even if that station is assigned to a different ADI
from that of its home county (the ``home county exception'').

We note that Arbitron has cancelled its television ratings service. However, the decision will not have an impact
on the use of Arbitron-designated ADIs until the next must-carry/retransmission consent election which must take
place by October 1, 1996. We will address this issue sufficiently before that date.

The Administrative Procedure Act (``APA'') 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
requires an agency, when issuing a general notice of proposed rule making, to provide the public with ``either the
terms or the substance of a proposed rule or a description of the subject and issues involved.'' The APA, however, ``does
not require an agency to publish in advance every precise proposal which it may ultimately adopt as a rule.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. The Notice, 57 FR 56298 (11/27/92), set forth the 1992 Cable Act's direction that such markets would be determined
primarily in the manner provided in &sect;73.3555(d)(3)(i) of the Commission's rules, (which section uses Arbitron-defined
ADIs), and specifically sought comment from the public concerning the Congressionally recognized need for adjustments
to or modifications of television markets.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission specifically stated that ``it may determine that particular communities are part of more than one
television market,'' and further explained that it would act upon written requests to add or delete communities to
a station's market ``to better reflect market realities and effectuate the purposes of this Act.'' We believe that
it was apparent that the Commission was likely to receive comments and suggestions regarding methods to assure that
television stations' must-carry markets, both generally and in individual cases, best reflect market realities
and the objective of localism underlying broadcast signal carriage obligations. While the Notice did not specifically
seek comment on the home county exception, we believe that the home county exception is a ``logical outgrowth'' of
the Notice.

18. The home county exception does not violate either the spirit or letter of the 1992 Cable Act. Specifically, we disagree
with the proposition that although a television station's must-carry rights are defined primarily by Arbitron ADIs,
there can be no must-carry rights beyond the ADI to which a station is assigned by Arbitron. Section 614(h)(1)(C)(i)
recognizes a potential, but easily corrected, deficiency in the use of Arbitron ADIs to define a station's must-carry
market. We find no basis to presume that the Commission may not adjust ADIs generally to ensure that stations have must-carry
rights in those areas where their service is appropriately ``local.'' We agree with Granite that adoption of the home
county exception is separate and apart from the procedure established to make individual station market adjustments
based on particular situations.

Modification of ADI Markets.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As noted in the Report and Order, the 1992 Cable Act permits the Commission to add or subtract communities from a television
station's market to better reflect marketplace conditions or to promote the goal of localism underlying the signal
carriage provisions. In its petition, INTV requests that the Commission add or subtract a community for all stations
in the market, not for an individual station. INTV suggests that upon the addition of a community to a market, every
station in the community would attain must-carry rights in that market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20. The Commission has already addressed this subject in the Report and Order in response to parties' contentions
that ADI modification should be made on a community, rather than on a station, basis. Both the 1992 Cable Act and our
rules require, for each broadcast station, an evidentiary showing from an interested party, with opportunity for
comment. INTV's request would not meet this requirement and therefore must be rejected. We reiterate our statement
in the Report and Order that we will accept joint filings by a group of stations or a single request from a cable operator
for changes for more than one station licensed to the same community, so long as the submitted information demonstrates
that each station is entitled to have its market modified. The relief procedures will ensure that the 1992 Cable Act's
objectives of promoting localism and reflecting market realities are achieved.

21. As noted above, Section 614(h)(1)(C) directs the Commission, when considering ADI modification requests, to
promote localism by taking into account the four factors listed in that section. Press Broadcasting Company, Inc.
(``Press''), the licensee of WKCF (TV), Clermont, Florida, seeks clarification or partial reconsideration of the
types of evidence the Commission has indicated that it will consider in assessing proposed changes in a station's
must-carry market.

Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 are merely examples of the types of evidence that might be considered in a request to modify an ADI. The Commission purposely
did not restrict the types of evidence that may be used to demonstrate that a station's must-carry market should be
modified. The Commission declined to prejudge the importance of any of the factors set forth in the statute, noting
that each case will be unique. Accordingly, we note that the factors suggested by Press may be employed by parties to
show the appropriateness of altering a station's must-carry market, although the importance of such factors may
differ from one situation to the next.

Section 76.51 Top 100 Market List.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 614(f) of the 1992 Cable Act directs the Commission to issue regulations that include revisions needed to
update the list of top 100 television markets and their designated communities contained in &sect;76.51. Although
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 sought guidance on how to fulfill this requirement, the comments were general in nature and did not offer a mechanism
for revising the top 100 market list, including criteria for determining when a city of license should become a designated
community in a television market. Accordingly, the Commission concluded in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that a wholesale revision of &sect;76.51 was unnecessary and stated that it would only update the existing list by
adding those designated communities requested by parties providing specific evidence that a particular market
change is warranted. The Commission made three specific market modifications, and stated that further revisions
to this list would be made on a case-by-case basis. The Commission stated that requests for modification should demonstrate
``commonality'' between the proposed community to be added to a market designation and the market as a whole, and that
such requests would be made in accordance with the factors in Section 614(h)(1)(C) and the related rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

24. A number of broadcast television licensees in Columbus, Ohio filed petitions for reconsideration respecting
the addition of Chillicothe to the Columbus, Ohio television market. These petitioners allege that the Commission's
action was taken without sufficient notice to interested parties and was therefore based on an inadequate factual
record.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
25. As noted above, the APA requires an agency, when issuing a general notice of proposed rule making, to provide the
public with ``either the terms or the substance of a proposed rule or a description of the subject and issues involved,''
but ``does not require an agency to publish in advance every precise proposal which it may ultimately adopt as a rule.''
In the Notice, the Commission specifically requested that interested parties ``comment on what modifications to
the television markets specified in &sect;76.51 of our rules is needed to ensure that it reflects current market realities.''
In so doing, the Commission observed that this proceeding necessarily overlaps with an ongoing proceeding involving,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the makeup of the &sect;76.51 market list in relation to the Commission's program exclusivity rules.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 Therefore, the Commission explicitly stated that Docket 87&hyph;24 would be reopened for further comment in the
context of this rulemaking in order to facilitate coordination of the overlapping aspects of the two proceedings.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 in this proceeding, the proponents of three previously-filed market change petitions for rulemaking filed comments
which incorporated by reference their rulemaking petitions and urged the adoption of their &sect;76.51 market amendment
proposals. One of these proponents, Star Cable Associates (``Star''), operator of a cable television system serving
the community of Brazoria, Texas, and portions of Brazoria County, Texas, filed a petition for reconsideration based
on the concept that although the Commission granted other requests to modify existing television markets, the Commission
did not act on Star's request to amend &sect;76.51 to add the community of Alvin to the Houston, Texas market. Star states
that it has had such a request pending before the Commission since January 1991. Star's comments to the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 and included numerous other cable operators. These parties were arguing that the Commission need not revise the &sect;76.51
market list, stating that ``[n]o revision to this list is needed to implement the must-carry rules since the current
ADI markets are to be used for determining must-carry rights.'' It was suggested in those comments that the Commission
``might wish to update the list *&blank;*&blank;* to add new communities to existing markets for stations which have
gone on the air since the list was last revised'' and, in that context noted the copyright consequences explained in
the pending petition regarding the Houston market. However, neither Adelphia nor Star specifically requested action
in the must-carry context on Star's pending petition for rulemaking. Under these circumstances, we do not believe
that it was erroneous to defer action on the Star petition.

26. In light of the nature of this proceeding, the statutory instruction to amend, as necessary, &sect;76.51, and
the incorporation by reference of the issues in Docket 87&hyph;24, we conclude that the Notice amply alerted the public
that potential amendments to that rule section could be made in the context of this specific proceeding.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission explicitly sought public comment on what modifications to &sect;76.51 would be necessary to fulfill
the directive of Section 614(f), and we believe that specific market change proposals are a natural and logical outgrowth
of the range of issues presented in the Notice and discussed in the comments filed in this proceeding. Accordingly,
we are not persuaded by the petitioners that the Notice did not provide adequate notice to interested parties that
specific amendments to &sect;76.51 were likely to be considered in this proceeding.

Neither the APA nor the Commission's rules specifically required that the petitioners receive personal service
of the particular market change proposals tendered in comments filed in this proceeding. Moreover, we observe that
at least one petitioner, Outlet, notes that the filing of Triplett's submission was referenced in a public notice
of comments received in this docket. However, we do not agree that the Commission was somehow obligated to indicate
the nature of Triplett's comments, and the petitioners offer no support for that particular proposition. To the extent
that Triplett incorporated by reference its previous request regarding Chillicothe, which was also noted in Docket
87&hyph;24, we do not believe that obviated the responsibility of interested parties to assess the nature of comments
received in response to the general rulemaking issues specifically raised in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

We do not agree that the action taken with respect to a proposal to include Athens in the Atlanta market indicates that
the Commission could only act in independent and separate rulemaking proceedings. The Georgia Public Television
Commission (``GPTC''), licensee of noncommercial educational television station WGTV(TV), Athens, Georgia,
sought to include Athens as a designated community in the Atlanta market essentially to increase the station's visibility
and fund raising in the market. GPTC's proposal was not submitted in the instant proceeding directly or incorporated
by reference, but rather in comments supporting the requested action in MM Docket 92&hyph;295, which specifically
addressed the Rome proposal. Parties commenting on MM Docket 92&hyph;295 had no opportunity to comment upon the Athens
proposal in the context of that proceeding. Moreover, GPTC's proposal differs significantly from the competition
and carriage issues vis-&aacute;-vis commercial stations raised in either the instant proceeding or in MM Docket
92&hyph;295 (relating specifically to Rome). In light of the action taken in the

Section 614(b)(5) provides that a cable operator is not required to carry the signal of any local commercial television
station that substantially duplicates the signal of another local commercial television station which is carried
on its cable system, or to carry the signals of more than one local commercial television station affiliated with a
particular broadcast network.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 In the Report and Order, based on the legislative history of this section of the 1992 Cable Act, we decided that two stations
``substantially duplicate'' each other ``if they simultaneously broadcast identical programming for more than
50 percent of the broadcast week.'' For purposes of this definition, identical programming means the identical episode
of the same program series.

29. We continue to believe that our definition of substantial duplication is appropriate for determining signal
carriage obligations. We note that it is consistent with the legislative history that indicates that this term refers
to the ``simultaneous transmission of identical programming on two stations'' and which ``constitutes a majority
of the programming on each station.'' While we agree with NCTA that Congress gave the Commission discretion to define
substantial duplication, we continue to believe that the most appropriate approach here is to act consistently with
the legislative history. Congress did not intend for a single duplicative program, whether subject to blackout or
not, to be the determining factor. Finally, we observe that our rules often use different definitions for similar
terms based on the purpose of the policy involved. The Commission's exclusivity rules are intended to protect the
rights that a broadcaster has bargained for with the supplier of a particular program. The must-carry rules, however,
are intended to ensure that local stations are available to cable subscribers. Thus, we reject the proposed modification
to our definition of substantial duplication.

30. Qualified Low Power Television Station.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 614(h)(2) contains the statutory requirements a low power television station (LPTV) must meet before it
will be considered ``qualified'' for must-carry purposes. Section 614(h)(2) provides that an LPTV station must
broadcast for at least the minimum number of hours the Commission requires of commercial broadcast stations. The
station must adhere to certain Commission requirements regarding non-entertainment programming and employment.
The station must address local news and informational needs that full power stations are not adequately serving because
the full power stations are distant from the LPTV station's community of license. The station must comply with the
Commission's LPTV interference regulations. The station must be within 35 miles of the cable headend and deliver
a good quality over-the-air signal to the headend. The station's community of license and the cable system's franchise
area both must have been located outside of the largest 160 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA's) on June 30, 1990,
and the population of the LPTV station's community of license must not have exceeded 35,000 on that date. Lastly, there
cannot be any full power television station licensed to any community within the county or other political subdivision
served by the cable system. As we stated in the Report and Order, a low power television station must meet all of the statutory
requirements to be ``qualified'' for must-carry status. Cable systems are required to carry a qualified LPTV station
only if there are not sufficient full power local commercial television stations to fulfill the cable operator's
must-carry obligations under Section 614(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
31. Moran Communications (``Moran'') and the Community Broadcaster Association (``CBA'') request a revision to
the requirement in Section 614(h)(2)(F) that, in order for an LPTV station to be qualified, there cannot be any full
power station licensed to any community within the county or political subdivision served by the cable system. Under
this exception, Moran and CBA explain, an LPTV station would qualify for must-carry rights if it meets all the requirements
of subsections 614(h)(2), except for subsection F, and if none of the full power stations in the county or political
subdivision served by the cable system offers local news or informational programming. They contend that when a satellite
station is repeating another station's signal and not broadcasting any local news or informational programming
to meet the needs of the local community, the satellite station should not be considered a full power station for the
purposes of Section 614(h)(2)(F). CBA also argues that a satellite station is a ``passive repeater,'' and because
Section 614(h)(1)(b)(1) specifically excludes passive repeaters from the definition of a local commercial television
station, it follows that Congress intentionally gave less to repeaters than to originating stations in terms of must-carry
rights. Therefore, argues CBA, ``[t]he Congressional recognition of the lesser value of the repeaters must be incorporated
into the must-carry rule *&blank;*&blank;*.'' In opposition, NCTA argues that the Commission cannot rewrite the
statute, which defines qualified LPTV stations and governs the must-carry rights of LPTV stations.

32. We agree with NCTA that the provisions of the 1992 Cable Act may not be amended by the Commission through the rule
making process. Further, contrary to CBA's interpretation of Section 614(h), satellite stations meet the definition
of a local commercial television station, are full power stations pursuant to Section 614(h)(2)(F), and are generally
not simply passive repeaters. We disagree with CBA's contention that Congress intended satellite stations to be
treated differently from other full power stations when reviewing the statutory requirements an LPTV station must
meet to gain must-carry status. Moran and CBA request that we codify the exception in footnote 217 to the qualification
requirements of an LPTV station. While the Report and Order had suggested the possibility of additional circumstances
in which LPTV carriage might be warranted, it now appears that this is an area where the specific statutory provisions
and the balancing incorporated therein must necessarily guide our enforcement of the mandatory carriage provisions
for LPTV stations.

33. Section 614(b)(3)(A) and Section 615(g)(1) require cable operators to carry the primary video, accompanying
audio, and line 21 closed caption transmission, in its entirety, of both qualified local commercial and NCE stations
when fulfilling their must-carry obligations. With respect to qualified local commercial stations, cable operators
also are required, to the extent technically feasible, to retransmit program-related material carried in the vertical
blanking interval (VBI) or on subcarriers. Retransmission of other material in the VBI or other non-program-related
material (including teletext and other subscription and advertiser-supported information services) is at the
discretion of the operator. With respect to local qualified NCE stations, cable operators are required to transmit,
to the extent technically feasible, program-related material carried in the VBI, or on subcarriers, that may be necessary
for receipt of programming by handicapped persons or for educational or language purposes. Retransmission of other
material in the VBI or on subcarriers is at the discretion of the operator. Cable operators may, where technically
feasible and appropriate, remove ghost-cancelling information carried in a station's VBI if the cable operator
applies an adequate alternative methodology at the headend.

 provide useful guidance for what constitutes program-related material.
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 We declined to further define ``program-related,'' noting that carriage of information in the VBI is rapidly evolving.
As a result of our reliance on the approach followed in WGN for guidance, we rejected a proposal by A.C. Nielsen Company
(``Nielsen'') to require program identification codes to be carried by a cable system.

35. The WGN case addressed the extent to which the copyright on a television program also included program material
in the VBI of the signal. The WGN court set out three factors for making a copyright determination. First, the broadcaster
must intend for the information in the VBI to be seen by the same viewers who are watching the video signal. Second, the
VBI information must be available during the same interval of time as the video signal. Third, the VBI information
must be an integral part of the program. The court accepted WGN's future programming schedules as an ``integral part
of the program.'' The court in WGN held that if the information in the VBI is intended to be seen by the viewers who are
watching the video signal, during the same interval of time as the video signal, and as an integral part of the program
on the video signal, then the VBI and the video signal are one copyrighted expression and must both be carried if one
is to be carried. While the court did not define an ``integral part of the program,'' the WGN VBI information not only
included local news, but also contained future programming schedules for WGN, and the court upheld the VBI as one copyrightable
expression with the video signal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
36. We continue to believe that the factors articulated in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
WGN
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 provide the best guidance for determining whether material in the VBI is program-related and, therefore, must be
carried by the cable system. Accordingly, material that is intended to be seen by the viewers of the main program, during
the same time interval as the main program, and which is an integral part of the main program will be entitled to carriage
along with the main signal of the must-carry station. However, on reconsideration, we clarify that the factors set
forth in WGN do not necessarily form the exclusive basis for determining program-relatedness. We believe there will
be instances where material which does not fit squarely within the factors listed in WGN will be program-related under
the statute. For example, on reconsideration, although SID codes may not precisely meet each factor in WGN, we find
that they are program-related under the statute because they constitute information intrinsically related to the
particular program received by the viewer. Further, SID codes provide important information that is useful to both
broadcasters and cable operators. We note that the 1992 Cable Act recognized the importance of the national ratings
period and prohibited cable operators from repositioning or deleting stations during that time. This interpretation
is consistent with previous Commission decisions in which SID codes were found to be program-related in other contexts.
Finally, we reiterate that, in order to be program-related, it is not necessary that the copyright holder in the main
program and in the material in the VBI be the same.

2. Channel Positioning.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
37. The 1992 Cable Act provides both commercial and NCE television stations which elect must-carry status the additional
right to select the channel position on which they will be carried by the cable system, within certain specified options.
Section 614(b)(6) provides that the signals of a local commercial television station carried pursuant to the must-carry
rules must be carried on either (1) the same channel on which the station is broadcast over-the-air, (2) the cable channel
on which it was carried on July 19, 1985, or (3) the cable channel on which it was carried on January 1, 1992. The election,
in the absence of conflicts, is left up to the station involved. See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 47 U.S.C. 534(b)(6). Similarly, Section 615(g)(5) requires that NCE signals carried pursuant to must-carry requirements
must appear on the cable system channel number on which the qualified local NCE station is broadcast over-the-air,
or on the channel on which it was carried on July 19, 1985, at the election of the station. In either case, another channel
number that is mutually agreed upon by the station and the cable operator may be selected. Alternatively, the broadcast
station and cable operator may agree on a mutually acceptable alternative channel position. We note that, with respect
to channel position, a qualified LPTV station enjoys the channel positioning rights of a commercial television station.
Section 76.57 is being revised accordingly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
38. Based on comments received in response to the Notice, we declined in the Report and Order to adopt a formal priority
structure for resolving conflicting channel positioning claims. We stated that we expected compliance with the
channel positioning requests of broadcasters ``absent a compelling technical reason for not being able to accommodate
such requests,'' and that ``inconvenience, marketing problems, the need to reconfigure the basic tier or the need
to employ additional traps or make technical changes'' would not be sufficient reasons to deny a channel positioning
request. In addition, we determined that ``only where placement of a signal on a chosen channel results in interference
or degraded signal quality to the must-carry station or an adjacent channel, or causes a substantial technical or
signal security problem, will we permit cable operators to carry a broadcast signal on a channel not chosen by the station.''
We noted that most systems would be able to configure their service to meet this statutory requirement and that a cable
system claiming that it cannot meet a channel positioning request for technical reasons will have to provide evidence
that clearly demonstrates that inability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
39. In the Order adopted July 15, 1993, we addressed certain issues relating to continued carriage of retransmission
consent stations and the channel position for ``default'' must-carry stations. In that Order, we stated that cable
systems which are required to carry the signal of a default station ``shall place that signal on one of the statutorily
defined positions, at the system's discretion.'' Although the footnote to that sentence correctly stated that the
station licensee makes the election, the text incorrectly stated ``at the system's discretion.'' We clarify that,
as required by the 1992 Cable Act, the choice of statutorily defined channel position is made by the station, not the
cable system. The Order also determined that, in the event of a conflict, the station making an affirmative election
has priority over the default station. Finally, we stated that, where the station making an affirmative election
has selected the only statutory channel position available to the default station, the cable system may place the
default station on a channel of the cable system's choice, so long as that channel is included on the basic tier. Section
76.57 of our rules was amended to reflect the channel positioning options discussed and adopted in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Order.

40. The 1992 Cable Act provides that the channel position of a station which has elected must-carry rights is a decision
to be made by the broadcaster from among the listed statutory alternatives. The Act does not distinguish between VHF
and UHF stations. We emphasize that our statements in the Report and Order regarding channel positioning apply to
UHF, in addition to VHF, stations. As noted there, cable operators must comply with the channel positioning requirements
absent a compelling technical reason.
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 Further, in response to a broadcaster's complaint regarding denial of a channel positioning request, a cable system
will be required to provide evidence to the Commission clearly demonstrating that the operator cannot meet the request
for technical reasons. As part of such a showing, a cable operator may present evidence as to the costs involved in remedying
the technical problem.

As noted above, inconvenience, marketing problems, the need to reconfigure the basic tier or to employ additional

the must-carry station or an adjacent channel, or causes a substantial technical or signal security problem will
we permit cable operators to carry a broadcast station on a channel not chosen by the station.

3. Signal Quality
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
41. In the Report and Order and the Clarification Order we addressed issues relating to the signal quality of a broadcast
station asserting must-carry rights. We noted that Section 614(h) established specific minimum signal levels for
a good quality signal of a commercial television station (i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
^45 dBm for UHF signals and ^49 dBm for VHF signals). Neither the 1992 Cable Act nor the Commission's Orders specifically
stated what would be considered a ``good quality signal'' for must-carry purposes with respect to noncommercial
stations, educational translator stations, and low power television stations, but Section 615(g)(4) states that
the Commission may define a ``signal of good quality'' for noncommercial stations. We do so now, on our own motion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
42. We note that in a Memorandum Opinion and Order (Independence Public Media of Philadelphia, Inc. against Suburban
Cable TV Co., Inc.) CSR&hyph;3806&hyph;M), 8 FCC Rcd 6319 (1993), the Mass Media Bureau decided to utilize the standards
for commercial television stations as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
prima facie 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
tests to initially determine, absent other evidence, whether noncommercial stations place adquate signal levels
over a cable system's principal headend. The Mass Media Bureau has relied on this test in processing must-carry complaint
cases and we believe that is appropriate. With respect to low power and NCE translator stations, we are adopting the
same signal quality standard of ^49 dBm for VHF and ^45 dBm for UHF signals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
43. With respect to the manner of testing for a good quality signal, we find that the Mass Media Bureau has adopted an
appropriate method for measuring signal strength in the Memorandum Opinion and Order. Generally, if a test measuring
signal strength results in an initial reading of less than ^51 dBm for a UHF station, at least four readings must be taken
over a two-hour period. If the initial readings are between ^51 dBm and ^45 dBm, inclusive, readings must be taken over
a 24-hour period with measurements not more than four hours apart to establish reliable test results. For a VHF station,
if the initial readings are less than ^55 dBm, we believe that at least four readings must be taken over a two-hour period.
Where the initial readings are between ^55 dBm and ^49 dBm, inclusive, readings should be taken over a 24-hour period,
with measurements no more than four hours apart to establish reliable test results.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
44. Cable operators are further expected to employ sound engineering measurement practices. Therefore, signal
strength surveys should, at a minimum, include the following: (1) Specific make and model numbers of the equipment
used, as well as its age and most recent date(s) of calibration; (2) description(s) of the characteristics of the equipment
used, such as antenna ranges and radiation patterns; (3) height of the antenna above ground level and whether the antenna
was properly oriented; and (4) weather conditions and time of day when the tests were done. We believe that adherence
to these procedures and requirements will result in fewer disputes over the signal quality of broadcasting stations.

<FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>
 Under the 1992 Cable Act, a cable operator is generally not required to carry a station that would otherwise qualify
for must-carry status if the station would be considered distant for copyright purposes, unless the station indemnifies
the cable operator for its copyright liability.
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission required cable operators to notify local commercial and noncommercial stations by May 3, 1993 that
they may not be entitled to must-carry status because their carriage may cause an increased copyright liability.
In the Report and Order, the Commission stated that it expected cable operators and broadcasters to cooperate with
each other to ensure that operators are compensated for the cost of carriage of ``distant'' must-carry signals and
that broadcast licensees pay only their fair share.
<FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission stated that each licensee should be responsible for the increased copyright costs specifically associated
with carriage of its station as a must-carry signal and that stations should be counted in the order they satisfy all
the necessary conditions for attaining must-carry status. The Commission also determined that it would be reasonable
for a cable operator to receive a written commitment for such payments from a broadcaster in return for an estimate
of the broadcaster's expected copyright liability, based on previous payments and financial information.

We clarify that, in situations where copyright liability is incurred for carriage in some of the communities served

any community served by the system, unless the operator is able to provide different channel line-ups to the different
communities.

46. On May 28, 1993, the Commission adopted a Clarification Order (``Clarification'') that, among other things,
addressed certain copyright issues. We stated that we would require a cable operator to provide a broadcast station
with a good faith estimate of the potential copyright liability for carriage of the station during the next copyright
accounting period, as well as a copy of the most recent form filed with the Copyright Office for existing distant signal
carriage that details the payments made for carriage of distant signals. The cable operator, however, is not required
to make legal judgments pertaining to the amount of indemnity involved. In addition, a cable operator is required
to provide such information within three business days of receipt of a written request from a broadcaster.
<FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>
 Any cable operator not providing sufficient information to a broadcast station regarding potential copyright liability
in the required timely fashion may be subject to Commission sanctions.

In its opposition, Time Warner argues that cable operators should be given at least seven days, not three, to respond
to any requests for information regarding copyright liability. We reject Time Warner's proposal and note that in
the Clarification we observed that the information that must be provided to broadcasters should be readily available
to the cable operator.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
47. We concur with INTV and NAB that stations should be able to commit to copyright indemnification for periods shorter
than the three years specified in the 1992 Cable Act. In light of the numerous factors that affect the liability payments,
we believe that commitments can be for periods as short as one year (two six-month accounting periods). Otherwise,
a station may be required to make a commitment that cannot be fulfilled, thereby leading to protracted litigation.
However, in fairness to cable operators, we support NAB's proposal that broadcasters notify cable operators 60 days
prior to termination of any agreements to indemnify them for copyright liability. In particular, this will provide
sufficient time for cable operators to notify subscribers regarding the deletion of the station.
<FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>
 Further, we disagree with NCTA that to permit agreements for periods of less than three years essentially allows stations
to revert to retransmission consent. A station electing must-carry status remains a must-carry station for the entire
three-year period, but, in situations where the station is considered distant for copyright purposes, a cable operator
is not obligated to honor that election unless it receives a commitment for copyright reimbursement. Further, we
note that where a station does not initially meet the criteria for must-carry status, it subsequently may assert its
rights once it satisfies the conditions for must-carry status.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
48. In a related matter, we find it appropriate to require cable operators to notify a broadcaster of any change in service
that will have an unexpected change on the amount of copyright reimbursement that will be required to maintain its
must-carry status. For example, as petitioners point out, there are some circumstances where a permitted signal
subject to a .563% royalty rate may become a penalty station and require a payment of 3.75% of the system's gross revenues.
We believe it is reasonable to expect a cable operator to inform a must-carry station when the estimated cost of continued
carriage may change. We also agree with NAB that it is inappropriate for broadcasters whose stations do not cause a
copyright liability for the cable system to be required to commit to indemnification before such liability is actually
incurred. In both cases, a change in a station's potential copyright liability may affect its decision whether to
retain its must-carry status by indemnifying the cable operator or to cede its must-carry rights. Accordingly, we
will require cable operators to notify broadcast stations at least 60 days prior to any unexpected change on their
copyright status. This will allow sufficient time for the station to determine whether it wishes to continue carriage
and, if not, it will give the cable operator enough time to send out the required notice of deletion of a signal. However,
the broadcast station must indemnify the cable operator for costs incurred during that copyright accounting period,
but not for additional costs once the broadcaster has notified the cable operator that it will discontinue must-carry
status in light of changes proposed, but not yet effectuated, by the cable operator.

 INTV and NAB request clarification regarding the method for determining the incremental copyright liability attributable
to a particular station. We indicated in the Report and Order that increased copyright liability should be specifically
associated with the carriage of each station and further that ``stations should be counted in the order they satisfy
all the necessary conditions for attaining must-carry status.'' However, this statement does not accurately reflect
the reality of copyright liability, nor does it adequately address the concern that cable operators may have the ability
to manipulate the liability of stations which have been historically carried on the system, or which are added pursuant
to must-carry. We note that NAB is correct in stating that the copyright liability is determined according to the sequence
by which the signal is added to the system. Section 111(d) of Title 17 provides the method for calculating copyright
royalties to be paid by a cable system. In addition, the copyright rules provide specific information regarding statements
of account and methods of computation for the payment of copyright royalties. We agree with NCTA that the copyright
rules determine the manner in which the cable operator will have to pay royalties for each station carried.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
50. In an effort to eliminate confusion in making the determination of increased liability associated with each station,
we believe that stations which were carried prior to the implementation of must-carry should continue to be accounted
in the same manner with respect to the sequence of signal carriage. Stations which were or are added by the system should
have their copyright liability based on the sequence by which the signal was or is added to the system. In the event multiple
signals are added on the same day, the sequence of incremental increase in liability should be based on the order in
which the stations met all necessary conditions for attaining must-carry status. We anticipate that providing the
station with the statement of account filed with the Copyright Office will ensure the station the opportunity to review
how this process is achieved. Therefore, we decline to adopt an alternative system for determining the copyright
liability of individual stations' carriage on a cable system.

51. The Commission's must-carry requirements became effective on June 2, 1993, during a Copyright Office accounting
period.
<FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>
 Prior to the implementation of the must-carry rules, carriage of any station was at the discretion of the cable operator.
In such cases, the cable operator carried such a signal even though it incurred a copyright liability for the period
ending June 30, 1993. That liability did not increase due to a change in our regulations for stations which had previously
been carried, and therefore the liability had already been assumed. We do not believe it appropriate to require the
broadcast station to reimburse for that liability, even if carriage became mandatory on June 2, 1993. However, with
respect to a broadcast station which was not previously carried by the cable system and which immediately asserted
its must-carry rights on June 2, 1993, we believe that such station should reimburse the cable operator for any increased
copyright liability incurred as a result of adding that signal between June 2, 1993 and June 30, 1993. Therefore, in
the case of a station that agreed to be added on June 2 and committed to indemnification, the station is responsible
for the whole semiannual fee. In particular, the station had the opportunity to postpone satisfying the conditions
of must-carry status until the first day of the next Copyright Office accounting period.

52. INTV seeks to establish a rebuttable presumption that all stations are significantly viewed throughout their
ADIs. We recognize that there may be some merit in considering alternative procedures for addressing significant
viewing showings and that there may be both policy and efficiency reasons for attempting to parallel ADI and significant
viewing service area decisions. The INTV proposal, however, is in our view sufficiently novel that it is not appropriately
considered in the context of this proceeding. This is particularly the case since the significant viewing process
has ramifications in terms of other rules, such as the network nonduplication rules, that are not the subject of this
proceeding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2. Remedies
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
53. Section 615(d)(1) and Section 615(j) provide for the resolution of carriage and channel positioning disputes
between a broadcast station and a cable operator. With respect to commercial stations, the 1992 Cable Act requires
a local commercial station to notify the cable operator of an alleged violation, and requires the cable operator to
respond to such a notice, prior to the station's filing a complaint with the Commission. However, with respect to NCE
stations, the 1992 Cable Act permits a NCE station to file a complaint with the Commission prior to notifying the cable
operator. In the Report and Order we discussed these provisions and adopted rules for their implementation. Upon
review of those rules, we find it necessary to make some adjustments on our own motion, as they relate to the filing of
a complaint by a NCE station.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
54. As indicated above, a NCE station is not required to notify a cable operator prior to filing a complaint with the
Commission. In the Report and Order, we stated that ``it is anticipated, though not required, that if there is any question
relating to the carriage obligations of the cable system, the NCE station will make inquiries of the cable system prior
to filing a complaint.'' We also stated that if a NCE station wanted to follow the procedures outlined for complaints
filed by a commercial broadcasting station, it could do so as long as it notified the cable system of such intent. In
establishing the time frames by which any broadcaster (commercial, noncommercial or LPTV) should file a complaint,
we stated that such complaint should be filed within 60 days of an ``affirmative action'' by a cable operator which
directly affects the carriage rights of a broadcast station. We then proceeded to define ``affirmative action''
as the denial by a cable operator of a request for either carriage or channel position, or the failure of a cable system
to respond to such a demand within the required 30-day time frame. It appears that by establishing such a 60-day requirement
based upon an ``affirmative action,'' we have made the complaint procedure for NCE stations more rigorous than was
intended, either by our rule or the intent of the 1992 Cable Act. Therefore, for the purposes of a NCE station complaint,
we are revising &sect;76.7 to allow a NCE station to file a complaint at any time it determines that its carriage rights
have been violated. We believe this better reflects the language of the 1992 Cable Act and will eliminate the possibility
that a NCE complaint would be dismissed based solely on a failure to meet the 60-day time frame, prior to having the merits
of the complaint considered.

55. Section 325(b)(1) provides that ``no cable system or other multichannel video programming distributor shall
retransmit the signal of a broadcasting station, or any part thereof, *&blank;*&blank;* ``except with express authorization
of the station or if carried pursuant to must-carry. Section 602(12) of the Communications Act defines a multichannel
video programming distributor as ``a person such as, but not limited to, a cable operator, a multichannel multipoint
distribution service (MMDS), a direct broadcast satellite service, or a television receive-only satellite program
distributor, who makes available for purchase, by subscribers or customers, multiple channels of video programming.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
56. In the Report and Order we found that ``local broadcast signals provided by MATV facilities or by VHF/UHF antennas
on individual dwellings situated within the station's broadcast service area are not subject to retransmission
consent, provided that these signals are available without charge at the resident's option.'' We further stated
that this exemption applies to MATV&hyph;SMATV, MMDS&hyph;SMATV and MMDS-individual antenna combinations, so
long as there is no charge. The analogy used was that of an individual purchasing and installing a roof top antenna to
receive broadcast signals. This exception to retransmission consent was added to the Commission's rules as &sect;76.64(e).
That section states that ``[p]rovision of local broadcast signals my master antenna television (MATV) facilities
or by VHF/UHF antennas on individual dwellings is not subject to retransmission consent, provided that these signals
are available without charge at the resident' option. That is, the antenna facilities must be owned by the individual
subscriber or building owner and not under the control of the multichannel video programming distributor.'' On October
5, 1993, at the request of the Wireless Cable Association (``WCA'') and the National Private Cable Association (``NPCA''),
we adopted a Stay Order with respect to &sect;76.64(e), pending our resolution of this issue. The determining factor
used in the rule relates to antenna ownership, not the provision of the service free-of-charge.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
57. We note that a wireless operator meets the definition of a multichannel video programming distributor (``MVPD'')
and generally would be responsible for obtaining retransmission consent for all broadcast signals retransmitted
over their system. We are cognizant of Congress' desire not to affect a viewer who receives these broadcast signals
over an antenna not owned by a MVPD. The application of the retransmission consent requirement to MMDS and SMATV facilities
was an effort to create regulatory parity between these types of operations and cable systems. In the Report and Order,
the Commission expressed its belief that to the extent the signal reception involved was under the control of the individual
subscriber and the signals involved were not being ``sold'' by the MMDS and SMATV operators, the consent requirement
should not apply. In addition, and in recognition of the concerns raised by WCA, we find that retransmission consent
is not required if the broadcast signal reception service is received without a separate subscription charge and
the antenna is either (1) owned by the subscriber or the building owner; or (2) under the control and available for purchase
by the subscriber or building owner upon termination of service. We believe that this interpretation upholds Congressional
intent without causing undue disruption to subscribers. We will amend &sect;76.64(e) of our rules to reflect this
change.

B. The Scope of Retransmission Consent
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1. Radio
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
58. In the Report and Order we concluded that Congress intended to provide retransmission consent to all broadcast
signals, including those retransmitted by radio. Petitions for reconsideration argue that the retransmission
consent provisions of Section 325 and the must-carry provisions of Sections 614 and 615 were intended to work in concert
and, therefore, because the must-carry provisions apply only to broadcast television signals, Congress intended
retransmission consent to apply only to broadcast television signals. Cable operators argue that most cable systems
carry radio stations as an all-band offering, meaning that as with any standard radio receiver, all stations which
deliver a signal to the antenna are carried on the system. They contend that the refusal of one radio station to grant
consent would preclude all other radio stations from being carried in the all-band method. Several commenters assert
that cable operators are more likely to drop the all-band radio offering, rather than attempt to bargain for retransmission
consent from all stations carried.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
59. We continue to believe that Section 325, as amended by the 1992 Cable Act, applies to radio signals as well as television
signals. The statutory language and the legislative history support this conclusion and we have not been presented
with a credible argument for reading the statute otherwise. Section 325(b)(2) expressly exempts certain broadcast
stations from the consent provision, and radio stations are not included in these exceptions. However, with respect
to the difficulty of obtaining consent for all stations carried in an all-band method, we believe that cable system
have a legitimate concern. In order to make possible the offering of an ``all-band'' FM radio service, cable operators
need only seek the consent of stations within the usual reception area of a high power FM station. Therefore, cable
systems must obtain consent from all stations which are located within 92 km (57 miles) of the cable system's receiving
antenna(s). The distance of 92 km was selected as a result of the Commission's allotment policies relating to FM radio
stations. Because the predicted service contour of a Class C FM radio station is 92 kilometers, the use of such a distance
will ensure that retransmission consent is obtained from FM radio stations received by the cable system's receiving
antenna(s). Other stations, in the absence of specific notice to the contrary, will be presumed to be insufficiently
present to be considered carried in the all-band reception mode. This should eliminate concern over obtaining consent
from signals which fade in and out of an all-band offering due to atmospheric conditions. We note that although the
cable operator is not required to obtain retransmission consent from stations outside the 92 km zone, any such station
that is received and retransmitted by the cable system may affirmatively refuse to grant, or negotiate for compensation
in return for granting, retransmission consent to the cable operator. Alternatively, a cable system may choose to
use a filtering device to eliminate those radio stations from an all-band offering for which the cable operator is
unable or unwilling to obtain consent. This change will be reflected in Section 76.64 of our rules, under a new subpart
(n).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Low Power Television Stations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
60. In concluding in the Report and Order that low power television stations are entitled to retransmission consent,
we stated that low power television stations are ``television broadcast stations.'' We incorrectly stated, however,
that a low power station meets the definition of television broadcast station in &sect;76.5 of our rules. Section
76.5(b) defines television broadcast station as ``any television broadcast station operating on a channel regularly
assigned to its community by &sect;73.606 of this chapter *&blank;*&blank;*.'' A low power television station,
defined in Section 74.701(f), however, is authorized under subpart G of Part 74 of our rules. However, we continue
to believe that the statute was clear that low power television stations are entitled to assert retransmission consent
over their signals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Exceptions to the Retransmission Consent Requirement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
61. Section 325, as amended by the 1992 Cable Act, provides four exceptions to retransmission consent. Section 325(b)(2)
states that retransmission consent shall not apply to the retransmission of NCE stations, retransmission directly
to a home satellite antenna, the retransmission of the broadcast signal of a network directly to a home satellite antenna
of an unserved household, or the retransmission of the signal of a superstation if such signal was obtained from a satellite
carrier and the originating station was a superstation on May 1, 1991. Petitions for reconsideration have been filed
regarding the interpretation of the fourth exception.

62. On May 26, 1993, the Commission adopted an Order, 58 FR 32452 (6/10/93), denying a Request for Stay submitted by
Yankee Microwave, Inc. (``Yankee''). In subsequent pleadings Yankee requested reconsideration of that Order,
or alternatively, the immediate grant of its petition for reconsideration. Yankee sought relief, on behalf of its
cable system customers, from the provisions of &sect;76.64(b)(2) regarding the superstation exception. Alternatively,
Yankee requested revision of that section of our rules so it would apply to microwave carriers of a superstation signal,
as well as to satellite carriers of such a signal. By Order of the Chief, Mass Media Bureau, a temporary waiver was granted
to Yankee upon a finding by the Bureau that Yankee would suffer irreparable harm if the provisions of the rule were enforced
prior to our decision on the pending petitions for reconsideration. On October 5, 1993, the Mass Media Bureau adopted
an Order which denied a similar request filed by EMI, Inc. (``EMI'') primarily based on that party's lack of a showing
of imminent harm. We now address the requests and oppositions raised by parties to this proceeding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
63. In the Report and Order we rejected arguments that the retransmission consent requirement should not apply to
superstation signals delivered via terrestrial means such as microwave. Petitions for reconsideration argue that
the effect of the rule is to unfairly discriminate in favor of satellite carriers to the detriment of alternative delivery
methods such as microwave. We are persuaded by commenters that the unintended effect of the rule is to unfairly discriminate
against alternative methods of delivery of a superstation signal. We believe, consistent with the stated purpose
and intent of the 1992 Cable Act, that it is the delivery of satellite signals, not the manner of delivery which should
be excepted from the retransmission consent requirement. In other words, if a superstation meets the definition
of ``superstation'' contained in the Copyright Act, then the manner of delivery of such a signal shall not control.
However, as discussed more fully below, the exception will only apply to delivery of such a superstation signal outside
the local market of the station.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
64. Rights of superstations within the local market. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 614 defines a local commercial broadcast station as any full power commercial television broadcast station
licensed by the Commission that is located in the same television market as the cable system. As long as the local commercial
broadcast station delivers a good quality signal and agrees to indemnify the cable system for any additional copyright
liability, the station is entitled to must-carry rights within the local market. Otherwise, that station has the
right, pursuant to Section 325(b) (4)&hyph;(5), to elect retransmission consent. Section 325 states that the term
``superstation'' shall be defined according to Section 119(d) of Title 17 of the United States Code. Section 119(d)
of Title 17 defines a superstation as ``a television broadcast station other than a network station, licensed by the
Federal Communications Commission that is secondarily transmitted by a satellite carrier.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
65. We believe that Congress intended for all local commercial broadcast stations to have the option to assert either
must-carry or retransmission consent within their individual market. These local commercial broadcast stations
do not become superstations until such time as they are retransmitted via satellite outside their market, an activity
unrelated to their status as local commercial broadcast stations within their market. Therefore, such local commercial
stations retain the right to elect between must-carry and retransmission consent within their market.

C. Must-Carry/Retransmission Consent Election and Implementation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
66. Section 325(b)(3)(B) provides that television stations must make an election between must-carry and retransmission
consent ``within one year after the date of enactment'' and every three years thereafter. In the Report and Order we
established the implementation of these provisions indicating that the initial election for must-carry or retransmission
consent must be made by June 17, 1993. We also provided that subsequent elections must be made by October 1, 1996, October
1, 1999, etc., and would become effective on January 1, 1997, January 1, 2000, etc. We determined that broadcasters
were to send copies of their election to the cable operator and were to retain copies of such elections in their public
files. We failed, however, to instruct television broadcast stations on the term of retention. Consistent with the
requirements of the 1992 Cable Act and other recordkeeping provisions of &sect;&sect;73.3526 and 73.3527 of our
rules, we will require television broadcast stations to retain election statements in their public files for the
term of the three year-election period applicable to such election statements. We will amend &sect;&sect;73.3526
and 73.3527 to indicate not only the need to include such information in the station's public file, but also the three-year
retention period for such election statement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
67. In the Report and Order we noted that no party had commented on our proposal to require a new television station to
make an initial must-carry/retransmission consent election within 30 days from the date that it commences regular
broadcasts. We adopted that proposal, as well as an effective date of ninety (90) days following the election. In considering
this provision further, we believe that such an election schedule could have a detrimental effect on a new television
station which is entering the market. The Commission's rules provide that a television station which has completed
construction may commence program tests prior to filing for a license with the Commission. These stations generally
know in advance the date they plan to commence broadcasting. On our own motion, we therefore alter the initial election
and effective date with respect to new television broadcast stations. A new television station shall elect between
must-carry and retransmission consent sixty (60) days prior to commencing program tests, and shall notify the cable
operator of that election. In the event that must-carry status is elected, the new station shall also include its channel
position in the election statement to the cable operator. The election statement should be sent to the cable operator
by certified mail, return receipt requested. The initial election of the broadcast station shall take effect ninety
(90) days after it is made. This will provide the cable operator with sufficient time to notify subscribers of any change
which may be required in the channel line-up of the system. The result will be that a new television broadcast station
will have the opportunity to be carried on a cable system 30 days after it commences broadcasts over-the-air. We believe
that such a result serves the public interest and provides new broadcast stations with appropriate access to enable
them to effectively enter a market. Section 76.64(f)(4) of our rules is being revised to reflect this change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
68. In the Report and Order we failed to provide for the introduction of a new cable system in a market. Consistent with
the purpose of the 1992 Cable Act, a new cable system will be required to notify all local commercial and noncommercial
broadcast stations of its intent to commence service. The cable operator must send such notification, by certified
mail, at least 60 days prior to commencing cable service. Commercial broadcast stations must notify the cable system
within 30 days of the receipt of such notice of their election of either must-carry or retransmission consent with
respect to such new cable system. If the commercial broadcast station elects must-carry, it must also indicate its
channel position in its election statement to the cable system. Such election shall remain valid for the remainder
of any three-year election interval, as established in &sect;76.64(f)(2). Noncommercial educational broadcast
stations should notify the cable operator of their request for carriage and their channel position. The cable system
must determine, in advance of commencing service on the system, whether a station is delivering a good quality signal
and/or if a station will be required to indemnify for copyright purposes. The cable system must notify the broadcaster
of any signal quality problems or copyright liability and must receive the station's response to such information
prior to commencing carriage of the station's signal. These provisions are being added to our rules as &sect;76.64(l).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
69. In the Report and Order we rejected the tentative conclusion of the Notice that cable operators could negotiate
with broadcasters to carry less than the entire program schedule of a retransmission consent station. We interpreted
Section 614(b)(3)(B) and the legislative history as not permitting negotiation for carriage or partial broadcast
signals. On October 5, 1993, at the request of various parties to this proceeding, we stayed the rule requiring carriage
in the entirety for retransmission consent signals. Section 76.62(a) of the rules requires the carriage of the entire
program schedule of any television station carried by a cable system. The rule applies to stations carried pursuant
to Sections 614, 615 or 325. The only exception to this ``carriage in its entirety'' requirement is specific programming
that is prohibited under &sect;76.67 (sports blackout rule) or subpart F of Part 76 of our rules (network nonduplication
and syndicated exclusivity). In the Stay Order we granted a stay, with respect to stations carried pursuant to Section
325 (retransmission consent stations), of the new &sect;76.62(a). The stay was issued in response to a request by
Media-Com, the licensee of a low power television station located in Akron, Ohio. Media-Com requested a waiver of
the provision to permit it to continue part-time carriage on a Warner Cable system under a private agreement. We granted
the stay in an effort to avoid an interim loss to the public of its present cable access while we considered petitions
for reconsideration with respect to the carriage in the entirety issue. We stated in the Stay Order that we would resolve
this issue in this Memorandum Opinion and Order. Petitioners request reconsideration of the requirement for carriage
in the entirety with respect to retransmission consent signals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
70. First, we continue to believe that, with respect to stations which have elected must-carry status, Section 614(b)(3)
requires cable operators to ``carry the entirety of the program schedule of any television station carried on the
cable system *&blank;*&blank;*.'' As discussed in the Report and Order, the legislative history indicates that
carriage in the entirety was intended for those local commercial broadcast signals entitled to must-carry status
under Section 614. Indeed, the legislative history is replete with discussions relating to the must-carry provisions,
the need for adequate carriage of local broadcast stations on cable systems and the controlling market power of cable
systems. Congress was concerned that such market power not overwhelm the ability of local broadcast stations to obtain
carriage, and that the terms of carriage not be unreasonable.
<FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>
 Congress indicated its strong belief that absent the must-carry provisions, local broadcast stations would not
be readily available to cable subscribers. In the Senate Report, Congress stated that ``it is for this reason that
the legislation incorporates a special provision focusing just on the carriage of local broadcast signals. Moreover,
this provision addresses both the primary concern of carriage and the secondary concerns of the terms of carriage.
Based on these concerns, we believe that all qualified local commercial broadcast stations should have the minimal
protection afforded by Section 614. Further, we also continue to believe that any broadcast station that is eligible
for must-carry status, although it may be carried pursuant to a retransmission consent agreement must, therefore,
be carried in the entirety, unless carriage of specific programming is prohibited, pursuant to our rules relating
to network nonduplication, syndicated exclusivity, sports programming or similar regulations.

The Conference Report states that ``the must-carry and channel positioning provisions in the bill are the only means
to protect the federal system of television allocations, and to promote competition in local markets *&blank;*&blank;*.
Given the current economic condition of free, local over-the-air broadcasting, an affirmative must-carry requirement
is the only effective mechanism to promote the overall public interest.''

71. The Report and Order concluded that Section 614(b)(3) requires carriage in the entirety of any broadcast station
carried on the cable system. However, upon reconsideration, we believe that the ability of a broadcaster and cable
system to negotiate and agree to carriage of less than the entire signal is permitted only where Section 614 is inapplicable.
Specifically, as pointed out by NCTA, Section 614 applies only to qualified local commercial television signals
(including qualified LPTV stations), and does not apply to either non-local or non-qualified local commercial broadcast
signals. Therefore, where the broadcaster's signal is not eligible for must-carry rights, either by failure to meet
the requisite definitions or because the broadcast station is outside the local market (ADI), and where, therefore
Section 614 is inapplicable, the broadcaster's rights to freely negotiate for the carriage of that signal pursuant
to retransmission consent includes the right to negotiate for partial carriage of the signal.

72. Section 325 states that no cable system or other multichannel video programming distributor shall without consent
retransmit ``the signal of a broadcasting station, or any part thereof, *&blank;*&blank;*'' In contrast, Section
614(b)(3)(B), the must-carry provision, states that the cable operator shall carry ``the entirety of the program
schedule *&blank;*&blank;*.'' Further, Section 325(b)(4) states that if a station elects retransmission consent,
``the provisions of section 614 shall not apply to the carriage of the signal of such station by such cable system.''
While, at first blush, the statutory language appears to permit broadcasters to negotiate with cable operators for
retransmission consent for any part of their signal (i.e., any programs), we now believe that a more correct and harmonious
reading of Section 614 and 325 together leads to an interpretation that Congress intended cable systems to carry all
the programming of must-carry eligible stations regardless of whether the broadcast station opts for must-carry
status or not. While it is clear under Section 325 that some negotiated partial carriage is permitted, Section 325
does not mandate the availability of partial carriage in all negotiations. Given this fact, and the congressional
emphasis on full carriage for must-carry qualified stations (discussed above), we believe the statutory provisions
read in concert suggest that qualified must-carry stations should, as a matter of policy, be carried in their entirety
even if they are carried pursuant to retransmission consent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
73. This interpretation is bolstered by Congress' direction to the Commission in Section 325(b)(3)(A) to fashion
``regulations to govern the exercise by television broadcast stations of the right to grant retransmission consent
under this subsection and of the right to signal carriage under section 614.'' By including this provision in Section
325, we believe that Congress recognized the interplay between the two sections and gave the Commission authority
to fill in regulatory gaps. Thus, at the very least, the Commission has the flexibility to require carriage in the entirety
for qualified must carry stations carried pursuant to retransmission consent to ensure that the basic underlying
objectives of the 1992 Cable Act relating to local broadcast service would be fulfilled. Otherwise, the statutory
goals at the heart of Sections 614 and 325_to place local broadcasters on a more even competitive level and thus help
preserve local broadcast service to the public_could easily be undermined.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
74. The Senate Report confirms this interpretation by stating that the ``rights granted to stations under section
325 and under section 614 and 615 can be exercised harmoniously, and it anticipates that the FCC will undertake to promulgate
regulations which will permit the fullest applications of whichever rights each television station elects to exercise.''
We believe that our rules should provide the wildest possible range of opportunity for both broadcast stations and
cable operators, where the must-carry provisions are not applicable. Thus, any station which is eligible for must-carry
status must be carried, if at all, in its entirety regardless of whether the station elects must-carry or retransmission
consent. Similarly, any station which is not eligible for must-carry status under Section 614, because it is not a
local commercial broadcast station, or does not qualify under the definitions of Section 614, may negotiate for partial
carriage. Thus, we conclude, based upon a reading of both Sections 614 and 325, that broadcast stations whose signals
are entitled to must-carry but are instead carried pursuant to retransmission consent are not permitted to negotiate
for carriage of less than their entire signal. We note that this interpretation of the statute is supported by the legislative
history which notes that the retransmission consent provision was drafted in such a way as to promote the ``established
relationships between broadcasters and cable systems,'' and to ``minimize unnecessary disruption to broadcasters
and cable operators.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
75. The 1992 Cable Act was specific in stating that ``[c]able systems carrying the signals of broadcast stations,
whether pursuant to an agreement with the station or pursuant to the provisions of [must-carry], will continue to
have the authority to retransmit the programs carried on those signals under the section 111 compulsory license.''
The Committee emphasized that nothing in the 1992 Cable Act was ``intended to abrogate or alter existing program licensing
agreements between broadcaster and program suppliers, or to limit the terms of existing or future licensing agreements.''

76. We continue to intepret retransmission consent as a new right given to the broadcaster under the terms of the 1992
Cable Act and as a right separate from the right of the underlying copyright holder and do not believe that our reconsideration
decision in any way undermines the separate nature of these rights or creates a conflict between communications and
copyright based policies. Congress indicated that it intended ``to establish a marketplace for the disposition
of the rights to retransmit broadcast signals.'' As stated in the Report and Order, the right involved is one which
may be freely bargained away in future programming contracts. Although NAB and INTV argue that carriage in the entirety
is required to ensure the continued validity of both the retransmission consent right and the current compulsory
copyright, we do not see how providing broadcasters and cable operators with additional flexibility to negotiate
retransmission agreements for signals not eligible for must-carry status algers the nature of the rights granted
under Sections 325 and 614 in any way. Indeed, according this additional flexibility is consistent with interpreting
the right in question as a new right subject to the control of the station licensee. To the extent these rights have been
bargained away, the remaining rights that have not been disposed of still remain under the control of the station involved.
As noted in paragraph 99, a contrary interpretation would not only deprive broadcasters and cable operators of the
ability to negotiate mutually advantageous arrangements for the carriage of portions of distant signals but would
negate the functioning of various portions of Section 111 of the Copyright Act and of the Commission's rules which
specifically contemplate the possibility that portions of distant signals may be carried. Accordingly, we interpret
Section 325 to provide that broadcasters may bargain with cable operators for the right to carriage of any part of the
broadcast signal provided that such station is not eligible under the provisions of Section 614, either because it
is not a local commercial broadcast signal or it does not qualify for mandatory carriage. ``Carriage in the entirety''
remains a requirement with respect to signals eligible for mandatory carriage under the provisions of Section 614.
Sections 76.62(a) and 76.64(k) are being revised to reflect this change.

77. In the Report and Order we specifically prohibited exclusive retransmission consent agreements between television
broadcast stations and cable operators. This provision forbids a television station from making an agreement with
one MVPD for carriage, exclusive of other MVPDs. After reviewing the comments filed in response to the Notice, we concluded
that this prohibition is necessary in light of the concerns that led Congress to regulate program access and cable
signal carriage agreements. We then stated that we would revisit the issue in three years. We reject petitioners arguments
that prohibiting exclusive retransmission consent agreements is not warranted and is not supported by the 1992 Cable
Act. We are adding a new paragraph (m) to &sect;76.64 of our rules to reflect this decision. As we indicated in the Report
and Order, we will consider the need for such a prohibition against exclusive retransmission consent agreements
in three years.

Retransmission Consent and Network Nonduplication Protection.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the Report and Order, we concluded that local television stations electing retransmission consent should continue
to be entitled to invoke network nonduplication or syndicated exclusivity protection, whether or not they are carried
by the cable system. Commenters had sought to eliminate exclusivity rights for stations choosing retransmission
consent. We found, however, that the legislative history addressed this matter and that Congress intended for exclusivity
protection to apply under its regulatory framework.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
79. We affirm our decision to allow stations electing retransmission consent to assert network nonduplication or
syndicated exclusivity protection as provided in the rules.
<FOOTCITE>26</FOOTCITE>
 We observe that this issue was considered earlier in this proceeding in response to a petition from NCTA, which we denied
in the Report and Order. Parties have provided no new arguments nor additional evidence to convince us that our decision
conflicts with the intent of Congress. We also do not find that there is a conflict between retransmission consent
rights and exclusivity rights. Network nonduplication and syndicated exclusivity rights protect the exclusivity
that broadcasters have acquired from their program suppliers, including their network partners, while retransmission
consent allows broadcasters to control the redistribution of their signals. Both policies promote the continued
availability of the over-the-air television system, a substantial government interest in Congress' view.

We note that we also considered whether to modify the geographic zone applicable to exclusivity protection to make

to make such a change.

80. We also note that cable operators believe that broadcasters have an advantage in the negotiations for retransmission
agreements due to their ability to assert their exclusivity rights, while broadcasters believe the reverse. Local
broadcast stations are an important part of the service that cable operators offer and broadcasters rely on cable
as a means to distribute their signals. Thus, we believe that there are incentives for both parties to come to mutually
beneficial arrangements. Moreover, the allegations that local stations electing retransmission consent would
not be carried due to their inability to successfully negotiate agreements with cable operators and then assert their
exclusivity rights and deprive subscribers of programming was speculative at the time the reconsideration petitions
were filed. Now that the retransmission consent provisions are in effect, there is no evidence that subscribers are
being deprived of network programming. We note that there are only limited situations where local stations are not
carried. Therefore, the dire consequences predicted do not exist and we continue to believe that stations should
receive the exclusivity protection to which they are entitled.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing interim regulations to clarify its intentions concerning the
assessment of interest on monies due the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program when a comprehensive medical
plan (CMP) submits defective cost or pricing data to support its community rate. This clarification is necessary
because a few FEHB Program carriers are misinterpreting OMP's current regulations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Recent final audit reports on community-rated plans issued by OPM's Office of Inspector General include monetary
findings based on interest income lost to the FEHB Program because of FEHB Program carrier overcharges. A few carriers
have questioned the period covered by the interest charges assessed by OPM. Specifically, they question OPM's policy
of charging interest on the overcharges from the date the Government pays the inflated rate to the date of the carrier's
full repayment to the Government. They believe that, in the absence of a specific contractual provision, OPM should
charge interest not from the date of the overpayment by the Government, but from 30 days after its first written demand,
as provided in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) general interest clause at 52.232&hyph;17. Because the
monetary findings are significant in value, OPM is issuing these regulations to clarify its policy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In FEHB Program contracts with CMP's using community rates, premiums and subscription income are determined on the
basis of community rating. A community rate is deemed the equivalent of the FAR's description of an established catalog
or market price. Each CMP certifies to the accouracy of its pricing; or, if granted an exemption by OPM, represents
that all the statements made on or attached to its SF 1412, Claim for Exemption from Submission of Certified Cost or
Pricing Data, are correct. If, upon audit, it is determined that the rates are not correct and the carrier has overcharged
the FEHB Program, OPM assesses an interest charge in accordance with FAR 52.215&hyph;23, Price Reduction for Defective
Cost or Pricing Data_Modifications. This provision allows the contracting officer to charge simple interest on
the amount of the overpayment computed from the date the overpayment is made to the contractor to the date the Government
is repaid by the contractor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAR 52.215&hyph;23 applies to contract modifications involving a price adjustment exceeding $100,000, but does
not apply to modifications for which the price is (1) based on adequate price competition; (2) based on established
catalog or market prices of commercial items sold in substantial quantities to the general public; or (3) set by law
or regulation. OPM applies this clause as follows: A community rate is deemed the equivalent of an established catalog
or market price; however, the defective community rates constitute that part of the quoted rate that does not fall
within the catalog or market part of the price. Had the carrier priced the FEHB contract correctly according to the
catalog or market price, this clause would not become operative. The defective portion of the rate is not a market or
catalog price; that is, the defective portion is a modification to the catalog or market price. Since the carrier did
not comply with the terms of its submission, it is responsible for correcting the price so that it is the catalog or market
price and for making the government whole by paying interest from the date the government was overcharged.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By restating this interest provision in a specific clause in the FEHB Program acquisition regulations at FEHBAR 1652.215&hyph;70,
OPM makes it clear that its policy is to charge interest from the date it pays the carrier the higher rate to the date the
full repayment is made to OPM.

Waiver of Notice of Proposed Rulemaking

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 553(b)(3)(A) of title 5 of the U.S. Code, I find that good cause exists for waiving the general notice
of proposed rulemaking. The notice is being waived because the regulations simply interpret rules and clarify OPM's
current policy with respect to the assessment of interest on amounts that become payable by the contractor to the FEHB
Fund.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 All three species are endemic to the slopes of Haleakala on the island of Maui, Hawaiian Islands. The three plant species
and their habitats have been variously affected or are currently threatened by habitat degradation and damage to
plants by feral and domestic animals (cattle and/or pigs), and/or by competition for space, light, water, and nutrients
by naturalized, introduced vegetation. Due to the small number of existing individuals and their very narrow distributions,
these species and their populations are vulnerable to reduced reproductive vigor and/or an increased likelihood
of extinction from stochastic events. This final rule implements the Federal protection and recovery provisions
provided by the Act.

 members of the citrus family (Rutaceae), are endemic to the slopes of Haleakala on the island of Maui, Hawaiian Islands.
The island of Maui comprises remnants of two large shield volcanoes, the older West Maui Volcano on the west and the
larger and much younger Haleakala Volcano on the east. These two volcanoes and the connecting isthmus formed by lava
flows make up an island 1,888 square kilometers (sq km) (729 sq miles (mi)) in area. Haleakala, on East Maui, erupted
just 200 years ago and has an elevation of 3,055 meters (m) (10,023 feet (ft)). Haleakala still retains its classic
shield shape and has somewhat less diverse vegetation than the older and more eroded West Maui Mountains. Rainfall
on Haleakala averages about 890 centimeters (cm) (350 inches (in)) per year, with the mountain's windward (northeastern)
slope receiving the most precipitation. However, Haleakala's inner crater is a dry cinder desert because it is above
the level at which precipitation develops and is sheltered from moisture-laden winds (Gagne and Cuddihy 1990).

climate is warm, and frequent afternoon fog often results in fog drip. Substrates are volcanic with well developed
soil. This is a highly stratified community, comprising, in order of canopy height: koa (up to 40 m tall); 'ohi'a (up
to 30 m tall); several native tree species (10 to 20 m tall);

 is a sprawling shrub with long, slender branches covered with gray hairs when young and becoming hairless when older.
New growth is covered with many fine, yellowish to golden brown hairs. The opposite, widely spaced, leathery to papery,
elliptic leaves measure 1.5 to 6.5 cm (0.6 to 2.6 in) long and 1 to 4 cm (0.4 to 1.6 in) wide and have petioles 0.6 to 1.6 cm
(0.2 to 0.6 in) long. Both upper and lower surfaces of mature leaves are hairless. Each flower cluster is on a main stalk
13 to 17 mm (0.5 to 0.7 in) long and comprises one to three flowers on individual stalks usually 4 to 8 mm (0.2 to 0.3 in)
long. Only female flowers have been observed, and each consists of four sepals about 3.5 mm (0.1 in) long, four petals
about 5 mm (0.2 in) long, an eight-lobed nectary disk, eight reduced and nonfunctional stamens, and a hairless four-celled
ovary. The 14 to 15 mm (0.6 in) wide fruit is made up of 4 distinct follicles (dry fruits splitting along one side) 7 to
7.5 mm (0.3 in) long. Sepals and petals remain attached to the mature fruit. The endocarp (inner fruit wall) and the
wrinkled exocarp (outer fruit wall) are both hairless.

 has been found only on the island of Maui on the southwestern slope of Haleakala. Two plants, separated by an unspecified
distance, were found by Forbes in 1920. Today, one of these plants is still known to exist near Puu Ouli on privately
owned land; the other plant has not been relocated. This species typically grows in Olopua Lowland Mesic Forest with
hala pepe as a co-dominant at elevations between 914 and 1,200 m (3,000 and 3,900 ft). Associated taxa include

and/or extinction from stochastic events due to the existence of only one population and one known individual. Competition
with alien introduced plants such as Hilo grass and strawberry guava, susceptibility to black twig borer, and habitat
degradation and damage to plants by feral goats and axis deer are potential threats (HHP 1992e, 1992f; L. Cuddihy and
A. Medeiros, pers. comms., 1992).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Federal action on these plants began as a result of section 12 of the Act, which directed the Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution to prepare a report on plants considered to be endangered, threatened, or extinct in the United States.
This report, designated as House Document No. 94&hyph;51, was presented to Congress on January 9, 1975. In that document,

A 1-year grace period was given to proposals already over 2 years old. On December 10, 1979, the Service published a
notice in the

 (44 FR 70796) withdrawing the portion of the June 16, 1976, proposal that had not been made final, along with four other
proposals that had expired. The Service published an updated notice of review for plants on December 15, 1980 (45 FR

Because specimens collected in the past few years were recently verified as being these three species, they are confirmed
extant and are being listed as endangered.

For petitions presenting substantial information that listing may be warranted, section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act requires
the Secretary to make a finding on whether the petitioned action is warranted within 12 months of receipt of the petition.
Section 2(b)(1) of the 1982 amendments further requires all petitions pending on October 13, 1982, be treated as having
been newly submitted on that date. On October 13, 1983, the Service found that the petitioned listing of these species
was warranted but precluded by other pending listing actions, in accordance with section 4(b)(3)(B)(iii) of the
Act. Notification of this finding was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 20, 1984 (49 FR 2485). Such a finding requires the petition to be recycled pursuant to section 4(b)(3)(C)(i)
of the Act. The finding was reviewed in October of 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1991. Publication of
the proposed rule constituted the final one-year finding for these species.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The native vegetation of East Maui has undergone extreme alterations because of past and present land management
practices, including deliberate alien plant and animal introductions and agricultural development (Scott

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

to the three species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cattle, introduced to Maui in the early 1800s, were permitted to range freely and subsequently became quite numerous.
Cattle have converted large tracts of forest to open pasture on southern and northwestern Haleakala. Feral cattle
consume native vegetation, trample roots and seedlings, accelerate erosion, and promote the invasion of alien plants
(Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Stone 1985). Along with goats, cattle are considered one of the two most damaging alien vertebrates
to Hawaii's native ecosystems. The long history of cattle grazing has so altered the southern slope of Haleakala that
only pockets of native vegetation remain (Scott

 grows in an area used for grazing, and cattle are considered an immediate threat to the species (A. Medeiros, pers.
comm., 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Goats were introduced to Maui by the early 1800s and are now a serious threat to the integrity of Maui's forests. The
impact of goats on the native vegetation is similar to that described for cattle (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Stone 1985).
Although they have now been removed, feral goats entered Kipahulu Valley in the past and could become a threat to

Axis deer cause habitat degradation by trampling, consuming, and overgrazing vegetation. This process removes
ground cover and often results in soil erosion. Alien plant taxa are then able to exploit the newly disturbed areas
(Cuddihy and Stone 1990). Axis deer have become established at low elevation slopes of western and southern Haleakala
and may become a threat to mesic and wet native forests on Haleakala. They are a potential threat to all three endangered
species of

In contrast to goats and cattle, pigs typically occupy the wetter regions of Hawaii's forests and are one of the major
current modifiers of wet forest habitats. Pigs damage native vegetation by their rooting and trampling activities.
This process encourages the ingress of alien plants, which are able to exploit newly disturbed soil better than native
taxa. In addition, these animals disseminate alien plant taxa through their feces and on their bodies (Cuddihy and
Stone 1990, Stone 1985). Pigs have severely damaged fragile and limited communities, such as that of

by pigs remains a threat to these two species (HHP 1992b, 1992d, 1992f; L. Cuddihy and R. Hobdy, pers. comms., 1992).

 Unrestricted collecting for scientific or horticultural purposes and excessive visits by individuals interested

species, none of which has more than a total of two populations or 10 known individuals. Collection of whole plants
or reproductive parts of these species could cause an adverse impact on the gene pool and threaten the survival of the

 The black twig borer is a small beetle about 1.6 mm (0.06 in) in length that burrows into branches, introduces a pathogenic
fungus as food for its larvae, and lays its eggs. Twigs, branches, and even an entire plant can be killed from such an

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conservation district lands are regarded, among other purposes, as necessary for the protection of endemic biological
resources and the maintenance or enhancement of the conservation of natural resources. Requests for amendments
to district boundaries or variances within existing classifications can be made by government agencies and private
landowners (HRS, sect. 205&hyph;4). The Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources is mandated to initiate
changes in conservation district boundaries to include ``the habitat of rare native species of flora and fauna within
the conservation district'' (HRS, sect. 195D&hyph;5.1). Hawaii environmental policy, and thus approval of land
use, is required by law to safeguard ``*&blank;*&blank;* the State's unique natural environmental characteristics
*&blank;*&blank;*'' (HRS, sect. 344&hyph;3(1)) and includes guidelines to ``Protect endangered species of individual
plants and animals *&blank;*&blank;*'' (HRS, sect. 344&hyph;4(3)(A)). However, none of the three species in this
rule is presently protected under the State's endangered species act, and, despite provisions for conserving endemic
resources, individual rare species may be overlooked during consideration of other land use priorities. Even if
all other threats were removed by virtue of occurrence and protection on Federal land or in conservation districts,
these species are still in danger of extinction due to their low numbers.

grass, withstands trampling and grazing and produces thick mats that choke out other plants and prevent their seedlings

(O'Connor 1990; Smith 1985; A. Medeiros, pers. comm., 1992). The perennial Hilo grass, naturalized in moist to wet,
disturbed areas on most Hawaiian Islands, produces a dense ground cover, even on poor soil, and is a potential threat

develops into stands in which few other plants grow and physically displaces natural vegetation. Pigs depend on strawberry
guava for food and in turn disperse the plant's seeds through the forests (Smith 1985, Wagner

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

Valley and is a potential threat to

Stochastic events such as human-set fires and wildfires destroy native Hawaiian vegetation and usually favor fire-resistant
alien plants (Cuddihy and Stone 1990). Fire is a potential threat to

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past,
present, and future threats faced by these species in issuing this rule. Based on this evaluation, the preferred action
is to list these three species as endangered. The species consist of only 1 or 2 populations each and 1 to approximately
10 known individual plants. They are threatened by habitat degradation and damage to plants by feral or domestic animals
and by competition from alien plants. Small population size and limited distribution make these species particularly
vulnerable to reduced reproductive vigor and/or extinction from stochastic events. Because these three species
are in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of their ranges, they fit the definition of endangered
as defined in the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Critical habitat is not being designated for the three species included in this rule for reasons discussed in the ``Critical
Habitat'' section of this final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Critical Habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary
propose critical habitat at the time the species is proposed to be endangered. The Service finds that designation
of critical habitat is not presently prudent for these species. All three species have extremely low total populations
and face anthropogenic threats. The listing of these species as endangered publicizes the rarity of the plants and,
thus, can make the species attractive to researchers, curiosity seekers, or collectors of rare plants. The publication
of precise maps and descriptions of critical habitat in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and local newspapers as required in a designation of critical habitat would increase the species' vulnerability
to take or vandalism and, therefore, could contribute to their decline and increase enforcement problems. Protection
of the species' habitat will be addressed through the recovery process and through the section 7 consultation process.
All involved parties and the landowners have been notified of the importance of protecting the habitat of these species.
Two of the three species are found in Haleakala National Park where Federal law protects all plants from damage or removal.
It is highly unlikely that Federal activities in the National Park would directly affect the continued existence
of these two species. Therefore, the Service finds that designation of critical habitat for these species is not prudent
at this time because such designation would increase the species' vulnerability to vandalism, collecting, or other
human activities and because it is unlikely to aid in the conservation of the species.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Available Conservation Measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act include recognition,
recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain activities. Recognition
through listing encourages and results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and local agencies, private organizations,
and individuals. The Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with the State and requires that
recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions
against certain activities involving listed plants are discussed, in part, below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species
that is proposed or listed as endangered and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations
implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section 7(a)(2) requires
Federal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued
existence of an endangered species or to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may
affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency must enter into formal consultation
with the Service. One species (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Melicope ovalis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) is located only in Haleakala National Park. One population of another species (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. balloui
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) is also found in this park. Laws relating to national parks prohibit damage or removal of any plants growing in the
parks. There are no Federal activities that are known to occur within the present known habitat of these three plant
species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.61, 17.62, and 17.63 set forth a series of general prohibitions
and exceptions that apply to all endangered plant species. With respect to the three 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Melicope 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
species listed as endangered by this rule, all prohibitions of section 9(a)(2) of the Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.61,
would apply. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United
States to import or export such species to/from the United States; transport such species in interstate or foreign
commerce in the course of a commercial activity; sell or offer for sale such species in interstate or foreign commerce;
remove and reduce to possession such species from areas under Federal jurisdiction; maliciously damage or destroy
any such species on any area under Federal jurisdiction; or remove, cut, dig up, damage, or destroy any such species
on any other area in knowing violation of any State law or regulation or in the course of any violation of a State criminal
trespass law. Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies. Section 10 of the
Act and 50 CFR 17.62 provide for the issuance of permits under certain circumstances to carry out activities involving
endangered plants that are otherwise prohibited by section 9. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the policy of the Service (59 FR 34272) to identify to the maximum extent practicable at the time a species is listed
those activities that would or would not be likely to constitute a violation of section 9 of the Act. Such information
is intended to clarify the potential impacts of a species' listing on proposed and ongoing activities within the species'
range. Two of the species occur on National Park Service lands. Collection, damage or destruction of these species
on Federal lands is prohibited without a Federal endangered species permit. Such activities on non-Federal lands
would constitute a violation of section 9 if conducted in knowing violation of Hawaii State law or regulations or in
violation of a State criminal trespass law (see Hawaii State Law section below). The Service is not aware of any trade
in these species or of any activities currently being conducted by the public that will be affected by this listing
and result in a violation of section 9. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requests for copies of the regulations concerning listed plants and general inquiries regarding prohibitions and
permits may be addressed to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Ecological Services, Endangered Species Permits,
911 N.E. 11th Avenue, Portland, Oregon 97232&hyph;4181 (503/231&hyph;2063; FAX 503/231&hyph;6243).

Federal listing will automatically invoke listing under the State's endangered species legislation. Hawaii's
Endangered Species Act states, ``Any species of aquatic life, wildlife, or land plant that has been determined to
be an endangered species pursuant to the [Federal] Endangered Species Act shall be deemed to be an endangered species
under the provisions of this chapter *&blank;*&blank;*'' (HRS, sect. 195D&hyph;4(a)). The State law prohibits
cutting, collecting, uprooting, destroying, injuring, or possessing any listed species of plant, or attempting
to engage in any such conduct. State law also encourages conservation by State agencies. Laws relating to the conservation
of biological resources allow for the acquisition of land as well as the development and implementation of programs
concerning the conservation of biological resources (HRS, sect. 195D&hyph;5(a)).

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is promulgating the use of several new analytical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods and updated versions of previously approved methods for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of regulated contaminants in drinking water. At the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time, the Agency is withdrawing approval of outdated methods or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outdated versions of the same methods. The purpose of the rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is to approve new methods, withdraw outdated methods, and update 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
older methods for analysis of regulated contaminants in drinking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water. The rule is expected to eliminate unnecessary duplication 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by withdrawing older versions of the same method, and satisfy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public requests for approval of new technologies in drinking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water analyses.

The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), as amended in 1986, requires EPA to promulgate national primary drinking water
regulations (NPDWRs) which specify maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) or treatment techniques for drinking water
contaminants (42 U.S.C. 300g&hyph;1). NPDWRs apply to public water systems (42 U.S.C. 300f(1)(A)). According to
section 1401(1)(D) of the Act, NPDWRs include ``criteria and procedures to assure a supply of drinking water which
dependably complies with such maximum contaminant levels; including quality control and testing procedures. *&blank;*&blank;*''
In addition, Section 1445(a) of the Act authorizes the Administrator to establish regulations for monitoring to
assist in determining whether persons are acting in compliance with the requirements of the SDWA. EPA's promulgation
of analytical methods is authorized under these sections of the SDWA as well as the general rulemaking authority in
SDWA Section 1450(a) (42 U.S.C. 300j&hyph;9(a)).

II. Regulatory Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has promulgated analytical methods for all currently regulated drinking water contaminants for which MCLs or
monitoring requirements have been promulgated. In most cases, the Agency has promulgated regulations specifying
(i.e., approving) use of more than one analytical method for a contaminant, and laboratories may use any one of them
for determining compliance with an MCL or monitoring requirement. After any regulation is published, EPA may amend
the regulations to approve additional methods, or modifications to approved methods, or withdraw methods that become
obsolete.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 15, 1993, EPA proposed to approve the use of several new methods and modifications of existing methods
that EPA believed were as good as, or better than, current methods and procedures (58 FR 65622). The Agency also proposed
to withdraw approval for outdated methods or outdated versions of the same methods. In addition, EPA published a Notice
of Availability (NOA) (59 FR 35891) on July 14, 1994, to make available data from EPA's evaluation of several new analytical
methods, and to propose withdrawal of approval for several outdated EPA methods. EPA requested public comments on
the proposal and on the NOA. Today's notice takes final action on the methods covered by the proposal and the NOA.

III. Explanation of Today's Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With a few minor exceptions, which are described below, the actions described in the 1993 proposed rule and the 1994
NOA are approved in today's rule. The coliform transit time will remain at 30 hours, and the Agency will not require
systems to hold samples at 10 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C during transit. EPA will approve the Colisure test for simultaneously determining the presence of total coliforms
and

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In the July 1994 NOA, EPA described the new versions of EPA Methods 200.7, 200.8, 200.9, 245.1 (EPA, 1994a) and 504.1
(EPA, 1993d) that are approved in today's rule. Mercury and sodium have been added to the analytical scope of Methods
200.8 and 200.7, respectively. EPA is approving EPA Method 508.1 (EPA, 1994c), which allows liquid-solid extraction
(LSE) procedures to be used under Method 508 conditions for analysis of many analytes contained in EPA Methods 507
and 508. A minor revision to dioxin method 1613 that allows use of LSE is approved. Hexachlorocyclo-pentadiene has
been added to the analytical scope of EPA Method 508.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Trimethylsilyldiazomethane may be used as an alternative derivatizing reagent in Methods 515.1 and 515.2. EPA Methods
150.1, 150.2 and 515.1 are not withdrawn. Turbidity measurements of samples need not be made immediately before beginning
an analysis for metals; it is only necessary that the sample be acidified and held for sixteen hours. For EPA Method
531.1 (carbamates), samples no longer need to be frozen, thereby eliminating the possibility of frozen samples breaking
the sample vial. Standard Method 6610 is approved as an alternative to Method 531.1. Analysis for 2,3,7,8&hyph;TCDD
(dioxin) with Method 1613, or for asbestos with Method 100.1 or 100.2 can be simplified by using the guidance contained
in the EPA document, Technical Notes on Drinking Water Methods (EPA, 1994d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technical Notes

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contains mandatory and optional procedures that will be cited in the drinking water regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is also correcting minor errors in the 1993 proposal. An erroneous listing of USGS methods I&hyph;2822&hyph;85
and I&hyph;2823&hyph;85 for sulfate, and ASTM D2036&hyph;91A for cyanide are removed in today's rule. The ASTM method
had been listed twice in the table of approved methods. A typographical error occurred in listing the USGS method for
silver and the ASTM method for chloride. The correct listings are USGS I&hyph;3720&hyph;85 (silver) and ASTM D4327&hyph;91
(chloride).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The effective date for all actions in this rule, except withdrawal of obsolete methods, is January 4, 1995. The withdrawal
date for obsolete methods is July 1, 1996 (or 18 months from publication, whichever is later), which is a year later
than proposed. After this date, EPA's manual ``Methods for Chemical Analysis of Water and Wastes'' (EPA, 1983a) will
contain only three approved drinking water methods_Methods 150.1, 150.2, and 245.2. To spare new laboratories the
expense of purchasing this manual, EPA will provide single copies of these methods to users who do not have a copy of
the 1983 manual. For the convenience of readers and for clarity of the rules, methods that are withdrawn will be specified
only by tabulating them in the document, Technical Notes on Drinking Water Methods (EPA, 1994d), and in the next revision
of the Manual for the Certification of Laboratories Analyzing Drinking Water (EPA, 1990b).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA received 136 comments on the December 15, 1993, proposal; 92 comments were related to chemical-analytical methods
and 79 comments were related to the methods associated with the coliform and surface water treatment rules. The Agency
received twenty comments on the July 14, 1994, Notice of Availability. The commenters included analytical laboratories,
water utilities, analytical instrument manufacturers, State and local regulators, and trade associations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A summary of major comments and the Agency's response to the issues raised are presented in this section. The Agency's

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA Method 100.2 (asbestos)&blank;Four comments contained several suggestions and criticisms. Method 100.2 has
been editorially revised to reflect the comments. These changes, however, do not affect the performance, cost or
applicability of the method. One commenter asked EPA to approve SM 2570 for asbestos, which was published in a 1994
supplement to the eighteenth edition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Standard Methods
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (APHA, 1994). EPA does not approve SM 2570 for asbestos in today's rule, because this method differs in significant
ways from Method 100.2. For example, SM 2570 uses a larger pore filter (0.45 micron) to trap asbestos fibers, while
EPA method 100.2 uses a 0.22 micron filter. The commenter did not provide any data comparing asbestos trapping efficiency
of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these two filters, whereas EPA has data (EPA, 1994e) to show that larger pore-size filters trap fewer asbestos fibers
in drinking water samples. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Method 552.1&blank;A commenter asked that the sodium hydroxide rinse in Method 552.1 be optional, because the rinse
is not compatible with their LSE product. Method 552.1 was developed and validated with ion exchange cartridges to
take advantage of the special chemical properties of dalapon and the other acids 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
covered by the method. To efficiently extract the acids the ion exchange resin must be activated with a sodium hydroxide
rinse. Sorbent conditioning and elution steps, which are specified in Method 552.1 or any LSE method, cannot be modified
or eliminated to accommodate the support material. Thus, EPA will not allow the sodium hydroxide rinse in Method 552.1
to be optional, because EPA has received no data to support the commenter's request to make the rinse optional. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The same commenter asked for a more generic definition of LSE media in Method 552.1 and in other LSE methods. The commenter
believes EPA is unnecessarily narrowing the choice of LSE disks and cartridges. EPA does not believe LSE methods are
overly restrictive in allowing use of alternative LSE disks or cartridges. However, EPA believes that additional
guidance to help users correctly choose alternative LSE media without compromising the reliability of the analysis
would be useful. The guidance is summarized below and will be published in Technical Notes on Drinking Water Methods
(EPA, 1994d). The guidance is applicable to all LSE methods and supersedes the phrase ``or equivalent'' that is used
in some methods to describe selection of alternative LSE cartridges or disks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Liquid-solid extraction is performed using various sorbents that are either packed into a cartridge or enmeshed
in a disk of inert support material. EPA methods describe the cartridge or disk that was used to develop the LSE procedure,
and to produce the data which is published in the method. If a product is mentioned in the methods, it is for information
purposes only. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes various LSE cartridges and disks may be used, provided they meet all quality control requirements of
the method, and provided they contain a sorbent that uses the same physicochemical principles as the cartridge or
disk that is described in the approved LSE method. To demonstrate that alternative LSE cartridges and disks meet all
quality control criteria, the analyst must be aware of the chemistry of the method. For example, in evaluating Method
552.1 the recovery of the free acid (not a chemical derivative) from the water sample must be tested with the alternative
LSE cartridge or disk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In judging LSE disk media, both the sorbent and the support must be evaluated. In the case of sorbents, similarities
in polarity are not sufficient. For example, a C
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
18
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-Silica sorbent may not perform the same as a styrene divinylbenzene copolymer sorbent. Thus, these sorbents would
not be considered to be equivalent. In judging supports, any physical support used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hold the sorbent is acceptable provided the support is inert and compatible with the solutions or solvents required
in the conditioning and elution steps of the method. However, any sorbent conditioning or elution steps, which are
specified in the method must not be modified or eliminated to accommodate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
support material.

EPA Method 555&blank;Several commenters noted that the method detection limits (MDLs) for some analytes were greater
than MDLs in the alternative method (EPA Method 515.1), or were too high to meet monitoring triggers, which are specified
at 40 CFR 141.24(h)(18). Thus, they questioned whether Method 555 was a suitable alternative to Method 515.2. EPA
believes commenters mistakenly looked at MDLs in Table 2 of Method 555, which shows the results of spikes at 10 ppb.
However, spikes at 0.5 ppb (Table 5 in the method) resulted in MDLs that are equivalent to Method 515.1 MDLs, and these
MDLs have been validated in a second laboratory (EPA, 1992a). EPA also notes that monitoring triggers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for several organic contaminants, including Method 555 analytes, may be amended in a future rulemaking (EPA, 1993b,
1994f). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Great Lakes Instruments (GLI) Method 2 (turbidity)&blank;Some commenters objected to the method because it is vendor
and instrument-specific. EPA generally develops and approves methods that are not vendor-specific. Users are not
limited to the GLI method; generic methods SM 2130B and EPA 180.1 are approved for turbidity. However, under the Alternative
Test Procedures (ATP) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program EPA has approved vendor-specific methods or products as alternatives to approved methods (53 FR 5142, February
19, 1988). GLI Method 2 was evaluated under EPA's ATP program and recommended for approval as an alternative method.
EPA realizes GLI is the source of copies of GLI Method 2, which is a factor a laboratory choosing to adopt this method
must consider. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters believed the GLI method should be approved as a version of an international procedure, ISO 7027. The
ISO procedure measures turbidity via either 90
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; scattered or transmitted light depending on concentration. Although 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instruments conforming to ISO 7027 specifications are similar to the GLI instrument, only the GLI instrument uses
pulsed, multiple detectors to simultaneously read both 90
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; scattered and transmitted light. EPA has received no data on the ISO 7027 use of separate 90
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; scattered or transmitted light measurements to judge equivalency to other approved turbidity methods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SM 4500&hyph;Cl&hyph;E, Low Level Amperometric Titration&blank;A commenter noted a typographical error in a calculation
in SM 4500&hyph;Cl&hyph;E, which the Standard Methods Committee has agreed to correct. In approving SM 4500&hyph;Cl&hyph;E,
EPA will print the correct formula for SM 4500&hyph;Cl&hyph;E in Technical Notes on Drinking Water Methods (EPA,
1994d). The Standard Methods Committee will publish a correction to this method in the next (19th) edition of Standard
Methods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Eaton, 1993a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SM 6610 (APHA, 1994)&blank;A commenter asked to approve this method as an alternative to EPA Method 531.1. EPA aided
the development of this method, which was published in 1994 in a supplement to the eighteenth edition of Standard Methods.
EPA agrees with the commenter, and will approve SM6610 for analysis of aldicarb, aldicarb sulfone, aldicarb sulfoxide,
carbaryl, carbofuran, 3-hydroxycarbofuran, methomyl, and oxamyl. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA Method 1613, Revision B, dioxin (EPA, 1994i)&blank;EPA was asked to replace the approved Revision A of Method
1613 with Revision B. EPA agrees with the suggestion. As with Revision A, users can greatly simplify use of Revision
B of Method 1613 when only 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2,3,7,8&hyph;TCDD) is to be determined in drinking
water samples by using procedures described in Technical Notes on Drinking Water Methods (EPA, 1994d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA proposed Revision A of Method 1613 for the monitoring of several chlorinated dioxins and furans under the Clean
Water Act on February 7, 1991 (56 FR 5090), and approved it only for measurement of 2,3,7,8&hyph;TCDD under the Safe
Drinking Water Act on July 17, 1992 (57 FR 31803). In response to comments on the 1991 proposal, EPA developed Revision
B. The only technical changes made in Revision B that affect determination of 2,3,7,8&hyph;TCDD in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drinking water matrices are (1) slight changes in performance specifications based on the compilation of data from
interlaboratory and other studies, (2) additional language intended to provide analysts with increased flexibility
to use liquid solid extraction procedures, and (3) further clarification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the documentation required when analysts employ the flexibility provided in the method to use alternate techniques
not explicitly described in the method.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments on expanding the analytical scope of these five 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods were favorable. These methods, EPA Methods 200.8, 200.9, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
300.0, SM 4110B, and American Society for Testing and Materials 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ASTM) method D4327&hyph;91, were discussed in the 1993 proposal or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 1994 NOA. Specific comments requesting that approved methods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cover additional analytes are described and answered below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter asked EPA to expand the scope of Method 200.8 to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include additional metals that are not currently regulated by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA. While EPA encourages laboratories to use any approved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method for all contaminants that are within the analytical scope 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the method, EPA can only approve a method for contaminants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are regulated. One commenter asked why Method 200.9 did not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include the secondary drinking water contaminant, zinc. EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes analysis of zinc with Method 200.9 is impractical, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the instrument and procedure used are very sensitive to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small amounts of lead. The analysis is subject to random 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contamination, and the concentration range of zinc that can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reliably measured is too narrow to be of use with typical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drinking water samples. EPA recommends more suitable methods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(EPA 200.7, 200.9, SM 3120B and SM 3111B) for measurement of zinc 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in drinking water samples. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters were concerned about expanding the scope of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ion chromatography methods to include fluoride. They believed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that EPA did not have data to show that interference problems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not preclude use of ion chromatography for the analysis of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fluoride in drinking water samples. EPA's 1990 study (Bionetics) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which involved participation of seventeen laboratories 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrated that fluoride can be reliably measured in drinking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water samples with ion chromatography. Thus, EPA has no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hesitation in approving the three proposed ion chromatography 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods for the analysis of fluoride in drinking water.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 1993 proposal or the 1994 NOA. Problems were reported by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter with the use of trimethylsilyldiazomethane (TMSD) for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
derivatization of the analytes in Methods 515.1 and 515.2. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter suggested that EPA also allow the use of diazomethane 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for this purpose. EPA agrees with the commenter and, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussed in the 1993 proposal, EPA allows use of either 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
derivatizing reagent. However, because dalapon is not adequately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
derivatized by TMSD, the use of TMSD in Method 515.1 is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved for analysis of dalapon. Procedures for using TMSD with

to add other regulated metals to the scope of Method 200.7, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because use of a new axial configured inductively coupled plasma 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ICP) atomic emission spectroscopy (AES) instrument improves the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sensitivity of the method to the required regulatory limits. EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not approve this request in today's rule, because Method 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
200.7 as written allows use of other types of ICP/AES instruments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that cannot meet the regulatory limits for the additional metals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To extend the scope of Method 200.7 as suggested by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters would require either a formal ATP approval (EPA, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993c), or publication of a new AES method that allowed only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instruments with an axial configuration.

1991 Organic Methods Manual (EPA, 1991)&blank;One commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested a change in the scope of EPA Method 505 because of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detection limits for some method analytes. These changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included withdrawal of alachlor, atrazine and simazine, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition of toxaphene. EPA is evaluating the detection limits in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
several methods. When this evaluation is complete, EPA may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
propose to withdraw approval of methods or modify the scope of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods, such as Method 505. In the interim, EPA does not agree 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the scope of Method 505 should be changed to withdraw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alachlor, atrazine and simazine. However, EPA agrees that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis for these nitrogen-containing compounds may require use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a nitrogen-phosphorous detector (NPD) rather than the electron 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capture detector (ECD). Today's rule specifies that an NPD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be substituted for the ECD in Method 505 (or another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved method should be used) to determine alachlor, atrazine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and simazine, if lower detection limits are required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA agrees with the comment about toxaphene. In today's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule EPA is correcting an omission in the 1993 proposal by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuing to approve Method 505 for toxaphene. However, EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notes that the Method 505 MDL for toxaphene is very close to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MCL. To improve the sensitivity of the analysis analysts may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wish to use Method 508 for toxaphene and other Method 505 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analytes for which use of an NPD will not improve the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sensitivity. Method 508 is very similar to Method 505 except 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the MDLs are lower, because a larger sample volume is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extracted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MCL compliance determination for PCBs requires that EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method 505 or 508 be used as a screen for PCBs as Aroclors prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to quantitation as decachlorobiphenyl by EPA Method 508A. Three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters requested that EPA switch the sequence of compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods for PCBs, i.e., use Method 508A to screen and Method 505 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or 508 to quantify PCBs. The suggested change in the sequence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance methods is beyond the scope of this rule since it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would require amending the MCL compliance determination sequence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in 40 CFR 141.24(h)(13)(i)&hyph;(iii). Only Method 508A can measure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decachlorobiphenyl, and &sect;141.24(h)(13)(ii) specifically requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``using Method 508A to quantify PCBs as decachlorobiphenyl''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It was suggested by a commenter that EPA include hexachloro- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cyclopentadiene (HCP) in the scope of EPA Method 508. EPA agrees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the commenter, and will allow measurement of HCP with EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Method 508. However, the analyst must show that the analyte 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recoveries and other criteria, which are specified for HCP in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 9 of Method 508.1 are achieved using Method 508 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures. This option will be described in the document, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technical Notes on Drinking Water Methods (EPA, 1994d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993 EPA Inorganic Methods Manual (EPA, 1993a)&blank;A commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asked what the differences were between Method 335.3 and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
updated version, Method 335.4, since both versions require manual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distillation of the sample to prepare it for measurement of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cyanide. The technical differences between these methods are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minor. EPA improved the automation of procedures in Method 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
335.4, and added the option to use a labor-saving distillation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedure. The distillation option is described in Method 335.4, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and it is approved and described for other spectrophotometric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods in Technical Notes on Drinking Water Methods (EPA, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters objected to replacement of Method 335.3 with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
335.4. The objection appeared to be based on the mistaken belief 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that Method 335.4 requires a manual distillation of the sample to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepare it for measurement of cyanide and that the earlier 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
version, Method 335.3, did not. EPA has never allowed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spectrophotometric measurements of cyanide in water samples 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without manual distillation of the sample using SM 4500&hyph;CN&hyph;C (cf. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR 136.3, Table 1B; 59 FR 4507, January 31, 1994; and 57

FR
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
31839, July 17, 1992). Commenters may have been misled by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussion in Method 335.3 of an alternate ultraviolet (UV) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
digestion procedure that does not require manual distillation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has never approved this optional UV procedure for compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurements of cyanide, because EPA has no data to show that UV 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
digestion would not provide inaccurate results that underestimate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the level of contamination. To avoid manual distillation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sample, laboratories may use a selective electrode method for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cyanide.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA notes that the ``amenable'' spectrophotometric methods, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ASTM D2036&hyph;91B and SM 4500&hyph;CN&hyph;G, also require distillation prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to either free or total cyanide measurements. To further clarify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's intent to require manual distillation for all spectrophotometric determinations of cyanide, these methods
will be listed at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR 141.23(k) in today's rule under the phrase ``Manual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distillation followed by''. Immediately following this phrase, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the rules specify use of SM 4500&hyph;CN&hyph;C to conduct this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distillation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The vast majority of comments on the eighteenth edition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
version of microbiology methods concerned the maximum time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between sample collection and analysis (transit time) of drinking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water samples. Commenters opposed reducing this time from 30 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hours (16th edition of Standard Methods) to 24 hours (18th 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
edition of Standard Methods). The Standard Methods committee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduced the transit time because of its concern about coliform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
die-off in the sample over time. Commenters opposed reducing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time because it would (1) be logistically impractical if not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impossible to do, (2) increase costs for sample transport and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resampling, (3) cause hardships in sample collection, and (4) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complicate and decrease laboratory flexibility. A few commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claimed that the reduced transit time is not supported by data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Coliforms usually die off over time, especially when water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperatures are warm, but EPA recognizes that there is debate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
among investigators over the rate of that decline. EPA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently conducting additional studies on this question, using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fecal coliforms and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
E. coli
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and results are anticipated by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
end of 1994. Given the logistical and other problems that might 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result by decreasing the transit time to 24 hours, EPA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deferring a decision on whether to reduce the transit time until 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more data become available. For the time being, the Agency has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
added a footnote to the Table in &sect;141.21(f)(3), allowing a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum transit time of 30 hours. If EPA decides that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction from 30 hours is warranted, the Agency will work with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the States to minimize the hardships identified in the public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments. Meanwhile, EPA strongly encourages States and systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to review their procedures and identify practical alternatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for providing samples to laboratories more quickly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters objected to the requirement in the 18th 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
edition of Standard Methods to hold samples at less than 10 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during transit. The Standard Methods committee specified this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value because of its concern about coliform die-off in the sample 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at higher temperatures, where the bacterial metabolism of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coliforms and non-coliforms alike is normally greater. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters objected to any EPA requirement that would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require them to keep samples cool during sample transit. They 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asserted that this requirement would (1) be unnecessary and would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complicate sample transport logistics, (2) increase sampling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs and shipping costs for both systems and laboratories, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because coolers and ice packs cost money and samples are heavier 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and thus more expensive to ship, and (3) lead to problems with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frozen samples or a significantly increased number of invalid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
samples. Commenters also stated that under the presence-absence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concept, sample cooling was less important than under the earlier 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule based on coliform density. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is deferring a decision on sample transit temperature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
until the Agency initiates a review, and possible revision, of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Total Coliform Rule. For the time being, the Agency has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
added a footnote to the Table in &sect;141.21(f)(3) encouraging, but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not requiring, systems to hold samples at less than 10 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transit. Nevertheless, the Agency strongly encourages systems to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cool their samples during transit, especially during warm summer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
months, to minimize coliform die-off. The Agency is currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducting additional studies on this question, using fecal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coliforms and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
E. coli
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and results are anticipated by the end of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994. If EPA decides that a reduction is warranted, the Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will work with the States to minimize the hardships identified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the public comments.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is also approving a new method, the Colisure test, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
simultaneously determining the presence of total coliforms and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
E. coli,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 both of which must be monitored under the Total Coliform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule (40 CFR 141.21). Data supporting the use of this method was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presented in the notice of July 14, 1994 (NOA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most commenters supported approval of the Colisure test, but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
several raised questions about the test, primarily concerning the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incubation time. They cited the Broadway et al. (1992) data that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicated that only 64% and 69% of the bottles were total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coliform-positive and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
E. coli
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-positive, respectively, after 24 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hours compared to the 48-hour results. According to the Broadway 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
et al. data, 85% and 88% of the bottles were total coliform-positive and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
E. coli
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-positive, respectively, after 28 hours compared to the 48-hour results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA agrees with the commenters who contended that 24 hours 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of incubation was insufficient for the Colisure test. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency, however, believes that the recovery rate after 28 hours 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is reasonable, and will approve the Colisure test as a 28-hour 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test. Moreover, based on additional data from the product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer showing that the false-positive rate after 48 hours 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is small, EPA will allow laboratories to hold the test up to 48 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hours before observing results.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There were only minor comments on the proposal to update 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemistry methods to the versions contained in the 18th edition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Standard Methods. The 18th edition versions contain no or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minor changes to earlier versions, and EPA received no comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to document specific hardships in converting to 18th edition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical methods. Several commenters noted that, although 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thallium is not in the scope of SM 3113B, EPA erroneously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved SM 3113B for thallium (57 FR 31840, July 17, 1992). EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agrees and will delete this approval in today's rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter noted that the 18th edition version of SM 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4500&hyph;Cl&hyph;G omits instructions that would allow measurement of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
total residual chlorine in drinking water samples using a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
colorimetric method. The Standard Methods Committee has written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Eaton, 1993b) that an editorial omission, not a technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change, occurred in recent versions of SM 4500&hyph;Cl&hyph;G. The error 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be corrected in the next (19th) edition of Standard Methods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA corrects the error today by describing the omitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructions in Technical Notes on Drinking Water Methods (EPA, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994d).

E. Methods To Be Withdrawn and Replaced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
General Comments Received on Withdrawal of Methods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter suggested that all methods carry a ``draft'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
status for three years after publication; other commenters asked 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA to approve new methods more quickly. It would defeat EPA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intent to provide modern technology quickly, if a method had to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be published, proposed, and then kept in draft status for three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years. EPA balances this problem by allowing optional use of old 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or new methods during a transitional period, which in the case of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this rule extends to July 1, 1996 (or 18 months after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
publication, whichever is later). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters believed EPA was eliminating, or intended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to eliminate, all autoanalyzer or colorimetric methods. This is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorrect; EPA is replacing only obsolete methods with equivalent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ASTM, EPA and Standard Methods. EPA is not eliminating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
colorimetric or autoanalyzer technology for any regulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminant, except arsenic. Evidence of EPA's intent is in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993 methods manual (EPA, 1993a), which updated colorimetric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods for cyanide (335.4), nitrite and nitrate (353.2), and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sulfate (375.2). EPA has and continues to approve autoanalyzer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and colorimetric ASTM and Standard Methods for cyanide, fluoride, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nitrite, nitrate and sulfate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters stated that changing from EPA methods to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent Standard Methods and ASTM methods would be very time-consuming and expensive, but provided no specific
information to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
support this statement. EPA is withdrawing methods that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incomplete and often require users to rely on the equivalent ASTM 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or Standard Methods. Thus the change, in many cases, has already 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taken place. In other cases, there are very minor differences 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between the withdrawn and the replacement methods. EPA notes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that laboratories may continue to use a withdrawn method for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other than compliance monitoring samples. EPA's actions in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
today's rule save laboratories money, because they need only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
support one version of an ASTM, EPA, or Standard Method. Prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to this rule, laboratories were required to use methods in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14th, 16th, 17th, and 18th editions of Standard Methods, and at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least two different versions of EPA Methods 200.7 and 524.2.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA received numerous comments requesting an extension of the withdrawal date for analytical methods. The suggested
dates ranged from July 1, 1995, to July 1, 2000. Based on these comments, EPA will extend the methods withdrawal date
from July 1, 1995, to July 1, 1996 (or 18 months from publication, whichever is later), which is beyond the withdrawal
date suggested by most commenters. New methods or new versions of current methods will be approved within 30 days of
publication of the rule. This overlap in approval dates for new methods and withdrawal of obsolete methods will give
laboratories sufficient time to become certified with the new methods.

Packed-Column EPA Methods 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters generally favored withdrawal of packed column methods for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and trihalomethanes
(THMs), and replacing them with technologically advanced capillary column methods. Additional costs incurred
in supporting older, obsolete methods until EPA withdraws these methods, and the suitability of capillary columns
to handle the increasing number of regulated contaminants were cited as reasons for supporting withdrawal. The July
1, 1995, withdrawal date may be too early, as pointed out by some commenters. EPA will extend the date to July 1, 1996
(or 18 months from publication, whichever is later), to give laboratories more time to plan an orderly transition
to capillary column methods.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters asked EPA for continuation of the use of packed-column methods, if they meet current regulatory requirements.
EPA feels that packed-column methods have many drawbacks. For example, the cis and trans dichloroethene isomers
cannot be separated with the packed-columns specified for VOC analysis (Lyter, 1994). Such separation problems
with packed-column methods have limited EPA's ability to prepare samples for EPA's laboratory performance evaluation
(PE) program. To accommodate packed-column methods, separate PE samples are prepared for THMs and VOCs to minimize
THM and VOC interferences that users of packed column EPA methods will experience. If only capillary columns are approved,
EPA will have more latitude to mix VOCs and THMs in PE samples to better test laboratories with concentrations and mixtures
of THMs and VOCs, as might realistically occur in drinking waters. EPA notes that laboratories may continue to use
packed column methods for other than compliance monitoring analyses, such as routine plant operation or source evaluation
samples.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter asked why EPA proposed to withdraw THM Methods 501.1 and 501.2 in the 1993 proposal, but subsequently proposed
to continue approval of these packed column methods in the Information Collection Rule (ICR) (59 FR 6354 and 6413&hyph;6414,
February 10, 1994). In today's rule, EPA is clarifying why and how Methods 501.1 and 501.2 can and should be withdrawn
without affecting analytical needs that were described in the ICR proposal. In the ICR, EPA proposed Methods 501.1
and 501.2 only because ICR data must be gathered quickly to support pending disinfectant byproduct control regulations.
To support these regulations, EPA proposed to conduct THM monitoring at a limited number of PWS for eighteen months
beginning in 1995. Since this data must be collected by laboratories certified to conduct THM analyses, it could be
a hardship to revoke the certification of laboratories now using Methods 501.1 and 501.2. EPA notes that EPA also proposed
and encouraged laboratories to use one of the capillary column methods (EPA Methods 502.2, 524.2 and 551) to conduct
THM monitoring for the ICR. And in a subsequent disinfection byproduct rule (59 FR 38668, July 29, 1994) EPA proposed
only capillary methods for THM compliance monitoring (59 FR 38821).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As explained in the 1993 proposal and in the 1992 THM methods rule (58 FR 41344, August 3, 1993), EPA intends to and will
withdraw packed column methods for THM and VOC compliance analysis. To accommodate the special and immediate information
collection needs of the ICR, EPA is deferring withdrawal of packed column Methods 501.1 and 501.2 until July 1, 1996
(or 18 months after publication, whichever is later). This date is expected to be after the beginning of the proposed
ICR monitoring period. When the ICR rule is promulgated, certification under Methods 501.1 and 501.2 will be granted
such that the withdrawal date will not impede collection of THM data for the ICR.

Colorimetric Methods for Arsenic_A commenter requested that EPA not withdraw colorimetric methods for arsenic.
Because the detection limits of these methods are very near the MCL for arsenic, colorimetric measurements do not
provide a reliable indication of variability of, or trends in, ambient concentrations of arsenic in the water supply
when these concentrations are less than the MCL. EPA believes the detection limit deficiency warrants withdrawal
of colorimetric methods for arsenic.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, since EPA approves other methods that measure all twelve regulated metals, including arsenic, it is
not cost-effective to measure arsenic separately with a colorimetric method. The cost of a complete, broad-spectrum
metals analysis by atomic absorption or ICP is not reduced if arsenic is not included. And EPA knows of no situation
where arsenic is the only metal to be determined in a compliance sample. EPA believes that there is no scientific reason
or economic need for a colorimetric method that only measures arsenic. However, EPA notes that withdrawal of these
methods does not preclude their use for other than compliance monitoring samples.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA Methods 208.2 and 354.1_A commenter asked EPA to replace EPA Methods 208.2 (barium) and 354.1 (nitrite) with the
equivalent methods SM 3113B and SM 4500&hyph;NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&hyph;B, which are published in the 18th edition of Standard Methods (APHA, 1992). EPA agrees and will withdraw Methods
208.2 and 354.1, since equivalent methods using the same equipment and procedures are approved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA Method 340.2 (fluoride)_Commenters expressed concern that withdrawal of this ion-selective electrode method
will require use of EPA Method 300.0, which requires purchase of an ion chromatograph. This is incorrect; only the
EPA ion-selective electrode method will be withdrawn. The ASTM and SM methods, which use the same equipment as the
EPA method, are approved for fluoride compliance determinations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hydrazine Methods for Nitrate and Nitrite_A commenter agreed with EPA's withdrawal of hydrazine method 353.1, stating
that the method is obsolete. The commenter, however, wanted EPA to make available at least one hydrazine method for
nitrite and nitrate by approving SM 4500&hyph;NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&hyph;H. EPA is withdrawing Method 353.1 because hydrazine is carcinogenic and toxic, and creates a significant
hazardous waste disposal problem. SM 4500&hyph;NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&hyph;H has the same problems and, therefore, cannot be approved. EPA believes users of hydrazine methods will be
able to convert easily to the approved cadmium reduction methods for nitrate and nitrite by changing their reagent
from hydrazine to cadmium when their supply of hydrazine is depleted. The cadmium methods, which have been approved
for nitrate and nitrite since 1991, use the same equipment as the hydrazine methods.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Flame AA for metals_Three commenters requested that flame atomic absorption (AA) and graphite furnace methods not
be withdrawn. EPA has not withdrawn flame AA and graphite furnace methods published by ASTM or Standard Methods; only
the obsolete EPA versions of these methods are withdrawn.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Direct Aspiration Flame AA Methods_Some commenters wanted EPA to expand the scope of these methods to include metals
other than barium and nickel. EPA cannot expand the scope, because the methods are not sensitive enough to measure
metals other than barium and nickel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Method 515.1_EPA received many comments requesting that this method not be withdrawn, primarily for two reasons.
First, neither proposed replacement method, 552.1 or 515.2, covers all of the regulated chemicals that are in Method
515.1. Secondly, the new dalapon method (552.1) requires significantly different equipment, procedures and skills
than Method 515.1. Four commenters agreed with EPA's proposal to withdraw Method 515.1, because a combination of
Methods 515.2 and 552.1 meets their regulatory needs. EPA agrees with the majority of commenters and will not withdraw
Method 515.1.

Methods for Secondary Contaminants_Some commenters believed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that delisting a secondary contaminant method precludes its use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for other than compliance monitoring samples. This is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correct; EPA does not certify laboratories for secondary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring, and EPA only recommends methods for secondary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminants. Unless State requirements provide otherwise, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratories may use methods other than those cited at 40 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

EPA Method 245.2 (mercury)_EPA was asked to withdraw this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method, which is an automated, cold vapor method for mercury. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA cannot withdraw this method because there is no other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent version of the method. Because EPA does not have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enough information to assess the effect that withdrawal of Method 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
245.2 would have, it is deferring a decision on withdrawal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA Methods 150.1, 150.2 (pH)_In the 1994 NOA, EPA proposed

to replace these methods with equivalent ASTM and Standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Methods for pH. A commenter noted that the EPA methods are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
easier to use under field conditions. The commenter indicated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that since many pH measurements are made in the field at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
point of sample collection, withdrawal of the EPA methods would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pose a significant hardship. EPA agrees with the commenter, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not withdraw these methods until ASTM or Standard Methods pH 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods are simplified for field use.

Reformat Listing of Methods in 40 CFR Parts 141 and 143_Commenters have asked EPA to improve the organization and clarity

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the drinking water regulations. Commenters have criticized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the organization of the rules, and noted difficulty in obtaining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
copies of drinking water regulations. They need the regulations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because they contain tables and lists of approved methods, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because mandatory method instructions are included in the text of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the rules and in footnotes to the tables of methods. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructions are not contained in the approved methods, because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they were developed after the method was published. In today's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule, EPA is minimizing the use of footnotes and lengthy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technical instructions in drinking water rules. EPA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplishing this by including these instructions in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
document Technical Notes on Drinking Water Methods (EPA, 1994d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This EPA publication contains mandatory procedures, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clarifications and helpful options, such as guidance on more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficient ways to conduct asbestos and dioxin compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurements. EPA will place these instructions in the affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method when the method is revised and published. EPA intends to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use this document to publish future method corrections or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modifications (after notice and comment in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as necessary). EPA believes Technical Notes will be easier for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
users to obtain, read and photocopy than the tables of approved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods in the drinking water rules. Incorporating Technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notes on Drinking Water Methods by reference in the rule has the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect of making its provisions as mandatory as those in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved drinking water methods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is improving the clarity of the rules by consolidating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listings of analytical methods. Analytical methods for THMs have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been moved from &sect;141.30 to &sect;141.24(e). Appendix C of &sect;141.30, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which contained THM Methods 501.1 and 501.2, is withdrawn 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediately, but the methods may be used for compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring under &sect;141.30 until July 1, 1996 (or 18 months from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
publication, whichever is later). And analytical methods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formerly specified for lead, copper, and corrosivity at 40 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
141.89(a) and sodium at &sect;141.41(d) are now listed with other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inorganic methods at &sect;141.23(k)(1). EPA notes that although 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sodium was removed from the list of 83 contaminants included in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 1986 amendments to the SDWA (53 FR 26487), the provisions at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;141.41 still obtain. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifications for Continuous Chlorine Monitoring Methods_Commenters favored the proposed specification for
continuous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chlorine monitoring measurements to be based on calibration with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an approved grab sample method. Two commenters asked EPA to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extend the calibration period to seven days. EPA has no data to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
support such an extension. However, the EPA protocol for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuous chlorine monitoring allows a laboratory to use an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative protocol, if it is approved by the State. EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes it is prudent for States to monitor and approve changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the EPA protocol, such as those suggested by commenters. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protocol approved in today's rule is specified at 40 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
141.74(a)(2), and allows States to grant variations, including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain changes in the chemistry of the method.

Allow Interchange of Detectors in EPA Methods 505, 507, 508_Commenters favored this proposal. Two commenters noted
that data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with alternative detectors must be verified, and were concerned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about poor ECD response of some nitrogen-containing compounds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA agrees that data must be verified when changing detectors, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and that the results for all chemicals in Methods 505, 507 or 508 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may not meet quality control requirements when an alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detector is used. This is why Section 6.8.3 of Methods 507 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
508, and Section 10.4 of Methods 505, 507 and 508 allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative detectors only if the initial demonstration of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capability criteria in Section 10 of each method is met by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative detector. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter wanted to allow use of other detectors with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA Method 504. EPA cannot approve this request, because EPA has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no data to justify use of alternative detectors in Methods 504 or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
504.1, which use an electron capture detector (ECD). The ECD has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been the only detector capable of routinely measuring EDB and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DBCP at the required parts-per-trillion concentrations (56 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3550, January 30, 1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Guidance on Preserving Samples_A commenter asked that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
biocide procedures be dropped from the VOC methods, because EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has dropped mercuric chloride as a biocide in synthetic organic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical (SOC) methods. EPA dropped mercuric chloride from SOC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods, because EPA has no data to show that biodegradation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulated SOC occurs in a typical drinking water sample, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because mercuric chloride is toxic and a hazardous waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, EPA has data to show degradation (EPA, 1994e) in samples 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collected for measurement of VOCs. The biocide procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required in the VOC methods require some combination of chilling, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rapid transit and analysis, or acidification. None of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures pose health or waste disposal problems that compare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the problems associated with preservation using mercuric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chloride. Therefore, EPA continues to require use of a biocide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in VOC methods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Liquid-Solid Extraction (LSE) in EPA Methods 507 and 508_Some commenters believed more data were needed before EPA
allowed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of LSE in Methods 507 and 508; EPA agrees. EPA stated in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
December proposal that ``the Agency regards this proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modification as tentative and will base a final decision on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether to approve on public comment and additional EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance data.'' After studying this option and developing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional data (EPA, 1994e), EPA has decided not to add LSE as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an option in Methods 507 and 508, because EPA does not have data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to support use of this technique for all of the chemicals in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods. As an alternative, EPA has developed and is approving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Method 508.1 (EPA, 1994c). Method 508.1 uses the procedures and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the electron capture detector that are used in Method 508, and it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allows use of LSE. The scope of Method 508.1 covers many of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Method 507 and 508 analytes that are subject to regulated or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unregulated contaminant monitoring requirements, but it does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include butachlor, PCBs or toxaphene. In today's rule EPA will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approve Method 508.1 for measurement of alachlor, atrazine, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chlordane, endrin, heptachlor, heptachlor epoxide, hexachloro-benzene, hexachlorocyclopentadiene, lindane,
methoxychlor, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
simazine, which are regulated SOCs. It is also approved for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aldrin, dieldrin, metolachlor, metribuzin, and propachlor, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are unregulated SOCs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Methods for Other Contaminants_In the 1993 proposal EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided guidance to systems that wish to measure chemicals that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are not regulated, and need advice on what method to use. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance stated that ``although EPA approves methods only for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminants regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency encourages laboratories to use these methods for other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminants if the method description specifically includes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these contaminants.'' One commenter mistakenly believed that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eliminates the use of other methods or techniques, such as test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kits. Although EPA encourages laboratories to save money by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using a compliance method to measure all chemicals of interest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are in the analytical scope of the method, this does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preclude systems from using other methods, including test kits, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for samples other than compliance monitoring samples.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA cautions users to carefully evaluate the performance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a method when using it for samples other than compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring samples or for contaminants not regulated under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SDWA. For example, EDB and DBCP appear in the scope of EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Methods 504.1, 502.2, 524.2 and 551. However, Methods 502.2 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
524.2 are not approved for compliance analyses, because they do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not have the sensitivity to measure compliance with the EDB and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DBCP MCLs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Methods Approval Process_Several commenters believe that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the process of proposing and approving methods or method 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modifications will always be too slow to accommodate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technical and certification needs of the laboratory community. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To solve this problem, commenters asked EPA to specify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance criteria in drinking water rules, or in the approved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods. The purpose of this would be to allow laboratories to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use any analytical method, provided it met the mandatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria. EPA agrees that the present methods approval system is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
slow. To solve this problem, EPA and other organizations are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seeking to consolidate methods across regulatory programs and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
media, and to write generic method performance criteria (EPA, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994g). A performance-based method system, as suggested by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters, might be part of the final solution. There are two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
groups working on this problem. The groups are the Intergovernmental Task Force on Monitoring, and EPA's Environmental
Monitoring Management Council. A recommendation of these groups may be for EPA to propose a new method approval and
method-writing protocol. The protocol would be designed to expedite approval of drinking water method modifications
while maintaining the degree of control needed to ensure effective enforcement of drinking water regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Field and Test Kits_Two commenters noted an omission in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule text in the 1993 proposal that appears to eliminate an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
important option. This option allows States to approve use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DPD colorimetric test kits for measurement of chlorine residuals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA did not intend to eliminate this option, and agrees the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wording in the 1993 proposal (58 FR 65631) may be misleading. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's rule clearly allows use of the DPD kits, provided the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State also approves use of the kits. This option is specified at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR 141.74(a)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter asked EPA to approve field kits for pH, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods for continuous monitoring of pH and residual chlorine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA does not need to approve field methods for pH because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently, analysis with an approved pH method may be conducted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the field or in the laboratory. Regarding continuous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring methods, in today's rule, EPA provides criteria for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuous monitoring of chlorine residuals (40 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
141.74(a)(2)). Since EPA does not require continuous pH 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring, EPA does not approve or disapprove methods for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuous measurement of pH. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Turbidity_A commenter asked that turbidity measurements, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which are specified in the drinking water regulations, be waived 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if no particulate or cloudiness is visible to the analyst. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present requirement is that turbidity be measured in all samples, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and that digestion be performed if the turbidity is one NTU or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater. EPA cannot waive turbidity measurements on samples that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appear to be clear, because samples with turbidity of up to three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NTU can appear clear to the unaided eye. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corrosivity_One commenter noted the proposed rule made no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference to updating the methods for corrosivity in 40 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
141.42(c). These methods were published in 1980 and 1982 (45 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
57346, August 27, 1980 and 47 FR 10999, March 12, 1982). In the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lead and Copper Rule (56 FR 26460, June 7, 1991), EPA agreed that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrosion control strategies could be developed or evaluated by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measuring alkalinity and other parameters (56 FR 26489 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
26496). However, the Lead and Copper Rule did not update or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specify use of the methods in 40 CFR 141.42(c). Instead, more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current methods were specified in 40 CFR 141.89(a) (56 FR 26509&hyph;26510). In today's rule, EPA eliminates possible
confusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between the requirements in 40 CFR 141.89 and 141.42 by removing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subparagraphs 40 CFR 141.42(a)&hyph;(c).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
New Technologies_Comments were received asking the Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to evaluate and develop methods based on new technologies, such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as bioassay, ELISA, and capillary electrophoresis. The Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continues to incorporate new technologies in methods, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appreciates the many articles that were sent to draw attention to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new technologies. In the last twenty years, the Agency has aided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the development of the mass spectrometer into a powerful and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
routine analytical instrument. With suggestions from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratory community (56 FR 3550, January 30, 1991), the Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moved from packed to capillary column gas chromatographic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technology, and expects to adopt innovative procedures and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instruments in future methods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 1993 proposal, EPA invited public suggestions that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA might consider approving in this rule or in a later 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking. This invitation was not meant to imply that new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods or method modifications submitted as suggestions would or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could bypass requirements that are specified at 40 CFR 141.27. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters expressed interest in having their method or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instrumentation included in EPA-approved methods. EPA suggests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that these commenters submit their data to EPA's Alternative Test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Procedures (ATP) program for evaluation. A method or instrument 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be considered for approval by EPA after it has received a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
favorable evaluation under the ATP program. A protocol for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitting ATP data is available from EPA (EPA, 1993c).

WeWWG/5880 is approved for nitrate analysis. ATI Orion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
republished the method in 1994 and renumbered it as 601, because

the 1985 manual ``Orion Guide to Water and Wastewater Analysis'', 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which contained WeWWG/5880, is no longer available. In today's

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a rule that may:

(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more, or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment,

(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements,

(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has been determined that this rule is not a ``significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory action'' under the terms of Executive Order 12866 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is therefore not subject to OMB review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires EPA to explicitly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider the effect of these regulations on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By policy, EPA has decided to consider regulatory alternatives if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there is any economic impact on any number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule is consistent with the objectives of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Flexibility Act because it will not have any economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact on any small entities. This rule specifies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analytical methods that laboratories must use for testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulated drinking water contaminants. Monitoring requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were promulgated in earlier notices. The rule would require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratories to use the most recent version of a method and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposes no additional requirements. It is actually expected to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduce cost of analysis by eliminating current requirements to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use different versions of the same method, and by allowing more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminants to be analyzed simultaneously by using a single 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method. Therefore, the Agency believes that this notice would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have no adverse effect on any number of small entities.

C. Paperwork Reduction Act

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rule contains no requests for information and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consequently is not subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44

2Lactose broth, as commercially available, may be used in lieu of lauryl tryptose broth, if the system conducts at
least 25 parallel tests between this medium and lauryl tryptose broth using the water normally tested, and this comparison
demonstrates that the false-positive rate for total coliforms, using lactose broth, is less than 10 percent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0146 intable -->
3If inverted tubes are used to detect gas production, the media should cover these tubes at least one-half to two-thirds
after the sample is added.

6The ONPG&hyph;MUG Test is also known as the Autoanalysis Colilert System.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0146 intable -->
7The Colisure Test must be incubated for 28 hours before examining the results. If an examination of the results at
28 hours is not convenient, then results may be examined at any time between 28 hours and 48 hours.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Defense, the General Services Administration, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
have agreed to an interim rule to increase the threshold for certified cost or pricing data from $100,000 to $500,000
for civilian agencies and to remove the requirements for commercial pricing certificates. This regulatory action
was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866, dated September 30, 1993.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (the Act), Pub. L. 103&hyph;355, provides authorities that streamline
the acquisition process and minimize burdensome government-unique requirements. Major changes that can be expected
in the acquisition process as a result of the Act's implementation include changes in the areas of Commercial Item
Acquisition, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, the Truth in Negotiations Act, and introduction of the Federal
Acquisition Computer Network. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice announces FAR revisions developed under FAR case 94&hyph;720, which was based on provisions in the Act
that increased the threshold for obtaining certified cost or pricing data from $100,000 to $500,000 for civilian
agencies. This matches the threshold previously applicable only to the Department of Defense, the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration, and the Coast Guard. The Act also repealed the requirements to obtain commercial pricing
certification for certain items under civilian agency contracts. This interim rule is intended solely to make the
changes necessary to implement those limited portions of the Act. Further, more extensive changes to implement other
portions of the Act will be made subsequently. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAR Council is interested in an exchange of ideas and opinions with respect to the regulatory implementation of
the Act. For that reason, the FAR Council is conducting a series of public meetings. However, the FAR Council has not
scheduled a public meeting on this rule (FAR case 94&hyph;720) because of the clarity and non-controversial nature
of the rule. If the public believes such a meeting is needed with respect to this rule, a letter requesting a public meeting
and outlining the nature of the requested meeting shall be submitted to and received by the FAR Secretariat (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 caption, above) on or before January 4, 1995. The FAR Council will consider such requests in determining whether a
public meeting on this rule should be scheduled.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The interim rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq., because nearly all contracts awarded to small
business are awarded on the basis of competition for a firm fixed price and submittal of cost or pricing data is not required.
An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments from small entities concerning
the affected FAR subpart will be considered in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610. Such comments must be submitted separately
and cite 5 U.S.C 601, et seq. (FAC 90&hyph;22, FAR case 94&hyph;720), in correspondence.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The paperwork burden estimate applicable to the requirements for certified cost or pricing data (9000&hyph;0013)
has been reduced to reflect the reduced numbers of submittals of certified cost or pricing data by civilian agency
contractors. The reduction in the estimated burden for cost or pricing data requirements stems from the reduced number
of submittals of cost or pricing data due to the increase in the threshold from $100,000 to $500,000. The paperwork
burden applicable to the Commercial Pricing Certification requirements (9000&hyph;0105) has been eliminated.
Inquiries should be directed to the FAR Secretariat, Room 4037, GS Building, Washington, DC 20405, (202) 501&hyph;4755
and cite FAC 90&hyph;22, OMB Clearance No. 9000&hyph;0013 or 9000&hyph;0105.

D. Determination to Issue an Interim Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A determination has been made under the authority of the Secretary of Defense (DOD), the Administrator of General
Services (GSA), and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) that compelling
reasons exist to promulgate this interim rule without prior opportunity for public comment. This action is necessary
because the portion of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 that increases the certified cost or pricing
data threshold for civilian agencies is effective upon enactment. Additionally, the Act repeals the requirements
for commercial pricing certifications and the unnecessary regulatory burden related to commercial pricing certificates
should be eliminated as quickly as possible to reduce administrative costs within the Government and at contractor
locations.

Price adjustment amounts shall consider both increases and decreases. (For example, a $150,000 modification resulting
from a reduction of $350,000 and an increase of $200,000 is a pricing adjustment exceeding $500,000.) This requirement

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On December 3, 1993, the Department published an interim rule which introduced a new mortgage insurance program authorized
by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992. The program is designed to increase the supply of affordable
multifamily units by allowing State and local housing finance agencies (HFAs) to originate and service mortgage
loans that are fully insured by HUD's Federal Housing Administration. Under the program, participating HFAs are
required to share in the risk associated with monetary losses that may be incurred as a consequence of any loan defaults.
Under the interim rule, 33 HFAs were approved to participate in the program. This rule finalizes the standards and
procedures of the interim rule after taking into account the concerns expressed, and the recommendations made, during
the rule's public comment period.

I. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 542(c) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-550, approved October 28, 1992) (1992
Act) as amended by the Multifamily Housing Property Disposition Reform Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103-233, approved April
11, 1994) (1994 Act) authorizes the HUD Secretary to enter into risk-sharing agreements with qualified State or local
Housing Finance Agencies (HFAs) to test the effectiveness of certain Federal mortgage loan credit enhancements.
(Section 542(c) is a part of subtitle C, title V of the 1992 Act. Section 541 provides that subtitle C, which consists
of sections 541 through 544, may be cited as the ``Multifamily Housing Finance Improvement Act.'' This rule implements
only section 542(c).) The purpose of section 542(c) is to increase the supply of affordable multifamily housing through
partnerships with housing finance agencies (HFAs) where the Department provides full insurance under a risk-sharing
agreement to test the effectiveness of providing new forms of Federal credit enhancement for multifamily loans,
an intended benefit of which would be increased credit ratings on bond-financed mortgage loans. HUD envisions that,
under this program, HFAs will have greater access to capital markets and be able to provide affordable housing in a
manner that is both timely and efficient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``partnership'' as used in the preceding paragraph and in section 542 is used in the generic sense and not in
the technical legal sense. It is not intended to impose any partnership liability on HUD in the event of negligence
or other actionable misconduct by an HFA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The basic structure of the program allows HFAs to carry out certain HUD functions under the program, including the
assumption of loan management and property disposition responsibilities for defaulted loans. In the event of a loan
default, the HFA is required to share with HUD in any loss arising as a consequence of the loan default. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 542(c) prescribes certain requirements for this program, and also authorizes the Secretary to issue such
regulations as may be necessary to carry out the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Legislative Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1992 Act contains definitions for what constitutes ``multifamily housing'' (section 544(1)), a ``qualified''
HFA (section 544(2)), and ``affordable housing'' (section 542(c)(7)). These definitions have been incorporated
into the regulation at 24 CFR 266.5. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, section 542(c) prescribes a number of requirements for the program, which may be summarized as follows:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 HUD is required to execute risk-sharing agreements with qualified HFAs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Mortgage insurance:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Risk-sharing agreements must provide for HUD to fully insure mortgage loans originated by or through HFAs, and for
reimbursement to HUD by HFAs for a portion of any losses incurred on the insured loans.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Risk apportionment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The percentage of loss assumed by HUD and the HFA (risk apportionment) must be specified in the risk-sharing agreement
between HUD and the HFA. HUD intends to execute a single agreement with each HFA, but the agreement will recognize that
the risk apportionment may vary among project loans that are originated by a single HFA. The loan loss percentage for
a particular project will be reflected in that project's underlying loan documentation and in an addendum to the risk-sharing
agreement.

Underwriting standards:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A qualified HFA that agrees to accept 50 percent or more of the risk of loss on a loan may employ its own underwriting standards,
loan terms and conditions. However, where HUD retains more than 50 percent of the risk, it may impose additional underwriting
standards, and loan terms and conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Other requirements:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 542(c) also requires HUD to establish a schedule for mortgage insurance premiums that reflects the risk apportionment
for the loan. Lower or nominal premiums will apply to HFAs that assume a greater share of the risk of loss. In addition,
HUD is prohibited from applying ``identity of interest'' provisions in risk-sharing agreements (section 542(c)(5));
and GNMA is prohibited from issuing securities for loans insured under the program (section 542(c)(6)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, HUD may issue commitments for mortgages that, in the aggregate, do not exceed 30,000 units between now and
September 30, 1995 (section 542(c)(4)). The Congress may expand the program after that date, but no determination
will be made until the Secretary has submitted reports (including any recommendations for legislation) to the Congress,
as required under section 542(d)(3). (

III. The Regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The legislation authorizing this program prescribes certain requirements in relation to eligibility and risk apportionment.
As a matter of policy, in its formulation of this regulation, HUD has decided to afford qualified HFAs very broad responsibility
for the administration of the program, although HUD will monitor HFAs' activities. In addition to underwriting and
processing loans, HFAs will service loans, provide management oversight of the projects, and dispose of properties
subject to mortgages that fall into default. The regulation provides for sanctions in the event that an HFA is found
to be in noncompliance with the requirements of the regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is to be noted that for this program the Congress, in section 542(c)(2)(E) of the 1992 Act, has assigned to qualified
HFAs the responsibility for using their own ``underwriting standards and loan terms and conditions for purposes
of loans to be insured under this subsection'' without further review by the Secretary, except that the Secretary
may impose ``additional underwriting criteria and loan terms and conditions'' in cases where the Secretary retains
more than 50 percent of the risk of loss. Further, Congress has authorized HUD through section 542(c)(8) to issue such
regulations as may be necessary to carry out this risk-sharing program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In cases involving ``insurance upon completion,'' HUD will be responsible for final endorsement of the mortgage
note for insurance. In cases involving ``insurance of advances,'' HUD will be responsible for the initial and final
endorsement of the mortgage note for insurance in a maximum amount set forth on the note. The amount of the insurance,
however, will be only to the extent of advances approved during the construction process. The Department has decided
to delegate to HFAs the responsibilities for the insurance of advances and cost certification functions. These functions
are relevant to the insurance process and are carried out by HUD in full insurance programs under the National Housing
Act.

<TEXT>
 
<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the functions proposed for delegation are integral to the insurance process, the Department has determined
that the delegation would be legally sustainable if HUD retains the authority to make adjustments to the insured mortgage
amount during the period up to and including the time of final endorsement, which it has done in &sect;266.417 of the
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD's reservation of final authority to adjust the insured mortgage amount is not meant to suggest that HUD will, as
a matter of policy, routinely review all decisions of HFAs about the insurance of advances and cost certification
processes. For example, the Commissioner could review the insurance of advances and cost certification processes
on a random basis and, up to and including the time of final endorsement, correct errors by adjusting the amount of mortgage
insurance. Examples of such reviews of the insurance of advances process could involve a HUD evaluation of an HFA's
approval of advances to determine whether such approval is consistent with construction progress. The Department
could assess whether other mortgageable items were supported with proper bills and/or receipts before funds were
approved. The Department also could consider whether the loan remains in balance by comparison of actual disbursements
against a project completion schedule and other loan closing documents. Unless additional requirements are imposed
by HUD because it insures more than 50 percent of the risk, the review at cost certification would only involve an assessment
that the maximum insurable mortgage amount is supported by costs incurred and approved for the project by the HFA.
By this reservation of authority to adjust the mortgage amount, HUD also is reducing any adverse effect from fees,
which are linked to mortgage amount, that the HFAs may earn in connection with the project loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notwithstanding the retention by HUD of ultimate authority to adjust the insured mortgage amount, the HFAs still
would be carrying out an important function in connection with the insurance of advances and cost certification processes.
The delegation of this function is consistent with Congress' view in section 542(a) of the 1992 Act that the relationship
between HUD and HFAs is to be a partnership and that major functions are to be the responsibilities of the HFAs as evidenced
by the direct assignment of underwriting functions in section 542(c)(2)(E). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulation will be contained in a new part 266 in title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations, which consists of six
subparts. A brief summary of each subpart follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart A_General Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart A sets forth the purpose and scope of the regulation. It cites the legislative background, and indicates HUD's
policy decision to vest broad responsibility for the conduct of the program in participating HFAs. Subpart A also
includes definitions of terms used throughout the regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 266.10, Allocations of Authority and Credit Subsidy, states that HUD will issue notices in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 inviting State and local HFAs to apply for participation in the program. Earlier provisions contained in the interim
rule relating to planned HUD allocations and state-wide caps on the amount of assistance are deleted in this final
rule. Those topics instead will be covered in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 266.15 describes key components that must be included in the risk-sharing agreement executed between HUD
and the HFA. Among other things, the risk-sharing agreement will reflect the agreed upon risk apportionment; the
number of units allocated to the HFA; description (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
incorporation by reference) of the HFA's standards and procedures for underwriting and servicing of loans; and a
list of required HFA certifications designed to assure its proper performance under the program. (The list of certifications
is not comprehensive and is subject to change as circumstances and experience dictate.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appraisals of all properties must be performed by Certified General Appraisers, licensed in the State in which the
property is located, and must be completed in accordance with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice.
In addition, 24 CFR part 267 (see final rule published October 3, 1994 at 59 FR 50456), establishes a reporting requirement
for the gender and minority classification for appraisers. Compliance with this reporting requirement will be included
in the risk sharing agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart A contains sections indicating that future regulatory amendments will not impair previously recognized
contract rights and that HUD has no obligation to recognize or deal with parties other than the HFA, in the latter's
role as mortgagee of record under a contract of mortgage insurance. Section 266.30 provides that the provisions of
24 CFR part 246 (Local Rent Control) do not apply to this program. The Department will not be utilizing its constitutional
authority to preempt local rent control laws for projects with mortgages insured under part 266. Representatives
of HFAs have advised the Department that many HFAs, both State and local, already have such authority and, therefore,
the absence of access to the Federal preemption authority would in no way restrict or interfere with the manner in which
HFAs currently operate. Since the program involves risk to both HFAs and the Federal government, the Federal interest
will be adequately protected by HFAs who use their preemption authority to protect their own interests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim rule also contains a general waiver provision in &sect;266.35. Under that section, the Commissioner
may, upon a finding of good cause, waive any provision in part 266 that is not a statutory requirement, except that the
Commissioner will not consider waivers of financial requirements for participating HFAs or underwriting standards
required by HUD for Level II participants. All waivers granted under &sect;266.35 will be in writing and will be published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, as required by section 7(q) of the Department of Housing and Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3535(q)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart B_Agency Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart B describes the criteria HFAs must meet to qualify under the program. It became evident during HUD's review
of the applications for participation in the pilot program that there was some confusion as to the interpretation
of the term in section 544(2)(B) which defines a qualified housing agency as one that ``receives a rating of `A' for
its general obligation bonds.'' Some agencies interpreted this to mean that an ``A'' rating on bonds financing a particular
project met the definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interpretation would be inconsistent with sections 544(2)(A) and (2)(C), which require evidence of a strong
financial capacity on the part of the agency. Such a construction would permit an HFA with one strong bond issue and
several other issuances with ratings below ``A'' to claim that they met the qualified agency criteria. The Department
does not construe this to be in accordance with the intent of Congress. In this final rule, HUD interprets the phrase
``general obligation bonds'' to mean the rating on bonds issued by the HFA based on the strength of the general obligation
of the agency itself. Like the ``top-tier'' rating, a rating of ``A'' on general obligation bonds is provided by nationally
recognized rating agencies only after thorough review and analysis of an agency's financial, administrative and
operational capacity. This rating based on the strength of an agency's general obligation pertains to issuance of
bonds and other debt instruments that are backed by income/resources from unencumbered fund balances rather than
by cash flow from a particular project or projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two levels of approval_Level I and Level II_are described in &sect;266.100. The primary distinction between the
two levels is in the level of risk apportionment an HFA agrees to undertake. HFAs participating at Level I are those
that will assume 50 percent or more of the risk associated with a loan default. Level II participants will assume 10
or 25 percent of the risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulation requires any applicant HFA (whether it selects either Level I or Level II, or both Level I and Level II
approval) to meet eligibility standards and application requirements. Eligibility is predicated on an HFA's demonstrable
high financial capacity and/or experience and capability in the field of multifamily housing. Application requirements
are designed to elicit the HFA's (legal and other) capacity to function in the program.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart B also sets forth minimum reserve requirements that must be met by participating HFAs (&sect;266.110). An
HFA is required to maintain its basic sound financial capacity at all times. An HFA that qualifies for the program under
the criteria in section 544(2) (A) or (B) of the 1992 Act (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, is designated ``top-tier, or the equivalent thereof'' or receives an overall rating of ``A'' on its general obligation
bonds from a nationally recognized rating agency) will not be required to maintain additional reserves unless determined
necessary by the Commissioner. ``Other agencies,'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, those that qualify based on other criteria, will be required to establish minimum reserve requirements that are
set forth in &sect;266.110(b). Any HFA that initially qualifies under, but later loses, the ``top-tier or equivalent''
designation or an overall rating of ``A'' on its general obligation bonds will be required to immediately establish
and maintain the reserve amounts required for ``other agencies'' by &sect;266.110(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule clarifies two requirements set forth in the interim rule. First, it makes clear (&sect;266.105(b)(1))
that there must be documentation satisfactory to the Commissioner that the HFA meets the qualification requirements
of &sect;266.100(a). This documentation must be submitted as a part of its application. Second, it provides that
any dedicated account required under &sect;266.110(b) must be established prior to execution of any Risk Sharing
Agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 266.115&hyph;266.125 describe the monitoring and evaluation activities and requirements of the program,
the kinds of HFA conduct that could give rise to sanctions by the Department, and the nature of sanctions that HUD may
impose. The rule provides HFAs the right to an informal hearing where sanctions have been applied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this final rule, the language of &sect;266.15(b)(5) relating to the availability of HFA financial and other records
for HUD inspection is revised to reflect the statutory phrasing enacted as section 307(b)(2) of the 1994 Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, &sect;266.130 provides that HFAs may obtain reinsurance for their portion of the risk and describes the
conditions under which reinsurance will be permitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart C_Program Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart C contains program requirements such as project eligibility and fair housing and equal opportunity requirements.
It also describes review functions to be retained by HUD as well as those delegated to HFAs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Project size and affordability requirements in the rule follow the authorizing legislation. Subject to requirements
in the regulation, mortgage insurance will be available under this program for project new construction and substantial
rehabilitation, and for existing projects without substantial rehabilitation. Similarly, projects receiving
section 8 or other rental subsidies are eligible for insurance under the program, subject to limitations on the rent
levels. These limits are designed to ensure that project rents are clearly adequate to support the mortgage. Other
eligible projects include single room occupancy (SRO) projects, board and care and assisted living facilities,
and projects designed for persons 62 years of age or more. In response to providers of affordable housing, mobile home
parks (exclusive of the mobile homes) have been added as an eligible housing type. This will permit HFAs to provide
this important type of affordable housing through the Risk-Sharing Program. Transient housing, hotels, nursing
homes and intermediate care facilities, and projects located in military impact areas are ineligible for insurance
under this program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule makes clear that, for purposes of this pilot program, cooperative properties are considered rental
housing, just as they are under the National Housing Act (see &sect;266.200(a)). While section 542(c)(7) refers
to rents, and section 544 defines multifamily housing as covering not less than five (5) ``rental'' units on one (1)
site, cooperative carrying charges are similar to rents and HUD does not believe that Congress intended to preclude
the insurance of mortgages for cooperatives under the program.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD will retain responsibility for assessing the ``previous participation'' of mortgagors, contractors, consultants
or management agents in HUD programs and for intergovernmental and environmental review. HUD will delegate to HFAs
the functions pertaining to a project's affirmative fair housing marketing plan and certain activities under the
Davis-Bacon Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to HUD environmental reviews, it should be noted that section 307(b)(4) of the 1994 Act authorizes the
Secretary of HUD, under such regulation in lieu of the environmental protection procedures otherwise applicable,
to provide for agreements to endorse for insurance mortgages under this pilot program upon the request of qualified
HFAs if the State or unit of general local government, as designated by the Secretary, assumes all of the responsibilities
for environmental review, decision making, and action pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969
and other relevant laws. The statute goes into further detail as to what specific provisions will be contained in any
regulations the Secretary may issue. The Department has in process draft regulations to implement this section 307(b)(4)
of the '94 Act, which will be promulgated in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as a separate rule, which will amend both this final rule and 24 CFR part 58_Environmental Review Procedures for the
Community Development Block Grant, Rental Rehabilitation, and Housing Development Grant Programs. Until such
time as this new rule takes effect, the Department will retain responsibility for assuring compliance with the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and related laws. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 542(c) of the Act does not statutorily require payment of prevailing wage rates determined by the Secretary
of Labor under the Davis-Bacon Act on projects receiving mortgage insurance under the pilot program. However, the
Department has administratively determined that it will require payment of Davis-Bacon wage rates on certain projects
receiving mortgage insurance under the program. As provided in &sect;266.225 of the rule, Davis-Bacon wage rates
will be required to be paid to all laborers and mechanics (except volunteers) employed by contractors and subcontractors
on projects (1) for which advances are insured under this part; (2) which involve new construction or substantial
rehabilitation; and (3) which will contain 12 or more dwelling units. Davis-Bacon requirements will apply only if
all of these conditions are met, unless Davis-Bacon wage rates are applicable by reason of assistance from another
Federal program. (For example, if assistance under Section 8 is also used in connection with a project under this part
that involves minor rehabilitation, Davis-Bacon requirements would apply to the project if it contains nine or more
Section 8-assisted units.) The Department has decided to require payment of Davis-Bacon wage rates to ensure that
prevailing wage requirements under this program are generally comparable to similar provisions required by statute
for multifamily mortgage insurance programs under the National Housing Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule also states that while the Commissioner retains responsibility for enforcement of labor standards under
this section, the Commissioner may delegate to the HFA information collection (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
payroll review and routine interviews) and other routine administration and enforcement functions, subject to
monitoring by the Commissioner. The Department intends to delegate such routine administration and enforcement
functions to HFAs. This delegation is consistent with the Department's decision to delegate many of the functions
relating to insurance of individual projects to the HFAs. The delegation is also consistent with the Department's
longstanding delegation of routine Davis-Bacon functions to States and local governments under the Community Development
Block Grant program.

Subpart D_Processing, Development, and Approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart D describes functions that the HFA and HUD will undertake in relation to a loan origination and HUD insurance
endorsement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An HFA that assumes 50 percent or more of the risk associated with a loan may use its own underwriting standards and loan
terms and conditions to underwrite and approve loans. Where an HFA assumes less than 50 percent of the risk, underwriting
standards and loan terms and conditions are subject to HUD review, modification and approval. The rule provisions
also cover responsibilities of HFAs concerning such matters as project feasibility, acceptability of the mortgagor,
and inspections during the project construction period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 266.310 provides the circumstances where HUD will insure loan advances, or agree to insure the entire mortgage
upon completion of construction. Where a mortgage is endorsed for insurance, the interim rule provides that the HFA
must remain the mortgagee of record for as long as mortgage insurance is in force. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart E_Mortgage and Closing Requirements; HUD Endorsement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart E contains requirements that relate to the mortgage and the property that secures the insured loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department recognizes that section 542(c)(2)(E) provides that HFAs are permitted to use their own underwriting
standards and loan terms and conditions for purposes of underwriting loans to be insured under this program where
the HFA is assuming 50 percent or more of the risk of loss. Where the Secretary retains more than 50 percent of the risk
of loss, section 542(c)(2)(E) permits the Secretary to impose additional underwriting criteria and loan terms and
conditions on loans to be insured under the program. However, it is the Department's view that Congress intended,
in enacting section 542(c), to develop a fiscally prudent mortgage insurance program. The interim rule cited several
examples of HUD regulations being imposed by the Department, including the requirement that the HUD-insured mortgage
constitute a first lien. Subsequent to publication of the interim rule, Congress expressly amended the Act to establish
as a program requirement that the insured mortgage be a first lien. However, the Department believes that Congress
did not intend to preclude other HUD regulations that would provide: (1) that the HUD-insured mortgage be regularly
amortizing; (2) that the insured mortgage contain a covenant against the change in use of the insured property; (3)
that the insured mortgage contain a covenant requiring the mortgagor to keep the property, which is security for the
mortgage, insured against loss due to fire or other hazards; and (4) that the regulatory agreement executed by the
mortgagor contain a provision requiring that the mortgagor be a sole asset mortgagor.

Amortization. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department does not believe that Congress, in its enactment of section 542(c), intended to permit the use of riskier
financing practices such as balloon payment terms and negative amortization. Use of these types of financing practices
in insured programs could increase the chances that an insured mortgage would go into default or otherwise increase
the Department's exposure on a mortgage where the terms of the financing permitted negative amortization. It is the
Department's view that requiring a mortgage to be regularly amortizing would curtail the use of riskier financing
practices that could jeopardize the stability of the insured loan.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Change in use. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department's purpose in requiring that a mortgage insured under this program contain a covenant prohibiting
a change in use of the insured property was to carry out the intent of Congress that the mortgage insurance be used to
provide affordable residential housing, rather than for some commercial enterprise, such as a hotel or office building.
It has been HUD's view in all of its insurance programs, and it is HUD's view in this rule, that such a provision is not
intended to preclude the conversion of a project from rental to cooperative housing since both rental and cooperative
housing are residential housing. The ``change in use'' provision is intended to preclude the conversion of a project
from residential use to some other form of use, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

, commercial use.

Hazard insurance. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department does not believe that Congress, in enacting the section 542(c) risk-sharing program, intended for
the Secretary to insure a mortgage on a project that is not insured against damage or destruction due to fire or other
hazards. Additionally, the Department cannot conceive of an HFA making a loan on a project that is not insured against
loss due to hazards. The requirement that a mortgagor under a mortgage have hazard insurance is a standard mortgage
industry practice. Additionally, it is the Department's position that hazard insurance is a fundamental requirement
of Federal mortgage insurance to protect the public fisc against loss of public assets and, therefore, must be required
in this program.

Single asset mortgagor. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The requirement that a mortgagor be a single asset mortgagor is a requirement that is critical to the Department's
ability to prevent the mortgagor of an insured project from commingling funds of the insured project with other assets
that a mortgagor entity might own, if permitted. If the Department were to allow a mortgagor entity to own assets other
than the insured project, this would increase the chances of a mortgagor siphoning off funds from an insured project
for use in a conventionally financed project. This could result in the mortgagor of the insured mortgage suffering
severe financial difficulty, possibly defaulting on the insured mortgage and a subsequent insurance claim being
filed by the HFA. In addition, the assets of an insured project could become at risk, as a result of their application
to the debts of a conventionally financed project in financial difficulty where both projects have the same owner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other provisions in subpart E pertain to the closing of a mortgage loan. The closing will be held by the HFA, which is
then required to submit a closing docket (with required documentation) to HUD for insurance endorsement. The required
documentation is set forth in the interim rule as well.

The HFA will have broad responsibility for the administration of this program, including monitoring and determining
the compliance of the project owner with the requirements of this rule. HUD will not hold or be a party to any mortgage
or note instruments between the mortgagor and the HFA. HUD will, however, monitor the performance of the HFA to determine
its compliance with this subpart.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 266.505 lists certain requirements that must be included in the regulatory agreement that is executed by
the HFA and the project owner. Those requirements are necessary to assure that the owner will maintain the sound financial
and physical condition of the project, and maintain the project as an affordable housing resource. Section 266.510
describes the responsibilities of the HFA for annual project inspections, review of an owner's compliance with the
affirmative fair housing marketing plan, and analysis of the owner's annual audit and recordkeeping.

Subpart G_Contract Rights and Obligations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart G contains provisions with regard to the mortgage insurance premium (MIP) in &sect;&sect;266.600&hyph;266.608.
In accordance with section 542(c)(3), the rule provides for a ``sliding scale'' of MIP payments, with reduced amounts
payable in inverse proportion to the increase in an HFA's risk apportionment. Risk apportionment percentages range
from 10 to 90 percent. At the high end, an HFA assuming 90 percent of the risk would be required to pay a .05 percent MIP
based upon the average outstanding principal balance (without taking into account delinquent payments or prepayments)
per annum. At the other end of the spectrum, an HFA assuming 10 percent of the risk would be required to pay a .45 percent
MIP based upon the average outstanding principal balance per annum.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart G also contains provisions on insurance endorsement and assignments. Endorsement of the original credit
instrument will indicate the Commissioner's insurance of the mortgage. Section 542(c)(2)(B) of the 1992 Act provides
for full mortgage insurance for loans originated by or through qualified HFAs. While this provision clearly permits
qualified HFAs to underwrite loans for other HFAs or mortgage entities or to sell their loans in the secondary market,
the Department discussed this option with HFA representatives with particular concern about how the HFA would maintain
its risk-sharing obligation in such transactions. In view of the complexities of implementing this aspect of the
statute and the desire to implement the pilot program in a timely manner, it was agreed between the HFAs and HUD that
entities other than approved HFAs would not be permitted to be mortgagees originating loans to be insured under this
program. The one exception was with respect to the transfer of partial interest under a participation agreement.
Section 266.616 permits the transfer of up to 100 percent of the beneficial interest in a loan or a pool of loans insured
under part 266, provided that, among other things, the HFA remains the mortgagee of record and is the party with whom
the Commissioner deals under the contract of mortgage insurance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 266.620 describes the circumstances under which the contract of insurance will terminate. These are (1)
payment in full of the mortgage; (2) acquisition of the mortgaged property by the HFA and notification to the Commissioner
that no claim for insurance benefits will be made; (3) acquisition of the property at a foreclosure sale by a party other
than the HFA; (4) notification by the HFA to the Commissioner of voluntary termination; (5) a finding of fraud or material
misrepresentation on the part of the HFA or its successors with respect to the contract of insurance; or (6) receipt
by the Commissioner of an application for final claims settlement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The latter part of subpart G describes the procedures for filing a claim upon a default, determining the amount of the
claim, and payment of the claim. Section 266.630 describes the requirements for filing for a partial payment of a claim.
This section is intended to avoid full insurance claim payments by providing the HFA with flexibility to deal with
a nonperforming mortgage where the default is due to circumstances beyond the mortgagor's control and the financial
relief provided by the HFA is sufficient to restore the financial viability of the project. When the conditions of
this section are met, an HFA may reduce the unpaid principal balance of the insured mortgage by up to 50 percent and may
defer delinquent interest. The HFA must secure the mortgagor's repayment of this relief with a second mortgage, which
can have deferred amortization thereby allowing the mortgagor to repay the second mortgage in increasingly larger
amounts as the project's cash flow improves.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this partial claim procedure, upon the HFA providing the above-described relief, HUD makes a partial claim
payment to the HFA in an amount that is a percentage of the relief provided by the HFA to the mortgagor. The percentage
is equal to HUD's percentage of the risk of loss on the original mortgage loan or 50 percent, whichever is less. The HFA,
in turn, must remit to HUD the same percentage of all amounts that it collects on its second mortgage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When HUD pays a claim (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., entire amount, in cash), &sect;266.638 provides that the HFA will issue a debenture (or a promissory note, a bond,
or any other instrument, hereinafter referred to as ``debenture'') to HUD for the full amount of the claim. The debenture
will have a term of five years in order to afford the HFA ample time to work with the mortgagor to cure the default or foreclose
and/or resell the project. During the five year period, the HFA will pay HUD interest on the debenture, due and payable
on the anniversary of the claim payment. At the end of five years, or at the point of settlement when the debenture is
paid, HUD will determine the amount of losses to be apportioned between HUD and the HFA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 266.640 through 266.656 concern the final disposition of a claim, including the HFA's ability to accept
a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure; the use of an appraisal to determine property value in the absence of a foreclosure
sale; the manner in which the amount of a loss is determined; and final settlement.

. Commenter 7 pointed out that the rule states that HUD will allocate unused insuring authority at the beginning of
FY 1995, and the draft handbook indicates that HUD may increase or decrease these allocations at the end of FY 1994 depending
upon the number of units that have received initial endorsement. The commenter recommended that since HFAs will only
have six months to process applications in FY 1994, HUD reduce a participating HFA's allocations only if the HFA agrees
that it will be unable to use all its insurance authority by the end of FY 1995. Commenter 1 was also concerned about the
short time left in FY 1994 after the application process, and asked whether an HFA would risk the possibility of losing
units that are in the application process but which have not reached initial endorsement. That commenter believed
that the September 30, 1994 deadline for achieving initial endorsement seemed very unrealistic.

Commenter 9 referred to the limit of 30,000 units that may be insured under the pilot program through Fiscal Year 1995,
stating that it does not believe the program will produce a high level of production. Citing the complicated, staff-intensive,
and time-consuming transactions involved in underwriting loans of this type, the commenter is of the opinion that
risk-sharing with HFAs can only serve as a modest supplement to existing FHA programs. The commenter recommended
that HUD improve the delivery of multifamily mortgage insurance under its regular insurance programs as well as under
special programs and initiatives such as this one. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenter 11 expressed somewhat similar views and urged improvement and augmentation of HUD's multifamily housing
staff capabilities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Because the publication of the interim rule and approval of qualified HFAs occurred later than anticipated, the
interim rule and draft administrative handbook do not reflect the correct schedule for reallocation of units for
the Pilot program. Unit set-asides and allocations were made in March 1994. Unit allocations may not be used by an HFA
until a Risk-Sharing Agreement (RSA) is executed. The time required for HFAs to sign RSAs and return them to HUD has
been longer than expected. It is likely that some HFAs may not even have an executed RSA until some time in FY 1995. Therefore,
rather than reallocating units at the end of FY 1994, HUD will wait until January 1995 to assess usage and reallocate
if necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the meantime, the Department will use a portion of the 10,000 unit holdback on a ``first come, first served'' basis
for increases to HFA set-asides that have been exhausted. In addition, units will be considered used at an earlier
stage_when the Firm Approval Letter is issued_not at initial endorsement. Credit subsidy for a project will also
be obligated by the firm approval stage which is a change from the language in the interim rule. Credit subsidy will
be obligated and allocated in accordance with outstanding Department instructions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the comment regarding use of the units, the Department anticipates that the 30,000 units allocated
to the program will be used for the demonstration. The delivery of multifamily mortgage insurance under HUD's regular
programs is not the subject of this interim rule. The Risk-Sharing program is a partnership with State and local HFAs
to increase the supply of affordable housing; it is not meant to be a substitute for other HUD insurance programs. However,
the Department does anticipate that the pilot will become a model for augmenting mortgage insurance capability.
In any event, the Department will carefully study the results of the pilot period and expand the program accordingly.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this regard, although not in response to public comment, we note that it is likely that the program will be expanded,
perhaps by another 30,000 units for use beyond the end of FY 1995. The regulation and the above comments do not currently
assume this extension. Should this occur during the regulation process, further consideration about reopening
the window for application submission and methods for reallocation of units will be required.

. Commenter 12 suggested that the requirement in &sect;266.15(b) (5)(viii) for a certification from the HFA that
it has errors and omissions insurance should be changed or eliminated to reflect situations where HFA employees are
covered by a fidelity bond that covers all state employees. The same commenter stated that the requirement in &sect;266.15(b)(8)
for the highest level of appraiser certification is not necessary. The commenter does not employ the use of appraisals
for the purpose of establishing completed project value or mortgage amount, but rather to determine the maximum amount
of land value (or an existing building's value in the case of rehab) to be recognized in the mortgage calculation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The program does require that HFAs have errors and omissions insurance and this is reflected in the Risk-Sharing Agreement.
If there is an impediment that precludes the HFA from obtaining this insurance, the Department will consider waivers
for good cause and with adequate protection under some other means. This provision has, in fact, been waived for two
HFAs that were either covered under State provisions or where the State was self-insured. In these cases, this provision
of the RSA was modified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the comment about use of certified appraisers, the Risk-Sharing program regulation does require
compliance with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP). USPAP requires use of a Certified
General Appraiser for work done under either Standard 1, for determining value, or Standard 4, real estate consultations.
This latter Standard covers multifamily cases where value is not determined using the standard three approaches
to value but the appraiser does a rental and expense analysis and calculates a capitalized value, similar to what HUD
does in the Section 221(d)(4) program.

 Commenter 9 expressed a concern that the number of HFAs qualified to originate, underwrite, service and manage multifamily
loans is severely limited. The commenter did not question the importance or relevance of the rule's criteria for an
HFA to have a certain level of internal staff capacity to review and evaluate work of any contractors it may hire to perform
technical services, to make underwriting conclusions, and to oversee its loan portfolio, and that an HFA have an established
record in multifamily loan processing, servicing and property disposition, but believes the ability of most HFAs
to hire experienced personnel or train existing staff is limited because of local and state budget constraints. The
commenter believes that this limited ability to participate will leave many parts of the country with no representation
or service.

 Commenter 5 questioned the requirement in &sect;266.105(b)(12) for an unaudited interim financial statement if
the latest audit statement of an HFA is more than six months old. The commenter stated that the requirement should be
more specific about the information to be provided, the time period to be covered, and the standard of accounting to
be used. The same commenter stated that the information requested in the additional application requirements for
HFAs without top-tier designation or overall rating of ``A'' (paragraph (c)) could be derived from an HFA's comprehensive
annual financial report that also includes its audited financial statements. The commenter suggested that the information
be provided only if unavailable in other documents submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenter 12 stated that the ``highest quality compliance plan'' requirement in &sect;266.105(b)(4) is redundant,

if the latest HFA audit is more than 6 months old is not only unclear but is unnecessary. This requirement has been removed
from the text of this final rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
However, the requirement for submission of the Questionnaire outlined in the Notice of Invitation and referred to
in &sect;266.105(c) is critical to HUD's capacity to review applications. HFAs with a ``top-tier'' designation
or ``A'' rating on their general obligation bonds from a national rating agency are subject to an intensive in-depth
review of their operations, financial status, administrative capability and a host of other components comprising
the other items on the Questionnaire by the rating agencies. Absent that review, HUD must make the same kind of analysis
based on the Questionnaire, which is in a clear, concise and focused form. It also affords the HFA the opportunity to
present their operations and capacity in a concise and positive way to the Department during the review process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The quality control plan supplements the other descriptive material submitted relative to underwriting standards
and procedures, staff capacity, etc., by indicating the checks and balances within the HFA to ensure compliance with
procedures and requirements whether performed by in-house staff or, more particularly, by contract personnel.

 Commenter 9 expressed a concern about the program allowing Level I participants to use their own underwriting criteria,
fearing that it will make monitoring and reviewing by HUD more difficult. The commenter used the example of HUD's failure
to adequately monitor coinsuring lenders who used HUD-established underwriting criteria and to impose sanctions
when necessary. The commenter recommended that HUD reconsider its ability to monitor before delegating so much authority
to third parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenter 12 suggested that the &sect;266.115 requirement for semiannual reports is burdensome, and should be changed
to annual reports. The commenter also believes that these reports should only contain information indicating a problem
or workout. The commenter also suggested that annual physical inspection and audit reports be sent to HUD only in cases
where the HFA determines there is a likelihood of a claim.

 With respect to Level I participants using their own underwriting criteria, the statute specifies that HFAs taking
50 percent or more of the risk (i.e., Level I participants) may use their own underwriting standards and loan terms
and conditions. As to the comment on semiannual reports, the Department feels it is imperative that we be able to assess
the progress and identify any impending problems through this reporting system. The data requested will also help
HUD track other matters, such as MIP. Coupled with annual physical inspection reports and project audit reports,
this data will aid HUD in meeting its oversight and monitoring responsibility to make its own informed decision as
to whether there is a likelihood of a claim.

 Commenter 12 pointed out that &sect;266.120(e)(13) should be changed to make clear that Level I lenders cannot potentially
be penalized for following their own underwriting standards. The commenter also recommended eliminating the provision
in &sect;266.125(a)(4) that allows HUD to terminate insurance in cases of fraud or material misrepresentation by
the HFA. The commenter fears that the provision will be unacceptable to bond holders or secondary mortgage market
investors who will not be able to rely on the insurance. According to the commenter, the government's interests are
adequately protected under &sect;266.125(a)(2) by the HFA being required to assume a higher risk level.

HUD Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Level I HFAs may use their own underwriting standards but must, nevertheless, also act prudently in accordance with
generally accepted practices. This provision is not intended to penalize participants for plausible judgments
about underwriting considerations but, rather, to prohibit the wide-scale abuse that occurred under the coinsurance
program. We also note that the provision in &sect;266.125(a)(4) that allows HUD to terminate insurance in cases of
fraud or material misrepresentation by the HFA is the same as for HUD-processed insurance programs under the National
Housing Act. Projects insured under the National Housing Act are often bond-financed or sold on the secondary market,
so this provision should not be unacceptable to bond holders or secondary markets. Moreover, two of the major rating
agencies have thoroughly reviewed this program and have determined this provision, among others, to be satisfactory.
They anticipate that they will be rating such loans with bond financing as AAA.

Comments. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Transaction costs. Three commenters (1, 2, 7) objected to the requirement that HUD determine whether the transaction
costs for existing projects to be acquired are reasonable. The commenters believe this is inconsistent with the statute
that allows HFAs to use their own underwriting standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 8 projects. Commenter 7 also objected to the provision that Section 8 projects may be insured under the program
only if the mortgage does not exceed an amount supportable by the lower of the unit rents being collected under the rental
assistance agreement or market rents in similar projects. The commenter stated that HUD should allow HFAs to insure
Section 8 project mortgages without restriction, because it is common for Section 8 rents to exceed market rents,
and the restriction unnecessarily and unreasonably limits the use of the program to support financing those projects.
Further, the commenter stated that HUD does not provide incentives to reduce the cost of Section 8 projects through
refinancing, and believes HFAs should be allowed to retain savings from refinancing those projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Board and care/assisted living facilities. Two comments (10, 12) were directed to the restrictions on services that
can be provided by board and care/assisted living facilities. Both commenters recommended clarification with regard
to the ineligibility of retirement service centers, stating that central kitchens and dining rooms are not necessarily
``luxury accommodations,'' especially where residents are not required to use them. Commenter 10 stated that a strict
interpretation of the provision would effectively forbid financing of board and care or assisted living facilities
despite its explicit intention of doing so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenter 10 also included a lengthy discussion of the need for special regulations and underwriting standards to
govern the financing of assisted living facilities under the risk-sharing demonstration. The commenter pointed
out that HUD's own findings when it issued new underwriting standards for the Retirement Service Center (RSC) program
just before suspension of the program strongly argue for different underwriting standards for such projects. The
commenter argues that the program did not fail because too many services were offered, but rather because the Department
underestimated the care needs of the residents and did not adequately examine the financing of necessary services.
According to the commenter, the HFA Risk-Sharing program ignores the fundamental lesson of the RSC program that supportive
services are essential to a project's success. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Military impact area. Commenters 3 and 4 objected to the definition of ``military impact area,'' stating that it is
too broad. First, they argue that the designation of such an area as one in which military-connected households comprise
20 percent or more of the total households in the market area would exclude areas with stable military populations
at installations with a certain future. Further, they state that the definition of a ``military-connected household''
is too broad and the data to ascertain such households are unavailable. Secondly, the commenters object to the total
reduction in military households test, stating that it does not apply to many areas in the country where a ``total''
reduction is not a meaningful possibility.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Transaction costs and Section 8 projects. It was not the original intent of the Department to include either existing
projects or Section 8 (or other rental assistance) projects in the Risk-Sharing program. The legislation and legislative
history emphasize the expansion of affordable housing opportunities through the program. However, discussions
with the industry convinced us that there were certain limited circumstances where the Risk-Sharing program might
be warranted for such projects. The compromise reached as a result of these consultations was: (1) the limitation
on transaction costs for existing projects, and (2) the requirements relative to establishing the processing rents
to be used in determining the maximum insurable mortgage for Section 8 projects that would ensure that project rents
are clearly adequate to support the insured mortgage even when the rental assistance contract is shorter than the
mortgage term. (This provision is similar to procedures for processing of Section 8 projects by HUD Field Offices.)
To permit insurance of Section 8 projects without restriction would either create risk or put the Department in the
position of ensuring the continued funding of the Section 8 Contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Board and care/assisted living facilities. The definition of board and care/assisted living facilities stands
on its own. Projects meeting the definition are eligible. These facilities are residential health care facilities
regulated by State or local government. The Department knows of no States that do not require food service in such facilities.
The definition of board and care/assisted living does not conflict with that of retirement service centers. Retirement
service centers are unassisted rental projects, not residential health care facilities such as board and care and
assisted living, that include luxurious accommodations (such as large living units, and amenities such as tennis
courts etc.), mandatory services, and central kitchens and dining rooms. While it is unlikely that such projects
could be developed within the affordability parameters of the Risk-Sharing program, the Department wants to exclude
any possibility of insuring this kind of rental project which has been so unsuccessful under the regular insurance
programs. A discussion of why this kind of project was unsuccessful is not a subject of this preamble.

Military impact area. This definition of military impact area is the general definition the Department has been using
for some time. Although few areas have been designated as military impact areas, the ones that have been so designated
have been isolated markets with little housing market other than the military base. However, based on the comments,
we have revised the interim rule language to clarify and expand the definition of military impact areas. The administrative
instructions will also discuss procedures for making of military impact determinations based on these regulatory
standards.

Commenters 3 and 9 expressed concerns about the review functions retained by HUD. The commenters believe that the
``dual processing'' will result in processing delays, stating that this may limit the program's effectiveness.
Both commenters commended the Department's efforts to seek statutory changes in the legislation that would eliminate

The major HUD-retained review is the environmental review. At the time of the interim rule, HUD was not authorized
to delegate this review. The Multifamily Housing Property Disposition Reform Act of 1994 has now provided authority
to delegate this review. The Department currently is developing a rule to implement this new delegation authority.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two comments (1, 7) addressed the rule's requirement that cost certification functions be performed subject to terms
specified by the Commissioner, and a provision in the draft handbook that the cost certification be in a form acceptable
to the HFA. The commenters recommended that these two provisions, which seem to be conflicting, be clarified. The
commenters believe that, under the statute authorizing the program, HFAs are to use their own underwriting standards.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulation and handbook procedures which relate to cost certification referenced by the commenter are not in
conflict with one another. Each provision relates to a different stage of the cost certification process. The handbook
provision sets forth what procedures that a mortgagor of a mortgage insured under section 542(c) must follow when
submitting cost certification to the HFA. Section 266.215 sets forth what standards (those established by the Commissioner)
the HFA must follow in developing cost certification procedures to impose on mortgagors of projects to be insured
pursuant to section 542(c). HUD standards require that HFAs establish cost certification procedures which take
into consideration the underwriting procedures utilized by the HFA to process the loan. These cost certification
procedures are designed to ensure that the actual costs approved were in fact incurred by the mortgagor and that such
costs bear a direct relationship to the underwriting utilized in processing the loan.

Three commenters (1, 6, and 7) objected to the requirement that HFAs monitor the administration of the Davis-Bacon
Act. Commenter 6 stated that compliance monitoring should not be delegated to entities without authority or compensation
for its enforcement. Commenter 1 objected to the provision that HFAs bear financial responsibility for violations,
stating that compliance with Davis-Bacon is the responsibility of the owner and contractor. Commenter 7 agreed,
stating that no financial liability should be placed on HFAs except for gross negligence in fulfilling reasonable
responsibilities to notify applicants of the applicability of Davis-Bacon.

The Risk-Sharing program delegates to HFAs, to the maximum extent possible, the responsibilities for processing,
underwriting, servicing and other aspects of program operation of projects. The ministerial functions of labor
standards requirements comprise one of those delegated tasks. While HUD retains the enforcement function for labor
standards, HFAs are delegated the payroll review and routine interviews generally carried out as part of the construction
inspection function. This is consistent with the Department's long-standing delegation of routine Davis-Bacon
functions to States and localities under the Community Development Block Grant program. The financial liability
provision is the same as other delegations of labor standards functions.

The regulation does not define ``completion of construction'' since the exact definition will likely vary among
the procedures of the 33 approved program participants. Because the Department wishes to allow HFAs to use their own
procedures to the maximum extent possible, we do not think that a specific definition is necessary or desirable. This
issue will be addressed further in the administrative instructions.

Commenter 12 recommended deleting the requirement that marketable title to the mortgaged property be vested in the

Commenter 3 objected to the requirement that the mortgage provide for full amortization of the loan over the term of
the mortgage. The commenter stated that an HFA should be allowed to set the amortization period and term of the mortgage
in order to have full access to capital resources. Commenter 12 suggested that use restrictions (paragraph (f)) should
also be included in the regulatory agreement. The same commenter stated that the provision in paragraph (h) regarding
modification of terms of the mortgage must result in a reduction of Section 8 rents should be deleted. The commenter
stated that the Section 8 statute, regulations, and contract rights should determine HUD's rights to adjust rents,
and that this provision could prove harmful where a project is in trouble financially and refinancing at a lower rate
could provide the means to address the problem without causing a claim on the insurance fund.

Fully amortizing loan. While the Department wishes to permit HFAs participating in the program to use their own standards
and requirements as much as possible, we nevertheless are obliged to develop a fiscally prudent program. Mortgages
that are not fully amortizing have an inherent risk that the Department does not wish to incur, particularly in a pilot
program that will test so many aspects of this new partnership. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Use restriction. The commenter suggests that the use restriction in the insured mortgage prohibiting the use of the
property for any purpose other than that intended on the day the mortgage is executed also be included in the regulatory
agreement between the HFA and the mortgagor. Section 266.505(b)(4) on the requirements of the regulatory agreement
already contains this provision.

The commenter's point is unclear. Paragraph (a) on liens and paragraph (b) on contractual obligations permit inferior
liens and obligations that are acceptable to the HFA as long as the HUD mortgage is first in line for payment. If the commenter
is referring to mechanics' and similar liens, HUD permits such liens in its own projects where the title company is
willing to insure over such liens. There is nothing to preclude HFAs from using this procedure if it is acceptable to
them.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three commenters (1, 7, and 12) raised questions about HUD retaining the authority to adjust the insured mortgage
amount at any time up to final endorsement. The commenters are concerned that this will undermine the underwriting
authority of HFAs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The authority to adjust the mortgage amount is discussed at length in the preambles to both this rule and the interim
rule. It is required because neither the current statutory language in section 542(c) nor the legislative history
contains a delegation to HFAs for insurance of advances and cost certification, among other things. In developing
the interim rule, the Department examined the legal propriety of such delegations because of the desire to make these
delegations to HFAs for maximum program efficiency and determined that such delegations would be sustainable if
HUD retains the authority to make adjustments to the insured mortgage amount up to and including the time of final endorsement.
As long as the Department retains such ultimate authority, case law supports the legality of such delegation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD's reservation of final authority to adjust the insured mortgage amount is not meant to suggest that HUD will, as
a matter of policy, routinely review all decisions about insured advances and cost certification. On the contrary,
the draft administrative instructions advise HUD Field Office staff to review a random sample against the HFA's procedures,
not HUD's. Further, it states that few projects would likely be subject to any reduction in the mortgage amount. It
is noted further that in HUD's own cost certification processes, few mortgage reductions are actually made. It has
been emphasized in both written and oral communications to the Field staff that the Risk-Sharing program is a partnership
and that the HUD Offices and HFAs should develop a strong working relationship where expectations on both sides are
clear, including procedures for insured advances and cost certification.

Commenter 12 objected to the prohibition against assignment of a mortgage and the requirement that legal title to
the mortgage be held by the HFA. The commenter stated that substantial interest rate savings can be generated if insured
loans can be sold directly in the market rather than being used as collateral for a bond issue. The commenter urged that
these requirements be deleted, at least for Level I participants, where an HFA has a significant residual interest
and risk, and where the HFA retains servicing.

The regulations require that the HFA be the mortgagee of record throughout the period of insurance. For the pilot program,
HUD has determined that this provision is desirable to ensure that the HFA fully maintain its risk-sharing obligation
in these transactions. However, the interim and final rules do allow transfer of up to 100 percent of the beneficial
interest in a loan or pool of loans.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has provided for a full 5 years after a claim is paid for an HFA to dispose of a project. HUD must be able
to assess its total liability and 5 years was considered to be a reasonable time period. This should be ample time for
disposition by the HFA, and the Department fully expects projects to be disposed of within this time. Sales of projects
within this 5-year period will result in a final claim settlement based on the sales price and an actual loss amount.
However, a final settlement established through appraisals that may be artificially low based on failure to sell
during the 5-year period could result in a significant windfall at the Government's expense within a short time. The
Department must preclude this from happening. In any event, we anticipate and expect that HFAs will endeavor to dispose
of defaulted properties well within the 5 years and receive a final claim settlement based on an actual loss amount.

The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this rule before
publication and by approving it certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. The program will provide a new system of federal credit enhancements to expand the Nation's
supply of affordable housing. Qualified State and local housing finance agencies will participate in the program
on a voluntary basis.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that the
provisions of this rule will not have a significant impact on family formation, maintenance or well being, except
to the extent that the program authorized by the rule will increase the supply of affordable housing, thereby improving
the ability of families to find decent and affordable housing. Any such impact is beneficial and merits no further
review under the Order.

The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12611, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this rule will not have substantial direct effects on States or their political subdivisions,
or the relationship between the Federal government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities
among the various levels of government. The Department has specifically provided in this rule that its regulation
on preemption of State or local rent control laws does not apply to this program. Any preemption of those laws for purposes
of the housing provided under the program will be done under authority granted the HFAs by State or local law. All authority
delegated to HFAs by HUD under this program was done so because the Department believes that is the intent of Congress
under section 542(c).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Section 542 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 directs the Secretary of the Department of Housing
and Urban Development, acting through the Federal Housing Administration, to carry out programs that will demonstrate
the effectiveness of providing new forms of Federal credit enhancement for multifamily loans. Section 542, entitled,
``Multifamily Mortgage Credit Demonstrations,'' provides new independent insurance authority that is not under
the National Housing Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Section 542(c) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 specifically directs the Secretary to carry
out a pilot program of risk-sharing with qualified State and local housing finance agencies (HFAs). The qualified
HFAs are authorized to underwrite and process loans. HUD will provide full mortgage insurance on affordable multifamily
housing projects processed by such HFAs under this program. Through risk-sharing agreements with HUD, HFAs contract
to reimburse HUD for a portion of the loss from any defaults that occur while HUD insurance is in force. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The extent to which HUD will direct qualified HFAs regarding their underwriting standards and loan terms and conditions
is related to the proportion of the risk taken by an HFA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Purpose. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The primary purpose of this pilot program is to test the effectiveness of providing new forms of credit enhancement
for multifamily loans, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
utilization of full insurance by HUD, pursuant to risk-sharing agreements with qualified housing finance agencies,
for the development of affordable housing. The utilization of Federal credit enhancements should increase access
to capital markets and, thereby, increase the supply of affordable multifamily housing. By permitting HFAs to underwrite,
process, and service loans and to manage and dispose of properties that fall into default, HUD expects affordable
housing to be made available to eligible families and individuals in a timely manner.

Affordable housing 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
means a project in which 20 percent or more of the units are both rent-restricted and occupied by families whose income
is 50 percent or less of the area median income as determined by HUD, with adjustments for household size, or in which
40 percent (25 percent in New York City) or more of the units are both rent-restricted and occupied by families whose
income is 60 percent or less of the area median income as determined by HUD, with adjustments for household size. A residential
unit is rent-restricted if the gross rent with respect to such unit does not exceed 30 percent of the imputed income
limitation applicable to such unit.

means a residential facility for independent living that is regulated by State or local government that provides
continuous protective oversight and assistance with the activities of daily living to frail elderly persons or other
persons needing such assistance. Continuous protective oversight may range from as little as awareness on the part
of management staff of residents' whereabouts (and the ability to intervene in the event of crisis) to a higher level
of services and assistance. Assistance with the activities of daily living may include, but is not limited to, bathing,
dressing, eating, getting in and out of bed or chairs, walking, going outdoors, using the toilet, laundry, home management,
meal preparation, shopping, supervision of medication, and housework.

 An HFA with a top tier or equivalent designation or an HFA with an overall rating of ``A'' on its general obligation bonds
is not required to have additional reserves so long as the HFA maintains that designation or rating, unless the Commissioner
determines that a prescribed level of reserves is necessary. If the designation or rating is lost, the HFA must immediately

of HUD for the purpose of meeting the HFA's risk-sharing obligations under this part. The account must be established
prior to the execution of any Risk Sharing Agreement under this part in an initial amount of not less than $500,000.
Thereafter, the HFA must deposit at each loan closing and thereafter maintain the following additional amounts in
the dedicated account: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) $10.00 per $1,000 of the unpaid principal balance that is equal to or less than $50 million; plus

 Financing of existing properties without substantial rehabilitation is allowed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If an existing multifamily project is being acquired and HUD insurance under this part will be used to facilitate
the acquisition of projects to increase the supply of affordable housing, such acquisitions are permissible if the
HUD insured mortgage does not exceed the sum of the total cost of acquisition, cost of financing, cost of repairs, and
reasonable transaction costs as determined by the Commissioner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the property is subject to an HFA-financed loan to be refinanced and such refinancing will result in the preservation
of affordable housing, refinancing of these properties is permissible if project occupancy is not less than 93 percent
(to include consideration of rent in arrears), based on the average occupancy in the project over the most recent 12
months, and the mortgage does not exceed an amount supportable by the lower of the unit rents being collected under
the rental assistance agreement or the unit rents being collected at unassisted projects in the market area that are
similar in amenities and location to the project for which insurance is being requested. The HUD-insured mortgage
may not exceed the sum of the existing indebtedness, cost of refinancing, the cost of repairs and reasonable transaction
costs as determined by the Commissioner. If a loan to be refinanced has been in default within the 12 months prior to
application for refinancing, the HFA must assume not less than 50 percent of the risk.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Transient housing or hotels. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Rental for transient or hotel purposes. For purposes of this part, rental for transient or hotel purposes means: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Rental for any period less than 30 days, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Any rental, if the occupants of the housing accommodations are provided customary hotel services such as room

size metropolitan housing market area or a remote or isolated nonmetropolitan area where: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Military-connected households comprise 25 percent or more of the total households in the market area. Military-connected
households include active duty military personnel, civilian employees of the military service (Department of Defense)
or other Federal agency at or in support of the installation, and employees of contractors and sub-contractors directly
associated with the military installation, and their dependents. Unaccompanied active duty military personnel
housed in military-controlled group quarters housing (barracks, BOQ's) are excluded; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) There is concern about the continued stability of the current level of military strength and mission at the installation
based on public announcements from the Department of Defense or the military service of impending changes; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The complete reduction of military-connected households living in nonmilitary rental housing over a 5 year period,
at an annual average decline of 20 percent, would, taking into account growth in the civilian economy and normal changes
in the housing inventory, cause an adverse impact on the private rental market resulting in an increase in the rental
vacancy rate in the housing market of 10 percent or more at the end of that period.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) No advance under a mortgage on a project subject to Davis-Bacon wage rates under paragraph (a) of this section shall
be eligible for insurance under this part unless the HFA determines (in accordance with the Commissioner's administrative
procedures) that the general contractor or any subcontractor or any firm, corporation, partnership or association
in which the contractor or subcontractor has a substantial interest was not, on the date the contract or subcontract
was executed, on the ineligible list established by the Comptroller General, pursuant 29 CFR 5.12, issued by the Secretary

e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
payroll review and routine interviews) and other routine administration and enforcement functions, subject to
monitoring by the Commissioner. Where routine administration and enforcement functions are delegated to the HFA,
the HFA shall bear financial responsibility for any deficiency in payment of prevailing wages or, where applicable
under 29 CFR part 1, any increase in compensation to a contractor, that is attributable to any failure properly to carry
out its delegated functions. For example, failure of an HFA to supply or ensure inclusion of the proper contract clauses
or wage determination in a contract or building loan agreement may require the HFA to fund increased compensation
to a contractor as the result of increased wages attributable to incorporation of the proper clauses and wage determination.

General.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 HUD will agree to insure periodic advances of mortgage proceeds or to insure the entire mortgage upon completion of
construction for projects involving new construction or substantial rehabilitation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing projects without the need for substantial rehabilitation will be considered insurance upon completion
cases. In insurance upon completion cases, only the permanent loan is insured and a single endorsement is required
after satisfactory completion of construction, substantial rehabilitation or repairs. In periodic advances cases,
progress payments approved by the HFA and both an initial and final endorsement on the mortgage are required.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Periodic advances will be authorized by the HFA subject to terms specified by the Commissioner.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
New construction and substantial rehabilitation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An HFA may approve a loan that will be insured upon completion of construction of the project. The HFA approval must
prescribe a designated period during which the mortgagor must start construction or substantial rehabilitation.
If construction or rehabilitation is started as required, the approval will be valid for the period estimated by the
HFA for construction and loan closing, including any extension approved by the HFA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Existing projects with no substantial rehabilitation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Existing projects with or without repairs are only insured upon completion, although HFAs may permit noncritical
repairs to be completed after endorsement upon establishment of escrows acceptable to the HFA.

(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Inspections.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The HFA must inspect projects under this part at such times during construction, substantial rehabilitation, or
repairs as the HFA determines. The inspections must be conducted to assure compliance with plans and specifications,
work write-ups, and other contract documents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Approval of advances.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 At all times, the loan must be kept in balance, and advances approved only if warranted by construction progress evidenced
through HFA inspection, as well as in accord with plans, specifications, work write-ups and other contract documents.
In approving advances, HFAs must make certain that other mortgageable items are supported with proper bills and/or
receipts before funds can be approved and advanced for insurance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Cost certification.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In order to ensure that the final amount for insurance is supported by certified costs: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The mortgagor (and general contractor, if there is an identity of interest with the mortgagor) must execute a certificate
of actual costs, in a form acceptable to the HFA, when all physical improvements are completed to the satisfaction
of the HFA and before final endorsement; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The cost certification provided by the mortgagor must be audited by an independent public accountant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Contestability.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Although the HFA has authority to approve the mortgagor's (and general contractor's) certification of cost, the
certification will be contestable by the Commissioner during the period up to and including final endorsement of
the mortgage. After final endorsement, the certification will be final and incontestable except for fraud or material
misrepresentation on the part of the mortgagor (and/or general contractor).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Amortization. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The mortgage must provide for complete amortization (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Use restrictions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The mortgage must contain a covenant prohibiting the use of the property for any purpose other than the purpose intended
on the day the mortgage was executed. The conversion of a project from rental to cooperative is not a ``change in use''
as that term is employed in the mortgage since the property will continue to have a residential use both before and after
conversion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Hazard insurance. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The mortgage must contain a covenant, acceptable to the HFA, that binds the mortgagor to keep the property insured
by one or more standard policies for fire and other hazards stipulated by the HFA. A standard mortgagee clause making
loss payable to the HFA must be included in the mortgage. The HFA is responsible for assuring that insurance is maintained
in force and in the amount required by this paragraph and the mortgage. The HFA must ensure that the insurance coverage
is in an amount that will comply with the coinsurance clause applicable to the location and character of the property,
but not less than 80 percent of the actual cash value of the insurable improvements and equipment. If the mortgagor
does not obtain the required insurance, the HFA must do so and assess the mortgagor for such costs. These insurance
requirements apply as long as the HFA retains an interest in the project and final claim settlement has not been completed
or the contract of insurance has not been otherwise terminated.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Modification of terms. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The mortgage must contain a covenant requiring that, in the event that the HFA and owner agree to a modification of the
terms of the mortgage (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Definition of default. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) A monetary default exists when the mortgagor fails to make any payment due under the mortgage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A covenant default exists when the mortgagor fails to perform any other covenant under the provision of the mortgage
or the regulatory agreement, which is incorporated by reference in the mortgage. An HFA becomes eligible for insurance
benefits on the basis of a covenant default only after the HFA has accelerated the debt and the owner has failed to pay
the full amount due, thus converting a covenant default into a monetary default. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Date of default. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of this subpart, the date of default is: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The date of the first uncorrected failure to perform a mortgage covenant or obligation; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The date of the first failure to make a monthly payment that is not covered by subsequent payments, when such subsequent
payments are applied to the overdue monthly payments in the order in which they were due. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice of default. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a default (as defined in paragraph (a) of this section) continues for a period of 30 days, the HFA must notify the Commissioner
within 10 days thereafter, unless the default is cured within the 30-day period. Unless waived by the Commissioner,
the HFA must submit this notice monthly, on a form prescribed by the Commissioner, until the default has been cured
or the HFA has filed an application for an initial claim payment. In cases of mortgage acceleration, the mortgagee
must first give notice of the default. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Timing of claim filing. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Unless a written extension is granted by HUD, the HFA must file an application for initial claim payment (or, if appropriate,
for partial claim payment) within 75 days from the date of default and may do so as early as the first day of the month following
the month for which a payment was missed. Upon request of the HFA, HUD may extend, up to 180 days from the date of default,
the deadline for filing a claim. In those cases where the HFA certifies that the project owner is in the process of transacting
a bond refunder, refinancing the mortgage, or changing the ownership for the purpose of curing the default and bringing
the mortgage current, HUD may extend the deadline for filing a claim beyond 180 days, not to exceed 360 days from the
date of default.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The HFA Debenture should follow the standard form of a State/Municipal Debenture issued under the Uniform Commercial
Code, where applicable, and shall be supported by the full faith and credit of the HFA. For HFAs that operate as departments

Where actions taken or caused to be taken by the HFA have the effect of the recovery of less than the face amount of the

not sold the project, an appraisal should be made to determine the value of the project at its highest and best use.

If the initial claim amount, as determined under &sect;266.628(a)(1), is less than HUD's share of the loss, HUD shall
make a final claim payment to the HFA that is equal to the difference between HUD's share of the loss and the initial claim
amount and shall return the HFA Debenture to the HFA for cancellation.

HFA reimbursement payment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the initial claim amount, as determined under &sect;266.628(a)(1), is more than HUD's share of the loss, the HFA
shall, within 30 days of notification by HUD of the amount due, remit to HUD an amount that is equal to the difference
between the initial claim amount and HUD's share of the loss. The funds must be remitted in a manner prescribed in the
Commissioner's administrative procedures. The HFA Debenture will be considered redeemed upon receipt of the cash
payment. A 5 percent penalty will be charged and interest at the debenture rate will begin to accrue if the cash payment
is not received within the prescribed period. If an HFA is in default under an existing debenture and files a claim on
another project under this part, HUD will charge the HFA's Dedicated Account for the amount owed the Department. In
cases of top-tier or A-rated HFA's which are not required to maintain a Dedicated Account, HUD will inform the rating
agencies of the HFA's failure to pay on their debt obligation and of its violation of the Risk-Sharing Agreement.
