Section 4434 of Public Law 102&hyph;484, the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1993, amended section
6304(d) of title 5, United States Code, to consider the closure of an installation of the Department of Defense (DOD),
during the period from October 1, 1992, through December 31, 1997, as ``an exigency of the public business'' for the
purpose of restoring annual leave accumulated in excess of the maximum permitted by law. This amendment also provides
that any annual leave in excess of the annual maximum limitation under 5 U.S.C. 6304(a) accrued by an employee at a closing
DOD installation must be restored and credited to the employee in a separate leave account. This provision enables
installations to keep their already reduced staffs at work while permitting employees to avoid forfeiture of leave.
In addition, it reduces the administrative time that would have been spent by employees and managers in scheduling,
canceling, and restoring ``use or lose'' annual leave each leave year.

Sections 341 and 2816 of Public Law 103&hyph;337, October 5, 1994, the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal
year 1995, expanded 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3) to cover employees of DOD installations identified as ``realigning locations''
under the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (BRAC) and eliminated the time period for application of
5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3) if the closure or realignment action is under BRAC. The October 1, 1992, through December 31, 1997,
time frame in 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3) continues to apply to the closure of DOD installations not covered by BRAC.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Time Limit for Using Restored Annual Leave
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the current 5 CFR 630.306, all restored leave must be scheduled and used not later than the end of the leave year
ending 2 years after the termination date of the exigency of the public business_i.e., the closure or completion of
the realignment of the DOD installation and/or transfer of the employee to another installation or agency. Employees
remaining at closing DOD installations or BRAC designated realignment installations over several leave years may
accumulate large amounts of restored leave in their separate accounts. When the exigency of the public business terminates,
the employee must schedule and use all of the restored leave by the end of the leave year ending 2 years after the termination
date of the exigency of the public business. As a result, the employer must deal with the consequence of the employee
using sizeable amounts of leave within 2 to 3 years after the transfer or completion of the realignment. At the same
time, annual leave that accrues during that 2- to 3-year period routinely creates a ``use or lose'' situation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To help alleviate this situation, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is revising 5 CFR 630.306 to establish
a longer period of time for using annual leave restored under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3) based on the amount of restored leave
in the employee's separate leave account. The time limit would be calculated using a formula similar to the formula
used for determining the time limit for using annual leave restored in back pay situations. (See 5 CFR 550.805(g).)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the interim regulations, a full-time employee would be required to schedule and use excess annual leave of 416
hours or less by the end of the leave year in progress 2 years after the date the employee is no longer subject to 5 U.S.C.
6304(d)(3). The agency would extend that period by 1 leave year for each additional 208 hours of excess annual leave
or any portion thereof. A part-time employee would be required to schedule and use excess annual leave in an amount
equal to or less than 20 percent of the number of hours in the employee's scheduled annual tour of duty by the end of the
leave year in progress 2 years after the date the employee is no longer subject to 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3). The agency would
extend this period by 1 leave year for each additional number of hours of excess annual leave, or any portion thereof,
equal to 10 percent of the number of hours in the employee's scheduled annual tour of duty.

Movement From One DOD Installation Undergoing Closure or Realignment to Another Such Installation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the current 5 CFR 630.306, the time limit for using annual leave restored under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3) begins when
an employee moves from a closing DOD installation or a DOD installation undergoing realignment, even if the employee
is transferring to another DOD installation subject to closure or realignment. This creates a situation that is directly
opposite to the result that 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3) was intended to correct. Employees who move from one DOD installation
undergoing closure or realignment to another such installation without a break in service are under strict time constraints
to use their restored leave. At the same time, they are needed at work because of reduced staff levels. Supervisors
and managers may be hesitant to deny leave requests because restored leave that is forfeited cannot be recovered.
Further complicating the situation is the fact that these employees may be entitled to additional restored leave
under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OPM agrees with DOD's conclusion that the exigency of the public business that allows for the accrual of annual leave
above the annual maximum limitation does not terminate when an employee moves from one closing or realigning installation
to another such installation without a break in service. Therefore, OPM's regulations will defer starting the time
limit for using restored leave until the employee no longer works at a closing DOD installation or a DOD installation
undergoing realignment.

Movement to an Installation Undergoing Closure or Realignment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When an employee moves to a closing DOD installation or a DOD installation undergoing realignment, 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3)
only permits the restoration of annual leave that exceeds the annual maximum carry-over limitation. There is no similar
protection for an ``active'' restored annual leave account_i.e., an account of restored annual leave that was established
under other conditions permitting restoration of annual leave under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d). Although the employee is needed
to work at the installation that is undergoing closure or realignment, the employee (and the agency) have little option
but to use (or permit the use of) the leave in the ``active'' restored leave account to avoid the forfeiture of annual
leave. This situation is also inconsistent with the overall intent of 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OPM's revision of &sect;630.306, as discussed above, will also alleviate this problem, since the time limitation
for using a restored leave account will be canceled for the entire period during which an employee is subject to 5 U.S.C.
6304(d)(3). After the employee's coverage under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3) ends, a new time limit will be established for
all restored leave available to the employee under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d). The new time limit for using restored leave will
begin on the date the employee is no longer subject to 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3).

Advance Scheduling of Annual Leave
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the current 5 CFR 630.308, before annual leave forfeited under section 6304 of title 5, United States Code, may
be considered for restoration under that section, use of the annual leave must have been scheduled in writing before
the start of the third biweekly pay period prior to the end of the leave year. Under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3), employees at
closing DOD installations or DOD installations undergoing realignment are permitted to have excess annual leave
restored without meeting the requirement for advance scheduling of annual leave.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOD has identified two problems that are encountered by an employee whose coverage under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3) ends
during the leave year. Some of these employees face forfeiting ``use or lose'' annual leave at the end of the leave year
at the new installation because they are unable to show any evidence of advance scheduling of annual leave. Other employees
request that a ``restored'' annual leave account be established at the time of their transfer or the completion of
the realignment of the DOD installation, even though accrued annual leave is not subject to forfeiture until the end
of the leave year. Under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d), excess annual leave cannot be considered for restoration until after the
end of the leave year in which it is forfeited.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An employee whose coverage under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3) ends late in the leave year may find it impossible to schedule
all annual leave that would be subject to forfeiture before the end of the leave year. DOD has requested that OPM amend
&sect;630.308 to allow agencies to consider restoration of annual leave forfeited at the end of the leave year to an
employee whose coverage under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3) ends during the leave year if the employee can demonstrate a correlation
between the lack of advance scheduling and coverage under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OPM agrees that such annual leave may be considered for restoration. We have revised the regulations to require affected
employees to make a reasonable effort to comply with the advance scheduling requirement in 5 CFR 630.308(a). However,
the head of the agency may exempt employees from the advance scheduling requirement if the employee can show that he
or she was covered by 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3) during the leave year 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that he or she was unable to comply with the scheduling requirement due to circumstances beyond his or her control.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although an employee may be exempt from the advance scheduling requirement, this does not 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
guarantee
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that the employee's excess annual leave will be restored, since there may have been sufficient time to schedule and
use his or her annual leave before the end of the leave year. Annual leave restored to the employee for the current leave
year is subject to the time limitations established in 5 CFR 630.306(a).

Sections 341 and 2816 of Public Law 103&hyph;337, which broadened coverage under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3), were effective
on October 5, 1994. In order to give practical effect to this legislation, I find good cause exists to waive the general
notice of proposed rulemaking pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B). Also, I find that good cause exists for making this
rule effective in less than 30 days. The delay in the effective date is being waived to give affected employees the benefit
of these new provisions.

(a) Except as otherwise authorized under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section or other regulation, annual leave
restored under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d) must be scheduled and used not later than the end of the leave year ending 2 years after:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The date of restoration of the annual leave forfeited because of administrative error; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A full-time employee shall schedule and use excess annual leave of 416 hours or less by the end of the leave year in
progress 2 years after the date the employee is no longer subject to 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3). The agency shall extend this
period by 1 leave year for each additional 208 hours of excess annual leave or any portion thereof.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule amends the Food Distribution Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations to strengthen the provisions concerning the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing of donated food and to increase the uniformity between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the provisions governing the State processing program and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Commodity Processing (NCP) Program. The changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporated in this final rule reflect the results of two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
national meetings: a meeting held to discuss ideas on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improving the administration of the State processing and the NCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Programs and the Department's Paperwork Reduction Task Force 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meeting held to discuss ways to reduce the paperwork burden 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with the processing programs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Task Force in August 1990 and subsequently incorporated into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USDA's 1990 Report to Congress were included in this final

These programs are listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assistance under 10.550 and are subject to the provisions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consultation with State and local officials (7 CFR Part 3015, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart V and final rule-related notices published at 48 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
29114, June 24, 1983 and 49 FR 22676, May 31, 1984). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Civil Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have preemptive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect with respect to any State or local laws, regulations or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policies which conflict with its provisions or which would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
otherwise impede its full implementation. This rule is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended to have retroactive effect unless so specified in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Effective Date'' section of this preamble. Prior to any judicial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
challenge to the provisions of this rule or the application of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its provisions, all applicable administrative procedures must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exhausted. This includes any administrative procedures provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by State or local governments. For disputes involving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procurements by State agencies and sponsors, this includes any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative appeal procedures to the extent required by 7 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Parts 3015 or 3016. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of Agriculture is committed to carrying out its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statutory and regulatory mandates in a manner that best serves 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the public interest. Therefore, where legal discretion permits, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Department actively seeks to promulgate regulations that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promote economic growth, create jobs, are minimally burdensome 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and are easy for the public to understand, use or comply with. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In short, the Department is committed to issuing regulations that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximize net benefits to society and minimize costs imposed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Section 250.30 of the current Food Distribution Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations sets forth the terms and conditions under which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distributing agencies, subdistributing agencies, and recipient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies may enter into contracts with commercial firms for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing donated foods and prescribes the minimum requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be included in such contracts. Part 252 sets forth the terms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and conditions under which the Food and Consumer Service (FCS) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and commercial firms may enter into National Commodity Processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(NCP) Program contracts for the processing and distribution of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designated donated foods to eligible recipient agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 25, 1993, the Department published a proposed rule in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 29985) which would amend the Food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Distribution Program regulations to strengthen provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerning the processing of donated foods and to increase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uniformity between provisions governing State processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities, Part 250, and those governing NCP Program, Part 252. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule provided a 60-day comment period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule addresses those provisions regarding food service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management companies, contract renewal, requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing contracts, liquidated damages, alternate value pass-through systems, invoice information, substitution
of donated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
food, time frames for processors to pay refunds, refund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications/performance reports, and list of contracting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Please note that a typographical error in the proposed rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published on May 25, 1993, (58 FR 29995) misidentified section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
250.30(k)(3) as section 250.30(k)(4). The Department apologizes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for any inconvenience this may have caused in reviewing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule for comment. Throughout this final rule, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correct section number will be referred to when discussing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of that proposed rule in order to avoid further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confusion. However, the Department recognizes that the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 250.30(k)(4) is obsolete, in that it requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distributing agencies to notify processors of the total amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
donated cheese they can receive during the 1988&hyph;1989 school year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because this requirement is no longer pertinent to current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program operations, the Department is removing this language from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the regulations.

Analysis of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department received a total of 41 comment letters from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distributing agencies, local school food authorities, commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
food processors, a State school food service association, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
private sector representative, the American Commodity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Distribution Association, and the American School Food Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Association.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 250.3 and 250.30(a) of the proposed rule would revise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the definition of ``processor'' and associated requirements to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remove the blanket exception from the State processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations for commercial food service management companies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the proposed rule would revise the definition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``processor'' to exempt any commercial enterprises which handle, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepare, and/or serve products or meals containing donated foods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on-site solely for the individual recipient agency under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the removal of the blanket exception for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial food service management companies from the definition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of ``processor,'' twenty-five comments were received. All 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters supported this proposal for the reasons set forth in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the preamble of the proposed rule. The Department proposed this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change because of problems identified in the past when food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service management companies use commercial facilities to produce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
items for the various school food authorities under contract.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the current regulations, it is often difficult to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if donated food is used to produce meals for the appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipient agency and if the value of the donated food is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflected in a reduction of the food service management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
companies' fees to the recipient agencies. Because these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
companies are exempt from the processing regulations, there is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
little the distributing agency or recipient agency can do to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitor commodity inventories. Based on the reasons set forth in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the preamble to the proposed rule and the overwhelming response 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from commenters in favor of the proposal, the blanket exclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of food service management companies from the State processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations is eliminated from the section 250.3 definition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``processor'' and &sect;250.30(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thirty-three comments were received regarding the proposed change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the definition of ``processor'' to exempt any commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enterprises which handle, prepare and/or serve products or meals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing donated foods on-site solely for the individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipient agency under contract. Thirty-two commenters were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opposed to this change, primarily as it applied to recipient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies. Of this number, twenty-five commenters believed that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all recipient agencies providing meals to other recipient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies, whether on-site or off-site, should be exempt from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor requirements of Part 250. Several commenters stated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the use of commodities could be monitored satisfactorily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through existing food distribution review standards. Another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter stated that recipient agencies should be exempt from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this requirement if they provide for accountability and value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pass-through for the donated food. This commenter stated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this could be accomplished by ensuring that funds obtained from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meals furnished to other recipient agencies are deposited into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the recipient agency's food service account. Other commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated that the proposed rule defining a school food authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which provides meals to summer feeding programs, child and adult 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
day care centers, senior citizens and others as a processor is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not practical. One commenter stated that the definition could be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrected by adding a sentence to the definition that donated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
food recipient agencies which prepare their own meals on-site and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepare meals for other recipient agencies at the same location 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are also exempt from this definition. One commenter stated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
schools and child care centers should not be classified as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial food service management companies if they are eligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for participation as recipient agencies in child nutrition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that many of the commenters' responses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were based on the discussion in the preamble of the proposed rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which dealt with situations in which one recipient agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepares meals for another recipient agency. A recipient agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which prepares meals for other recipient agencies is a food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service management company under the definition in &sect;250.3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The preamble stated that the Department believes that where a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonprofit recipient agency, such as a school food authority, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepares products or meals containing donated foods for more than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one recipient agency under more than one contract in the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility or prepares products or meals for any one recipient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency off-site, that recipient agency is operating as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial food service management company and must comply with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processing provisions of Part 250 pursuant to the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes to the definition of ``processor'' in &sect;250.3. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
majority of the commenters stated that recipient agencies that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepare meals for other recipient agencies should be exempt from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being defined as a processor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the concerns raised by the commenters, however, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of ``processor'' in &sect;250.3 of this final rule is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended to provide that recipient agencies which prepare products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or meals containing donated foods for more than one recipient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency under more that one contract in the same facility or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepare products or meals for any one recipient agency off-site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are excluded from the definition of ``processor'' if the recipient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency preparing products or meals can provide accountability for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any donated foods received from another recipient agency in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with &sect;250.16 of the Food Distribution Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations and any funds received as payment for preparing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products or meals shall be deposited in the meal account of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipient agency preparing the products or meals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Fee-for-Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 250.3 of the proposed rule would define the term ``fee-for-service'' and delete the obsolete definition
of ``processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fee''. Sections 250.30 (d) and (e) of the proposed rule would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reorganized to clarify refund, discount, hybrid and alternate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value pass-through systems and to incorporate procedures for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
billing fee-for-service end products. Additionally, under &sect;250.30(c)(4)(viii)(D) of the proposed rule
the processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contract would require those processors who wished to give credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for by-products via a reduction in the fee-for-service price to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identify in the contract the specific dollar value amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflected in the lowered price. Under &sect;250.30(e)(3) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed rule, end products containing meat or poultry, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
together with any other donated food, would be prohibited from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being delivered and sold to recipient agencies through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distributors under fee-for-service contracts. The proposed rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would allow end products containing meat or poultry and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional ingredients which are not donated foods, to be sold to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipient agencies through distributors under fee-for-service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contracts. The proposed rule would also permit end products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing meat or poultry, together with other donated food sold 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directly to recipient agencies by the processor, to be sold under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fee-for-service contracts. FCS was particularly interested in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments and recommendations regarding the impact this proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would have on any products which were manufactured using a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combination of meat and poultry and other donated food and sold 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through distributors and possible alternatives to the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule on this point. A total of fifteen comments was received on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the above proposals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eight commenters responded to the proposed definition of ``fee-for-service.'' Four of these commenters agreed
with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition as it was proposed. The remaining four commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated that the definition needed to be expanded. Three of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters in favor of expansion stated that the fee-for-service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
price and the free on board (FOB) plant price are the same prices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and this should be reflected in the final rule. They stated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the FOB price is the actual cost of producing the end product, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and that this price should be the same for all States; the only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difference in price would be the cost of transportation to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deliver the finished end products back to each State. These same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters said that this concept would mean that each processor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would only have to prepare one end product data schedule for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entire nation. This action would make the idea of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clearinghouse for end product data schedules become a reality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other commenter wanted the definition of fee-for-service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expanded to clearly state that it is a method of payment for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing services and is an alternative to a value pass-through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system, in addition to being the price representing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor's cost of ingredients, packaging, and overhead. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department disagrees with the commenters that stated that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FOB price and the fee-for-service price represent the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
figures. The FOB price represents the processor's cost of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
producing an item prior to shipment and delivery. FOB pricing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
includes the cost of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ingredients used in the manufacture of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the product; the price reduction for donated food is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflected in the FOB price. Fee-for-service, on the other hand, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
represents the cost of ingredients (other than donated food) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labor, packaging, overhead, and other costs incurred in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conversion of the donated food into the specified end product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The net case price (the FOB price minus the commodity discount or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refund for the donated food) and fee-for-service are equivalent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prices. The Department believes that the definition of fee-for-service is correct as written in the proposed rule,
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore, the definition is adopted without change in the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Four comments, all in favor, were received in response to section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
250.30(c)(4)(viii)(D) of the proposed rule which would require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the value credits of any by-products to be listed on the end 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product data schedule. Two of these commenters stated that they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently require this information to be part of the processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement. This provision is adopted without change in the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Only one comment, which was favorable, was received on section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
250.30(e)(1)(iv) of the proposed rule which would establish new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fee-for-service billing procedures. Distributing agencies have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been using the proposed fee-for-service billing procedures for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of years without problem pursuant to a policy memo dated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
March 22, 1989. Therefore, this final rule contains these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Two commenters were in favor of section 250.30(e)(3) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule which would restrict the sale of end products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing both substitutable and non-substitutable (meat and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
poultry) donated food through distributors to either the refund, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hybrid, or alternate value pass-through system and nine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters were opposed. Those who were opposed to the proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wanted to have the option to approve the sale of end products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing both substitutable and non-substitutable donated food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under fee-for-service arrangements. Additionally, several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters were opposed to the use of the term ``sold'' in section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
250.30(e)(3) of the proposed rule in regard to end products being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``sold'' to recipient agencies through distributors. They stated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that fee-for-service end products should be delivered but not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
sold 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to a distributor. One commenter stated that the word ``sold'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implied that any quantity of end product can be purchased by any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipient agency. That commenter further said that this is in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contrast to the actual availability of a commodity and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation process that is associated with non-substitutable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commodities that is used by FCS and distributing agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Four comments were received on the impact that the proposal would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make on end products manufactured from both substitutable and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-substitutable donated food and delivered through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distributors. However, only one commenter provided a possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative to the proposed rule. That commenter stated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
since distributing agencies, and ultimately recipient agencies, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receive specific allocations of meat and poultry, the quantity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meat and poultry made available to a processor should be pre-assigned, based on a fair share apportionment and the
recipient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency's choice. The pre-assigned end products may then be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned to the recipient agency through a distributor. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fee-for-service billing process through a distributor for all end 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products containing meat or poultry which are sold through a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distributor would be accomplished by either: 1) a dual billing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system through which the recipient agency is billed by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor for the fee-for-service and the distributor bills for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the storage and delivery of end products or 2) a system through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the processor bills separately for the fee-for-service and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the distributor's storage and delivery charges. If these end 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products should also contain substitutable foods, that portion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the value pass-through could be handled as a refund or discount, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicated on the processor's invoice. Both types of information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could be shown on the end product data schedule. The other three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters pointed out the impact that the proposal would have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without proposing alternatives. Their comments are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1) if the proposed rule results in prohibiting end products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing protein from being sold via a distributor, unless 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified by a value pass-through system, it could result in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors leaving the program; 2) this proposed change may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result in meat and poultry processors choosing not to utilize 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
donated flour, oil, or other donated foods because they would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to choose a value pass-through system other than fee-for-service; 3) the use of fee-for-service is necessary
in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production of end products made with donated meat and poultry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because of the difficulty in replacing the donated product and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the prohibition against substitution; and 4) it is uncertain as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to how the use of a refund or discount system instead of a fee-for-service could assure that there was no substitution
of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial food for non-substitutable donated food. Due to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerns raised by the commenters opposed to the proposal, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 250.30(e)(3) of the proposed rule will not be adopted in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the final rule, and processing contracts may continue to be made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under fee-for-service arrangements when such end products are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delivered and sold through distributors, regardless of whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they are manufactured with both substitutable and non-substitutable donated foods.

Contract Extension

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under sections 250.30(c)(1) and 252.4(b) of the proposed rule, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing contracts would continue to be required to terminate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on June 30 of each year; however, contracting agencies (or FCS in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the case of NCP) would be given the option of extending contracts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for two 1-year periods. Section 250.30(c)(1) of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule would also require that any changed information be updated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before any contract extension is granted, including pricing and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
yield information, bonding information, and the signature page. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, section 250.30(c)(1) of the proposed rule would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide that contracts could be extended only if the processor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed satisfactorily during the previous year, submitted the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required annual reconciliation reports and had its certified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public accountant (CPA) audit report closed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 A total of eighteen commenters responded to this proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eleven commenters supported the provision as proposed. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter supported the option of two 1-year extensions, but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
added that requiring processors to submit the annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reconciliation report and requiring the closure of the CPA audit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report as conditions for contract extension are not workable due 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the submission and resolution time frames associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these reports. Another commenter supported the option of two 1-year extensions but stated that the annual reconciliation
reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be eliminated as a condition since the proposal for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submission of the monthly performance report with year-to-date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
totals would serve the same purpose. Four commenters were in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
favor of contract extension but recommended four 1-year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extensions to make processing contract extensions consistent with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the food service management company contract duration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements under 7 CFR Part 210. Three of these commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also recommended that bids should be separate and distinct from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processing agreement and not be subject to automatic renewal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, one commenter stated that contract extensions would not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result in reduced paperwork because distributing agencies would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have to maintain separate active contract files for each year of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the contract. This commenter added that if there were any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes from the original contract, the distributing agency would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need to issue additional amendments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The Department continues to believe sections 250.30(c)(1) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
252.4(b) of the proposed rule will reduce paperwork, facilitate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contract approval, and expedite the arrangement of early 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commodity shipments directly to processors. Based on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments on section 250.30(c)(1) of the proposed rule, however, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Department recognizes that the time frames for the submission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of certain reports, such as the annual reconciliation report or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closure of the CPA audit report, cannot practically be conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for contract extension. Annual reconciliation reports are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
due to be submitted to the distributing agencies until after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new contract year has begun. CPA audit reports are due prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extending a contract; however, the audit might not be closed at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the time of contract extension. Typically, distributing agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
begin negotiating contracts for the upcoming contract year in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
March or April. Because distributing agencies need to have the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most recent data available to them in determining whether a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing contract should be extended, this rule will require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that distributing agencies ensure that any changed information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be updated before any contract extension is granted, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including but not limited to pricing and yield information value, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bonding information, and signature page. The distributing agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also must ensure that all required reports and any corrections to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports that are due up to the time that contract extension 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurs have been submitted by the processor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Accordingly, this final rule adopts section 250.30(c)(1) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed State processing regulations and section 252.4(b) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed NCP regulations without change, except that section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
250.30(c)(1) is modified to provide that as a condition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

reports and any corrections to such reports up to the time that

Section 250.30(c)(4)(ii) of the proposed State processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations and section 252.4(c)(1) of the NCP regulations would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eliminate the requirement that the free on board (FOB) plant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
price be included as part of the State processing and NCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contracts. In lieu of the FOB price, the proposed rule would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit processors to provide any pricing information, so long as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processor thoroughly explained what this additional pricing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information represented. The processor, however, under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
250.30(c)(4)(ii) of the proposed rule would also be required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include the contract value of each USDA commodity and where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing was to be performed only on a fee-for-service basis, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as defined in the rule, the actual fee would be listed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, section 250.30(c)(4)(ii) of the proposed rule would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require that information pertaining to yields and pricing of end

A total of sixteen comments was received on this proposal. In response to the proposal to eliminate the FOB price from
the end product data schedule, six commenters agreed that it should be removed from the regulations and four commenters
stated that it should be retained. Commenters who supported the elimination of the FOB price stated that there is a
great deal of confusion regarding what the FOB price represents. One commenter stated that FOB prices are misleading
and believed it would be better to have a processor spell out the pricing mechanism as clearly as possible at the State
contract level. Two commenters proposed eliminating all pricing information from the end product data schedule.
One of these commenters stated that the FOB price causes confusion among recipient agencies and also reveals sensitive
information to a company's competitors should they obtain copies of the end product data schedule. The other commenter
stated that the FOB price is irrelevant and unauditable and there is no accurate means to compare price information
on the end product data schedule to actual price paid by the recipient agency. This same commenter said that the majority
of recipient agencies arrange for purchases through a bid process, and that the competitive market will control the
costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, this commenter stated that it would be better to eliminate the FOB price entirely and satisfy the audit
trail through: 1) payment of a refund which reflects the contract value; 2) documentation that the distributor reduced
the commercial price of the end product by the full contract value under the hybrid system; or 3) that the normal commercial
price has been discounted by the full contract value for sales made under the direct discount system. Another commenter
stated that only value pass-through information should be included on the end product data schedule and that full
pricing information, such as delivered price, should be included as a separate attachment to the agreement. Three
commenters supported the current requirement and indicated that delivery costs should also be identified on the
end product data schedule. Two commenters recommended that FOB price and fee-for-service definitions should be
clarified so that they are compatible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FCS is aware that pricing information supplied by processors often represents prices other than the FOB price. Many
processors use delivered price to a State warehouse, highest price that can be charged to a recipient agency, delivered
price to a recipient agency, etc. Based on this and the comments received, the Department believes that the requirement
that FOB price be included as part of the State and NCP processing contracts should be eliminated. However, because
the Department realizes that pricing information is very important to recipient agencies, the Department also believes
that processors should provide any pricing information requested by the contracting agency, along with a thorough
explanation of what this information represents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the proposal to place price and yield data on separate pages, four commenters were in favor of this idea and
seven were opposed. Those in favor stated that a two-part system could result in reduced paperwork and that processors
would not be required to submit new yield schedules for contract renewal or pricing changes. Another commenter stated
that if preparing a separate sheet for yields will lead to a uniform commodity yield allowances and these are clearly
related to end product, then the proposed changes may be desirable. That commenter further stated that the yield data
should be cross-referenced on the end product data schedule. Those commenters opposed to the proposed requirement
stated that placing price and yield data on separate pages doubles the paperwork required, not reduces it. Several
commenters stated that most processors have end product data schedules computerized, so it would be easier and more
efficient to create revised yield and pricing information on a single sheet. One commenter stated that the specific
reference to a two-part form should be removed from the regulations, but its removal would not prevent the use of a two-part
form if this is preferred by the processor and the distributing agency. Another commenter opposed the proposal to
have yield and pricing information on separate pages of the contract and preferred to have the gross and net pricing
columns eliminated from the current end product data schedule and leave the rest of the end product data schedule as
it currently exists.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department proposed placing pricing and yield data on separate pages because it was thought that this would eliminate
the need to update all end product data schedules when changes become necessary. However, the Department finds the
arguments made by the commenters opposed to the proposal persuasive, in that placing the information on separate
pages would increase the workload and paperwork for processors and distributing agencies. Additionally, with the
increased use of computer technology, it would be easier to update the end product data schedule rather than requiring
separate pages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule adopts &sect;250.30(c)(4)(ii) of the proposed State processing regulations and &sect;252.4(c)(1)
of the proposed NCP regulations without change, except that the proposal to require that price and yield data be placed
on separate pages is not incorporated into &sect;250.30(c)(4)(ii) of the final rule.

Liquidated Damages 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 250.30(c)(4)(iv)(B) of the current State processing regulations provides for termination of the processing
contract when there has been noncompliance with its terms and conditions by the contracting agency or the processor.
However, it has been the Department's experience that there have been circumstances where termination of processing
contracts would seriously affect the ability of recipient agencies to purchase processed end products. Rather than
terminating contracts for non-compliance with the contract provisions, the Department believes that there could
be some middle ground established where instances of non- compliance could be better handled by means of assessing
damages against the non-performing party of the contract under the State processing program. To accomplish this,
the proposed rule requested comments from interested parties on ways to handle instances of program violations,
short of contract termination. Commenters were requested to identify areas of non-compliance that have created
the greatest problems in the past as well as the type and amounts of reasonable damages for non-compliance with specific
provisions of the processing agreement to be applied against a processor. These liquidated damages were to be based
on the severity and nature of the program violations identified, in order to ensure consistent application of the
requirement. Additionally, comments were solicited regarding the incorporation of the liquidated damages provision
of the NCP agreement into the NCP regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Twelve comments were received in response to this proposal. Ten commenters were opposed to the inclusion of a liquidated
damages provision in the State processing and the NCP regulations. Many of these commenters stated that while the
concept of establishing conditions of non-compliance in lieu of contract termination could be useful as an incentive
for processors to adhere to contract requirements, addressing these conditions in Federal regulations is not appropriate.
Rather than include such provisions in Federal regulations, six commenters stated that distributing agencies should
be encouraged to identify liquidated damages assessments in a special provisions article of the processing agreement.
Three commenters expressed concern that inclusion of a liquidated damages provision could deter processors from
participating in the processing programs. Three commenters expressed concern that State laws are too varied and
that such provisions may invoke unnecessary or excessive charges against processors, which could ultimately result
in higher fees charged to recipient agencies. One commenter stated that most instances of non-compliance fall into
the area of recordkeeping problems, such as failure to submit reports in a timely manner or to maintain production
records. The commenter stated that the best way to handle such occurrences is for the distributing agency to work directly
with the processor to resolve these problems rather than to impose fines. Two commenters stated that adding a liquidated
damages provision to the NCP regulations would create undue hardship on a single processor with contracts in multiple
states. Three commenters stated that there was no need for a liquidated damages provision because the bond was sufficient
to cover the loss of any donated food. However, a different view point toward the bond coverage was expressed by two
commenters who were in favor of including a liquidated damages provision. One of these commenters stated that since
the bond only covers loss of inventory or loss of commodity, a liquidated damages provision would be appropriate if
very carefully written so that good processors would not be deterred from program participation and that such a provision
could not be punitive in nature. The other commenter in favor of a liquidated damages provision stated that while performance
bonds do provide some relief, they do not adequately compensate the State or the recipient agencies for the additional
administrative work which can result when a processor violates the provisions of the processing regulations and
agreement provisions. This commenter stated that a well-constructed liquidated damages provision may enable the
distributing agency to collect penalties which could be used to offset the administrative work that is generated
by such violations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the Department recognizes the need to have a means of addressing non-compliance with program and contract provisions,
other than contract termination, the majority of the commenters' recommendations stated that it would be inappropriate
for the Department to develop a liquidated damages provision that would be applicable to all distributing agencies
nationwide. Based on these comments, the Department believes that handling such instances of non-compliance is
best left to the discretion of the distributing agencies. Therefore, this rule does not require that a liquidated
damages provision be included in the State processing contract. However, as a means of ensuring compliance with all
requirements of the processing contract short of contract termination, the Department strongly encourages the
inclusion of a liquidated damages provision or other similar provision in the processing contract. As discussed
in the preamble to the proposed State processing regulations, there are circumstances in which termination of processing
contracts would seriously affect the ability of recipient agencies to purchase processed end products, and thus,
termination is not always a practical option for less significant contract noncompliance. It has been the Department's
experience in NCP that a liquidated damages provision has been a useful method of ensuring full compliance with the
terms of the contract. The Department will continue to appraise the use and effectiveness of liquidated damage provisions
or other intermediate alternatives to contract termination by distributing agencies and will address this issue
in the future if warranted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since FCS serves as the distributing agency in the NCP Program, and because this provision has been successfully applied
in the past to address instances of non-compliance, the liquidated damages article that is currently part of the NCP
agreement will remain unchanged. The Department plans to raise this issue with the distributing agencies participating
in the State processing program to determine whether it is appropriate to incorporate a similar provision in State
processing contracts.

Section 250.30(d)(1)(iii) of the proposed State processing regulations and section 252.4(c)(4)(iii) of the proposed
NCP regulations would permit FCS to take the paperwork and resource burden associated with using the alternate value
pass-through systems into consideration when determining whether an alternate system should be approved. The proposed
rule would also reserve to FCS the right to deny approval of systems which are labor- intensive and provide no greater
accountability than systems specifically described for use by the current regulations.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A total of twelve comments was received on this proposal, with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ten commenters being in favor of the provision, one commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being opposed, and one commenter possibly misunderstanding the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed provision. Six of the ten commenters supported the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision exactly as proposed, while the remaining four made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional suggestions for inclusion in the provision. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional suggestions were as follows: 1) the Department must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
develop specific objective guidelines to follow when reviewing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternate value pass-through systems to ensure that all systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are evaluated under the same criteria; 2) the Department must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider the burden an alternate system would place on smaller 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors, since they would probably have to use that system in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a State where it had been approved; and 3) any alternate value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pass-through system should be piloted for one year before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receiving full approval and reviewed every year thereafter to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that it is an accountable and efficient system. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department believes that one commenter may have misunderstood the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions, since concern was expressed that the Department was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing to eliminate the option of allowing alternate value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pass-through systems. Finally, the one commenter who was opposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the provision stated that there was no need for this proposal, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
since the Department already has the authority to approve or deny 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative value pass-through systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department supports the continued use of alternate value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pass-through systems with FCS approval under the State processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and NCP Programs. The Department also supports the proposal that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the paperwork and resource burden associated with an alternate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value pass-through system are extremely important factors that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be taken into consideration when determining whether an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternate system should be approved. The Department believes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that distributing agencies, recipient agencies, and processors do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not have the time or resources to dedicate to alternate systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are more labor-intensive and provide no greater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accountability than systems currently described for use by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, since there has been little interest expressed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distributing agencies in using alternate value pass-through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems, the Department does not believe it would be practical to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
develop specific guidelines for use in evaluating such systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Historically, there have only been three requests to use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternate systems. While two of these systems were approved for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use in the State processing program, only one is currently in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use. Instead, the Department finds that it is more effective to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluate all requests to use alternate system value pass-through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems on a case-by-case basis, making sure that, at a minimum, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the alternate system under consideration complies with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verification requirements contained in section 250.19(b)(2) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Food Distribution Program regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule adopts section 250.30(d)(1)(iii) of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State processing regulations and section 252.4(c)(4)(iii) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NCP regulations without change.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would eliminate the requirement under sections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
250.30(d)(2) and 250.30(e)(2) of the State processing regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and section 252.4(c)(4) of the NCP regulations that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor/distributor invoices must indicate the amount of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discount included or refund due the recipient agencies for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
end products purchased, regardless of the type of value pass-through system used. Sections 250.30.(d)(3) and 250.30(e)(2)
of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed rule would also require processors to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pricing information summaries to contracting agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contracting agencies would be required to provide these pricing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information summaries to recipient agencies as soon as possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after contract approval by the distributing agency. If any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pricing information changed during the contract year, processors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be required to provide updated pricing information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
summaries to the contracting agencies 30 days prior to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective date. The contracting agencies, in turn, would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to provide the updated summaries to the recipient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies. Section 250.30(c)(4)(xvii) of the proposed State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing regulations would create the affirmative duty of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor to provide these pricing summaries and updated pricing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
summaries. Under the NCP program, section 252.4(c)(4) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule would require processors to provide pricing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information summaries directly to the recipient agencies as soon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as possible after FCS contract approval. Also, section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
252.4(c)(4) of the proposed rule would require that if any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pricing information changes during the contract year, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor must provide updated pricing information summaries to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FCS and the recipient agencies 30 days prior to the effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date of such change.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Eight commenters were in favor of eliminating the requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the processor ensure that invoices clearly show the discount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included or refund due to the recipient agencies for the end 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product purchased. Commenters provided two main reasons for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wishing to eliminate this requirement: 1) it has proved very 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difficult to require distributors to identify refunds due or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discounts given on the invoices and 2) the requirement had become 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
somewhat obsolete because FCS policy currently allows 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors/distributors to provide pricing summaries to recipient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies in lieu of providing the pricing information on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
invoices. Five commenters were opposed to the proposal and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicated that they wanted to retain the pricing information on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the invoices because the invoice is the best place to alert 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipient agencies that a refund is due or a discount has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
given. One commenter added that many processors who utilize the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refund system provide a pre-printed rebate application which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lists the commodity value for each end product. Two commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicated that the proposed rule would have little, if any, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect on their operations. Only one comment was received on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes proposed for the NCP Program. That commenter endorsed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed provisions in section 252.4(c)(4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the past, several processors and distributors have expressed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concern to FCS about the added cost of redesigning and reprinting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
invoices in order to accommodate the requirement in the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations that the processor/distributor invoices clearly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicate the discount included or the refund due on end products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the growing concern, on May 2, 1989, FCS issued a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policy memorandum which allowed processors or distributors to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide recipient agencies a fact sheet, which clearly identified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the processed end products are made from commodities and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicates the amount of refund or discount due eligible recipient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies for such purchases. The Department believes it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate to incorporate this existing policy into the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule. These pricing information summaries need only consist of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information such as the product code, gross price, refund due or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discount given and net price. These summaries, as well as any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
updates to the summaries, must be prepared by processors and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
furnished to recipient agencies by either the processor or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distributing agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, this final rule adopts sections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
250.30(c)(4)(xvii), 250.30(d)(3) and 250.30(e)(2)of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 250.30(f)(1)(i), of the proposed rule would allow the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substitution of commercial food for those donated foods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically listed as substitutable in the current regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without requesting prior approval from the distributing agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, sections 250.30(f)(1)(iii), 250.30(f)(2), and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
250.30(f)(4) of the proposed State processing regulations include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the following provisions: 1) Processors may continue to request 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval from FCS to substitute other commercial foods (except 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meat and poultry), although without the requirement that requests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be made only when the distributing agency's inability to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintain the necessary inventory of donated food at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing plant would disrupt the production of end products and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in all cases in which a State processing contract permits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substitution, provided that processors must provide documentation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient to substantiate that they continue to acquire 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient substitutable commercial foods necessary to meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
100 percent yield requirement; 2) Distributing agencies can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withhold deliveries of donated food from processors which have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduced their level of commercial production because of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation in the State processing program; and 3)

contracts currently entered into by the processor. Sections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
252.3(c) and 252.4(c)(7) of the proposed rule would similarly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amend the NCP regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department received sixteen comments on this proposal. All 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters concurred that processors should not need written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval from the distributing agency to substitute those donated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foods listed as substitutable in the regulations with commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foods. However, two commenters stated that the Department should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider making all donated foods substitutable and one commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated that all donated food, except for meat and poultry, should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be considered as substitutable. Those commenters who favored a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
total or almost total substitution of all donated foods provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions under which substitution should be permitted: 1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USDA's Food Safety Inspection Service inspectors and/or USDA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agricultural Marketing Service graders verify that the commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
food being substituted is of equal or better quality and is of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the same generic identity as the donated food; 2) the processor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must provide the specifications of the commercial food used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substitute for donated food, along with a certification that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substituted foods are of equal or better quality; and 3) the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor must report all substitution on the monthly performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report to the distributing agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three comments were received in response to the proposal which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would permit distributing agencies to withhold deliveries of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
donated food from processors who have reduced their level of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial production because of participation in the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing program. These commenters made it clear that they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe distributing agencies do not have access to a processor's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records on the production of commercial end products in order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine whether withholding donated food is appropriate. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor expressed concern that the documentation necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantiate that the processor acquires sufficient amounts of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substitutable donated food would increase the overall workload of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the distributing agency staff.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department supports the commenters who recommended that all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
donated foods currently listed in the regulations be considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as substitutable with commercial foods without prior approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the distributing agency. However, the Department does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agree that all donated foods should be considered as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substitutable. The Department purchases high quality products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which must meet strict specifications for recipient agencies to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use in their meal service operations. Because the quality of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-listed donated foods, especially meat and poultry, can vary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tremendously, which will ultimately affect the quality of the end 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product, the Department believes it is necessary to eliminate any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possibility that inferior commercial product could be substituted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the high quality donated foods provided by USDA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the argument that Federal inspectors or graders 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could ensure the quality of any commercial product being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substituted for donated food is not reasonable. Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspectors or graders are only present in processing plants that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
convert donated meat or poultry into finished end products; they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are not required to be on-site in bakeries or processing plants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which only handle fruits, vegetables and/or grains. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional costs for obtaining the services of inspectors or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
graders to perform these services would be extremely high. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, based on the comments received, it is apparent that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters do not favor requiring distributing agencies to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitor the level of the processors's commercial production so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they would be permitted to withhold deliveries of donated food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from processors which have reduced their level of commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production because of participation in the State processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule adopts sections 250.30(f)(1)(i) and 250.30(f)(4) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the proposed State processing regulations without change. To 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alleviate the commenters' concerns, but to maintain the necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program accountability, section 250.30(f)(1)(iii) of this final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule will require the processor to be responsible for maintaining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documentation that normal commercial production has not been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduced as the result of participation in the processing program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To conform to the change in section 250.30(f)(1)(iii), this final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule also adds a new paragraph to section 250.30(c)(4)(xviii) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this final rule. This final rule adopts section 250.30(f)(2) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed State processing regulations as proposed with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minor modification for clarification. Additionally, this final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule adopts sections 252.3(c) and 252.4(c)(7) of the proposed NCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations without change.

Time Frames for Processors to Pay Refunds

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 250.30(k)(3) of the proposed State processing regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would require processors to make refund payments to recipient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies within 30 days after receipt of any refund application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, sections 250.30(k)(1) and 252.4(c)(4)(i)(B) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule would also permit recipient agencies to file refund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications on a Federal fiscal quarterly basis, if the total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anticipated refund due for all purchases from that processor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the quarter is 25 dollars or less. Furthermore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors would be permitted to group together refund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications for a single recipient agency on a Federal fiscal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis if the total anticipated refund due that recipient agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the quarter is 25 dollars or less. These quarterly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
options of batching of refund applications and refund payments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would only be permitted between a recipient agency and a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor, not between a distributor and a processor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A total of 16 comments was received on this proposal. Regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 30-day time frame for processors to pay refunds, twelve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters stated that they agreed with this concept and three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters were opposed. Many of those commenters that supported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 30-day time frame did so for the following reasons: 1) a 30-day time frame is more realistic and logical than the
10-day time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frame; 2) a 30-day time frame conforms to time frames used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
normal business practices; 3) a 10-day time frame is very 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difficult to meet because of limited staff resources; and 4) a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30-day time frame is reasonable because a refund payment will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
usually be received by the recipient agency before the recipient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency's payment for the end products reaches the processor. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three commenters who expressed opposition to the 30-day time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frame stated that it allows the processor to use school food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority money for an excessive period of time. One processor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also stated that the current 10-day time frame is more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate because it is the key to acceptance of the refund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system by recipient agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fourteen comments were received regarding quarterly batching of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refund applications by recipient agencies and twelve comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were received on quarterly batching of refund payments by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors. While all comments received on the concept of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quarterly batching were favorable, three commenters made the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following suggestions: 1) the threshold should be increased from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
25 dollars to 100 dollars; 2) there should be no minimum dollar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threshold associated with quarterly submission of refund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications by recipient agencies; 3) recipient agencies should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have an option to file refund applications monthly or quarterly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and processors must provide refunds within 30 days of receipt of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the refund application; and 4) to accommodate extenuating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances, distributing agencies should permit recipient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies to submit refund applications and processors to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refund payments outside of the quarterly time frames. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the comments received and the reasons set forth above, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this final rule adopts sections 250.30(k)(1) and 250.30(k)(3) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed State processing and section 252.4(c)(4)(i)(B) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed NCP regulations without change.

Section 250.30(k)(1) of the proposed State processing regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would eliminate the requirement that recipient agencies must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forward copies of the refund applications to distributing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies at the same time they submit the refund applications to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processor. Section 250.30(m)(1) of the proposed rule would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also amend the State processing regulations to add the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements: 1) that monthly performance reports be postmarked 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no later than the final day of the month following the reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period and the final performance report for the contract period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be postmarked no later than 60 days from the close of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contract year; and 2) that performance reports must be submitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monthly unless a processor made no sales and had no inventory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during that month. Finally, section 250.17 of the proposed State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing regulations would provide that where performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports are electronically transmitted to the distributing agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by means of a facsimile machine, the date printed by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facsimile machine on the facsimile copy may serve as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
postmark. The Department received seventeen comments on this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section of the proposed rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ten comments were received on eliminating the requirement that recipient agencies submit copies of the refund applications
to the distributing agencies. All commenters were in favor of the proposal, stating that the elimination of this dual
reporting requirement would reduce the paperwork burden. Since section 250.30(k)(3) of the current State processing
regulations also requires processors to send copies of the refund applications and refund payments to the distributing
agency as part of the monthly performance report, the requirement for recipient agencies to also send the refund applications
to the distributing agencies was viewed as duplicative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ten comments were received regarding the use of the postmark date to track the timing for submission of the monthly
performance reports. Nine commenters were in favor of the proposed change and one opposed. Those in favor stated that
by placing this requirement in the regulations, any uncertainties about the required time frames for submission
of the performance reports would be clarified. The one commenter opposed to this provision stated that upon receipt,
each performance report is stamp-dated when received and that the envelope containing the postmark is discarded,
because it is not practical to keep mailing envelopes on file. The Department wishes to clarify that the intent of this
requirement was not for distributing agencies to maintain mailing envelopes. Rather, distributing agencies should
record the postmark date that is on the mailing envelope and determine whether the performance report has been submitted
within the required time frame. All comments received on the proposal that the date printed on a report transmitted
by facsimile machine may serve as the postmark date were favorable; however, one commenter questioned whether it
is necessary to include such a policy in regulations. The Department believes that it is important to state within
the regulations that the date printed by the facsimile machine may serve as the postmark date, since this method of
submitting performance reports is becoming more commonplace. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters were generally opposed to the proposed requirement that processors would not have to submit performance
reports for those months in which no sales were made and where processors had no inventory. Fifteen comments were received
on this provision. Four commenters were in complete agreement, one commenter was in favor but with restrictions,
and ten commenters opposed. Those in complete agreement with the proposal did not provide further explanation for
their support. However, the one commenter in partial agreement with the proposal recommended that the requirement
be eliminated when processors have no inventory 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
no sales activity, but stipulated that upon arrival of any inventory or initiation of any approved sales from that
period on, monthly performance reports be required. Those commenters who wished to require monthly performance
reports for each month the processing contract is in effect provided the following reasons: (1) Distributing agencies
often do not know if a processor has inventory or has made any sales during the month until the monthly report is received;
(2) it would be difficult to know if a report was required, if a report was submitted but lost in the mail, if the processor
forgot to submit the report, or if the processor purposely did not send the report; (3) distributing agencies may not
know the status of a processor's inventory because incoming direct shipments of donated food may not arrive when anticipated
or product can be backhauled without the distributing agency's knowledge; (4) monthly reports must be maintained
to establish an audit trail; (5) auditable records should run consecutively without breaks in months; and (6) if the
Department eliminates the annual reconciliation report, distributing agencies, FCS and auditors must have the
monthly performance reports for each month the processing agreement is in effect in order to verify all activities
that occurred during the agreement period. One commenter added that processors should always have sales activity
each month because the current processing regulations discourage processors from entering into agreements if their
activity will be limited. The Department finds the commenters' arguments persuasive that monthly performance reports
be required for each month that the processing agreement is in effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the comments received and the above reasons, this final rule adopts sections 250.17(f), 250.30(k)(1) and
250.30(m)(1) of the proposed State processing regulations without change, except that the proposal in section 250.30(m)(1)
that processors would not be required to submit performance reports for those months in which no sales were made and
where processors had no inventory is not included in this final rule.

As part of the performance report requirements under section 250.30(m) of the current State processing regulations,
processors are required to submit to the distributing agency a list of all contracting agencies and their locations
with which the processor has processing contracts. Because the Department believes that requiring this list every
month is unnecessary and duplicative, the proposed rule would eliminate this list.

Additionally, in order to ensure that sales are only made to eligible recipient agencies with approved processing
contracts, &sect;250.30(c)(4)(xv) of the current regulations requires that as part of the processing contract,
the contracting agency must provide the processor with a list of all recipient agencies eligible to purchase end products
under the contract. However, the current rule implies, but does not explicitly require, the contracting agency to
provide updates to the list of recipient agencies for any changes that occur during the contract period. Therefore,
to clarify the regulation, &sect;250.30(c)(4)(xv) of the proposed rule would require the contracting agency to
provide updates to the list of recipient agencies for any changes which occur during the contract period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sixteen comments were received on these two proposals, all in favor of the provisions as proposed. Accordingly, this
final rule adopts &sect;&sect;250.30(c)(4)(xv) and 250.30(m) of the proposed State processing regulations without
change.

Quarterly Processing Activity Reports and Annual Reconciliation Reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule provided for major revisions in the areas of quarterly inventory reports, the annual reconciliation
report and the monthly performance reports. Sections 250.30(m)(1), 250.30(n) (3) and (4), and 250.30(o)(1) proposed
to amend the State processing regulations as follows: 1) the quarterly inventory reports and the annual reconciliation
report would be replaced with the monthly performance reports with year-to-date totals; 2) distributing agencies
would be required to forward to the FCS Regional Office the monthly performance report with year-to-date totals provided
by the processor for the last month of each Federal fiscal quarter; 3) when forwarding these monthly performance reports,
they would be required to be postmarked no later than 60 days following the close of each Federal fiscal quarter, except
that such reports must be postmarked no later than 90 days following the close of the contract period; 4) when a processor
submitted no monthly performance report for the last month of a Federal fiscal quarter, distributing agencies would
be required to submit to the FCS Regional Office the last monthly performance report received from the processor for
that Federal fiscal quarter; 5) the last monthly performance report for the contract period would serve as the annual
reconciliation report; 6) distributing agencies would be required to certify the accuracy of the information contained
in the final performance report; and 7) when a processor submitted no monthly performance report for the last month
of the contract period, the last monthly performance report received from the processor would serve as the annual
reconciliation report and this final performance report would be required to be postmarked no later than 90 days following
the close of the contract period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seventeen comments were received on the above provisions contained in the proposed rule. Regarding the replacement
of the quarterly inventory reports with the monthly performance reports, seven comments were received, four in favor
and three opposed. However, based on comments received, it appears that some commenters may have misunderstood the
purpose for replacing the quarterly inventory reports with the monthly performance reports with year-to-date totals.
Under the current regulations, performance reports are required to contain inventory information on a monthly basis,
but not on a quarterly basis. Distributing agencies are required to extract inventory information from the performance
reports and compile this information on a quarterly basis for submission to the FCS Regional Office. Requiring that
performance reports have year-to-date totals of inventory information would eliminate the need for distributing
agency staff to prepare a quarterly inventory report. This reduces the workload of the distributing agency staff
and only requires a small change in the processor's performance report format. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, it was not the intent of the Department that distributing agencies photocopy the entire content of the
performance report for submission to the FCS Regional Office. While sales activity for the month usually comprises
the major part of the performance report, processors typically show inventory activity on a separate page of the monthly
performance report. On the inventory summary portion of the performance report, all sales are represented by a single
inventory drawdown figure which represents the cumulative total of all individual sales reported for the month.
The intent of the proposed rule was for distributing agencies to send the inventory summary portion of the December,
March and June performance reports that contains the inventory information (i.e., beginning inventory, receipts
for the month, transfers in and out, inventory drawdown, and ending inventory balance with year-to-date totals)
to the FCS Regional Offices, and not the entire performance report.

Twelve commenters were in favor of replacing the annual reconciliation report with the last monthly performance
report with year-to-date totals, and two commenters were opposed. Those in favor stated that this proposal is a positive
step toward reducing paperwork, while those opposed stated it would increase paperwork because distributing agencies
would be required to certify the accuracy of the performance reports. In its review of this proposal and the comments
received, the Department believes this proposal will serve to reduce paperwork. Under the current regulations for
annual reconciliation, processors must total donated food receipts, transfer information, sales activity, and
ending inventory balance from the individual performance reports. Under the proposed rule, it would not be necessary
for processors to go through previous performance reports and compute these figures, since this information will
be tallied cumulatively each month. Additionally, submitting performance reports with year-to-date totals will
eliminate the need for distributing agencies to compile data from the individual quarterly reports to ensure that
the annual reconciliation report figures are accurate. The final performance report for the contract year, including
a summary sheet of year-to-date inventory totals, will replace the annual reconciliation report formerly required
in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter expressed concern that the time frames for submitting the performance reports with year-to-date totals
to FCS are the same time frames currently required for submission of the quarterly inventory reports. That commenter
indicated that if there were errors in the report, there would not be sufficient time for the processor to make the corrections
and return the report to the distributing agency in order for the distributing agency to submit it to the FCS Regional
Office on time. The Department believes that since most performance reports are computer-generated, and the calculation
of the year-to-date totals would be performed by a formula placed into the computer program, there would be very few
errors made. Furthermore, the Department believes that it is better to handle any errors that might be discovered
on performance reports on a case-by-case basis. Distributing agencies will be required to certify that the inventory
information contained in the final performance report is accurate, just as they are required to do under section 250.30(n)(4)
of the current rule for the annual reconciliation report. The time frames for submission of the performance reports,
as discussed earlier in this preamble, will remain the same as in the proposed rule and are clearly spelled out in the
final rule under section 250.30(m)(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed earlier in this preamble under Refund Applications/Performance Reports, section 250.30(m)(1) of
the proposed rule stated that processors are not required to submit performance reports for those months in which
no sales were made and those months where processors had no inventory. As previously discussed, this provision is
not included in the final rule. Therefore, the provisions in sections 250.30(n)(3) and 250.30(o)(1) of the proposed
State processing regulation, which would provide that when a processor does not submit a monthly performance or inventory
report for the last month of a Federal fiscal quarter, the distributing agency must forward to the FCS Regional Office
the last monthly performance report received from the processor for that quarter, are not included in this final rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule adopts sections 250.30(m)(1), 250.30(n) (3) and (4), and 250.30(o)(1) of the proposed State processing
regulations without change, except as previously noted. FCS plans to develop a prototype performance report format
which will be easily adaptable for processors to incorporate into existing inventory reporting programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This section of the proposed rule did not affect the NCP Program.

requirements specified in &sect;250.19(b) of this part, or an alternative verification system approved by FCS.
The Department retains the authority to inspect and review all pertinent records including records pertaining to
the verification of a statistically valid sample of sales. FCS may consider the paperwork and resource burden associated
with alternative value pass-through systems when considering approval and reserves the right to deny the approval

in accordance with paragraph (k) of this section and the price of each unit of end product purchased by eligible recipient
agencies through a distributor shall be discounted by the contract value of the donated foods contained therein;
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) An alternative value pass-through system under which the contract value of the donated food contained in each

agency for the storage and delivery of the end products; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The processor arranges for the delivery of end products through a distributor on behalf of the recipient agency.
In this system, the processor's invoice must include both the fee-for-service and the distributor's charges as separate,
clearly identifiable charges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Processors shall provide pricing information summaries to contracting agencies and contracting agencies shall
provide this information to recipient agencies as soon as possible after contract approval. If this pricing information
changes during the contract period, the processor shall provide updated pricing information to the contracting
agency, which, in turn, shall provide this information to the eligible recipient agencies.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipient agency shall submit a refund application to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor within 30 days of receipt of the processed end product,

within 30 days of receipt of the refund application from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipient agency, an amount equal to the established agreement

Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) When the processor seeks FCS approval to substitute donated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonfat dry milk with concentrated skim milk under paragraph (c)(7)(i)(A) of this section, an addendum must be added
to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request which states: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The percent of milk solids that, at a minimum, must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contained in the concentrated skim milk; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The weight ratio of concentrated skim milk to donated nonfat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dry milk: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) The weight ratio is the weight of concentrated skim milk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which equals one pound of donated nonfat dry milk, based on milk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solids; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) In calculating this weight, nonfat dry milk shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered as containing 96.5 percent milk solids; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) If more than one concentration of concentrated skim milk is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be used, a separate weight ratio must be specified for each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The processor's method of verifying that the milk solids 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
content in the concentrated skim milk is as stated in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) A requirement that the concentrated skim milk shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produced in a USDA approved plant or in a plant approved by an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate regulatory authority for the processing of Grade A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
milk products; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) A requirement that the contact value of donated food for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
given amount of concentrated skim milk used to produce an end 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product is the value of the equivalent amount of donated nonfat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dry milk, based on the weight ratio of the two foods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Substitution must not be made solely for the purpose of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selling or disposing of the donated commodity in commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
channels for profit.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) is amending its risk-based capital guidelines to recognize
the risk-reducing benefits of qualifying bilateral netting contracts. This final rule implements a recent revision
to the Basle Accord permitting the recognition of such netting arrangements. The effect of the final rule is that state
member banks and bank holding companies (banking organizations, institutions) may net positive and negative mark-to-market
values of interest and exchange rate contracts in determining the current exposure portion of the credit equivalent
amount of such contracts to be included in risk-weighted assets.

The Basle Accord
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 established a risk-based capital framework which was implemented for state member banks and bank holding companies
by the Board in 1989. Under this framework, off-balance-sheet interest rate and exchange rate contracts (rate contracts)
are incorporated into risk weighted assets by converting each contract into a credit equivalent amount. This amount
is then assigned to the appropriate credit risk category according to the identity of the obligor or counterparty
or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of the collateral. The credit equivalent amount of an interest or exchange
rate contract can be assigned to a maximum credit risk category of 50 percent.

The Basle Accord is a risk-based framework that was proposed by the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision (Basle
Supervisors' Committee) and endorsed by the central bank governors of the Group of Ten (G&hyph;10) countries in July
1988. The Basle Supervisors' Committee is comprised of representatives of the central banks and supervisory authorities
from the G&hyph;10 countries (Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland,
the United Kingdom, and the United States) and Luxembourg. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The credit equivalent amount of a rate contract is determined by adding together the current replacement cost (current
exposure) and an estimate of the possible increase in future replacement cost in view of the volatility of the current
exposure over the remaining life of the contract (potential future exposure, also referred to as the add-on).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
This method of determining credit equivalent amounts for rate contracts is identified in the Basle Accord as the current
exposure method, which is used by most international banks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For risk-based capital purposes, a rate contract with a positive mark-to-market value has a current exposure equal
to that market value. If the mark-to-market value of a rate contract is zero or negative, then there is no replacement
cost associated with the contract and the current exposure is zero. The original Basle Accord and the Board's guidelines
provided that current exposure would be determined individually for each rate contract entered into by a banking
organization; institutions generally were not permitted to offset, that is, net, positive and negative market values
of multiple rate contracts with a single counterparty to determine one current credit exposure relative to that counterparty.

It was noted in the Accord that the legal enforceability of certain netting arrangements was unclear in some jurisdictions.
The legal status of netting by novation, however, was determined to be settled and this limited type of netting was
recognized. Netting by novation is accomplished under a written bilateral contract providing that any obligation
to deliver a given currency on a given date is automatically amalgamated with all other obligations for the same currency
and value date. The previously existing contracts are extinguished and a new contract for the single net amount, in
effect, legally replaces the amalgamated gross obligations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In April 1993 the Basle Supervisors' Committee proposed a revision to the Basle Accord, endorsed by the G&hyph;10
Governors in July 1994, that permits institutions to net positive and negative market values of rate contracts subject
to a qualifying, legally enforceable, bilateral netting arrangement. Under the revision, institutions with a qualifying
netting arrangement may calculate a single net current exposure for purposes of determining the credit equivalent
amount for the included contracts.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the net market value of the contracts included in such a netting arrangement is positive, then that market value
equals the current exposure for the netting contract. If the net market value is zero or negative, then the current
exposure is zero.

The revision to the Accord notes that national supervisors must be satisfied about the legal enforceability of a netting
arrangement under the laws of each jurisdiction relevant to the arrangement. The Accord also states that, if any supervisor
is dissatisfied about enforceability under its own laws, the netting arrangement does not satisfy this condition
and neither counterparty may obtain supervisory benefit.

The Board's Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 20, 1994, the Board and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issued a joint proposal to amend their
respective risk-based capital standards (59 FR 26456) in accordance with the Basle Supervisors' Committee's April
1993 proposal.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The joint proposal provided that for capital purposes institutions regulated by the Board and the OCC could net the
positive and negative market values of interest and exchange rate contracts subject to a qualifying, legally enforceable,
bilateral netting contract to calculate one current exposure for that netting contract (sometimes referred to as
the master netting contract).

Corporation (FDIC) issued its netting proposal on July 25, 1994.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal provided that the net current exposure would be determined by adding together all positive and negative
market values of individual contracts subject to the netting contract. The net current exposure would equal the sum
of the market values if that sum is a positive value, or zero if the sum of the market values is zero or a negative value.
The proposals did not alter the calculation method for potential future exposure.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Potential future exposure is estimated by multiplying the effective notional amount of a contract by a credit conversion
factor which is based on the type of contract and the remaining maturity of the contract. Under the Board/OCC proposal,
a potential future exposure amount would be calculated for each individual contract subject to the netting contract.
The individual potential future exposures would then be added together to arrive at one total add-on amount.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposal, institutions would be able to net for risk-based capital purposes only with a written bilateral
netting contract that creates a single legal obligation covering all included individual rate contracts and does
not contain a walkaway clause.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 The proposal required an institution to obtain a written and reasoned legal opinion(s) stating that under the master
netting contract the institution would have a claim to receive, or an obligation to pay, only the net amount of the sum
of the positive and negative market values of included individual contracts if a counterparty failed to perform due
to default, insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar circumstances.

A walkaway clause is a provision in a netting contract that permits a non-defaulting counterparty to make lower payments
than it would make otherwise under the contract, or no payment at all, to a defaulter or to the estate of a defaulter,
even if the defaulter or the estate of the defaulter is a net creditor under the contract.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal indicated that the legal opinion must normally cover: (i) The law of the jurisdiction in which the counterparty
is chartered, or the equivalent location in the case of noncorporate entities, and if a branch of the counterparty
is involved, the law of the jurisdiction in which the branch is located; (ii) the law that governs the individual contracts
covered by the netting contract; and (iii) the law that governs the netting contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal provided that an institution must maintain in its files documentation adequate to support the bilateral
netting contract. Documentation would typically include a copy of the bilateral netting contract, legal opinions
and any related translations. In addition, the proposal required an institution to establish and maintain procedures
to ensure that the legal characteristics of netting contracts would be kept under review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposal, the Federal Reserve could disqualify any or all contracts from netting treatment for risk-based
capital purposes if the requirements of the proposal were not satisfied. In the event of disqualification, the affected
contracts would be treated as though they were not subject to the master netting contract. The proposal indicated
that outstanding netting by novation arrangements would not be grandfathered, that is, such arrangements would
have to meet all of the proposed requirements for qualifying bilateral netting contracts.

The Board received nineteen public comments on the proposed amendment. Eleven comments were from banking organizations
and five were from industry trade associations and organizations. In addition, there were three comments from law
firms. All commenters supported the expanded recognition of bilateral netting contracts for risk-based capital
purposes. Several commenters encouraged recognition of such contracts as quickly as possible. Many of the commenters
concurred with one of the principal underlying tenets of the proposal, that is, that legally enforceable bilateral
netting contracts can provide an efficient and desirable means for institutions to reduce or control credit exposure.
A few commenters noted that, in their view, the recognition of bilateral netting contracts would create an incentive
for market participants to use such arrangements and would encourage lawmakers to clarify the legal status of netting
arrangements in their jurisdictions. One commenter noted that the expanded recognition of bilateral netting contracts
would help keep U.S. banking organizations competitive in global derivatives markets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While generally expressing their endorsement for the expanded recognition of bilateral netting contracts, nearly
all commenters offered suggestions or requested clarification regarding details of the proposals. In particular,
the commenters raised issues concerning specifics of the required legal opinions, the treatment of collateral,
and the grandfathering of walkaway clauses and novation agreements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Almost all commenters addressed the proposed requirement that institutions obtain legal opinions concluding that
their bilateral netting contracts would be enforceable in all relevant jurisdictions. Commenters did not object
to the general requirement that they secure legal opinions, rather they raised a number of questions about the form
and substance of an acceptable opinion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Form. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters requested clarification as to the specific form of the legal opinion. Commenters wanted to know
if a memorandum of law would satisfy the requirement or if a legal 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
opinion
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would be required. They questioned whether a memorandum or opinion could be addressed to, or obtained by, an industry
group, and whether a generic opinion or memorandum relating to a standardized netting contract would satisfy the
legal opinion requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters suggested that an opinion secured on behalf of the banking industry by an organization should
be sufficient so long as the individual institution's counsel concurs with the opinion and concludes that the opinion
applies directly to the institution's specific netting contract and to the individual contracts subject to it. A
few commenters requested confirmation that legal opinions would not have to follow a predetermined format. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Scope. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters identified two possible interpretations of the proposed language with regard to the scope of
the legal opinions. They asked for clarification as to whether the opinions would be required to discuss only whether
all relevant jurisdictions would recognize the contractual choice of law, or whether they must also discuss the enforceability
of netting in bankruptcy or other instances of default. One commenter suggested deleting the requirement for a choice
of law analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters objected to the proposed requirement that the legal opinion for a multibranch netting contract
(that is, a netting contract between multinational banks that includes contracts with branches of the parties located
in various jurisdictions) address the enforceability of netting under the law of the jurisdiction where each branch
is located. These commenters stated that it should be sufficient for the legal opinion to conclude that netting would
be enforced in the jurisdiction of the counterparty's home office if the master netting contract provides that all
transactions are considered obligations of the home office and the branch jurisdictions recognize that provision.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Severability. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters expressed concern about the proposed treatment for netting contracts that include contracts
with branches in jurisdictions where the enforceability of netting is unclear. In such circumstances, commenters
asserted, unenforceability or uncertainty in one jurisdiction should not invalidate the entire netting contract
for risk-based capital netting treatment. These commenters contended that contracts with branches of a counterparty
in jurisdictions that recognize netting arrangements should be netted and contracts with branches in jurisdictions
where the enforceability of netting is not supported by legal opinions should, for risk-based capital purposes,
be severed, or removed from the master netting contract and treated as though they were not subject to that contract.
These commenters noted that this treatment should only be available to the extent it is supported by legal opinion.

Conclusions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal required a legal opinion to conclude that ``relevant court and administrative authorities would find''
the netting to be effective. Many commenters that discussed this aspect of the proposal expressed concern that this
standard was too high. They suggested, instead, that the opinions be required to conclude that netting ``should''
be effective.

A few commenters requested clarification regarding the proposed requirement that the netting contract must create
a single legal obligation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Collateral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Twelve commenters addressed the proposal's specific request for comment on the nature of collateral and the extent
to which collateral might be recognized in conjunction with bilateral netting contracts. All of these commenters
believed collateral should be recognized as a means of reducing credit exposure. A few commenters noted that collateral
arrangements are increasingly being used with derivative transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters stated that for netting contracts that call for the use of collateral, the amount of required collateral
is determined from the net mark-to-market value of the master netting contract. A few commenters added that mark-to-market
collateral often is used in conjunction with a collateral ``add-on'' based on such things as the notional amount of
the underlying contracts, the maturities of the contracts, the credit quality of the counterparty, and volatility
levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters offered their opinions as to how collateral should be recognized for risk-based capital purposes.
Some suggested that the existing method of recognizing collateral for purposes of assigning credit equivalent amounts
to risk categories is applicable to derivative transactions as well. Other commenters expressed the view that collateral
should be recognized when assigning risk weights to the extent it is legally available to cover the total credit exposure
for the bilateral netting contract in the event of default and that this availability should be addressed in the legal
opinions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several other commenters suggested separating the net current exposure and potential future exposure of bilateral
netting contracts for determining collateral coverage and appropriate risk weights. One commenter favored recognizing
collateral for capital purposes by allowing an institution to offset net current exposure by the amount of the collateral
to further reduce the credit equivalent amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters requested clarification that contracts subject to qualifying netting contracts could be eligible
for a zero percent risk weight if the transaction is properly collateralized in accordance with the Board's collateralized
transactions rule.

In December 1992 the Board issued an amendment to its risk-based capital guidelines permitting certain collateralized
transactions to qualify for a zero percent risk weight (57 FR 62180, December 30, 1992). In order to qualify for a zero
percent risk weight, an institution must maintain a positive margin of qualifying collateral at all times. Thus,
the collateral arrangement should provide for immediate liquidation of the claim in the event that a positive margin
of collateral is not maintained. The OCC has issued a similar proposal (58 FR 43822, August 18, 1993).

Walkaway Clauses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters addressed the proposed prohibition against walkaway clauses in contracts qualifying for netting
for risk-based capital purposes. While most of these commenters agreed that, ultimately, walkaway clauses should
be eliminated from master netting contracts, they favored a phase-out period, during which outstanding bilateral
netting contracts containing walkaway clauses could qualify for capital netting treatment. Several commenters
contended that if a defaulter is a net debtor under the contract, the existence of a walkaway clause would not affect
the amount owed to the non-defaulting creditor.

One commenter requested greater detail on the nature and extent of examination review procedures. Two commenters
stated that in some situations obtaining translations might be burdensome. Another commenter suggested assurance
that the Federal Reserve would not disqualify netting contracts in an unreasonable manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approximately one-half of the commenters expressed concern that the proposal specifically was limited to interest
rate and exchange rate contracts. All of these opposed limiting the range of products that could be included under
qualifying netting contracts. In this regard, one commenter noted that where there is sufficient legal support confirming
the enforceability of cross-product netting, such netting should be recognized for capital purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters used the proposal as an opportunity to discuss the manner in which the add-on for potential future
exposure is calculated. They suggested netting contracts should be recognized not only as a way to reduce the current
exposure to a counterparty, but also the effects of such netting contracts should be taken into account to reduce the
amount of capital organizations must hold against the potential future exposure to the counterparty.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After considering the public comments received and further deliberating the issues involved, the Board is adopting
a final rule recognizing, for capital purposes, qualifying bilateral netting contracts. This final rule is substantially
the same as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Legal Opinions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Form. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule requires that institutions obtain a written and reasoned legal opinion(s) concluding that the netting
contract is enforceable in all relevant jurisdictions. This requirement is aimed at ensuring there is a substantial
legal basis supporting the legal enforceability of a netting contract before reducing a banking organization's
capital requirement based on that netting contract. A legal opinion, as generally recognized by the legal community
in the United States, can provide such a legal basis. A memorandum of law may be an acceptable alternative as long as
it addresses all of the relevant issues in a credible manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in the proposal, the legal opinions may be prepared by either an outside law firm or an institution's in-house
counsel. The salient requirements for an acceptable legal opinion are that it: (i) Addresses all relevant jurisdictions;
and (ii) concludes with a high degree of certainty that in the event of a legal challenge the banking organization's
claim or obligation would be determined by the relevant court or administrative authority to be the net sum of the positive
and negative mark-to-market values of all individual contracts subject to the bilateral netting contract. The subject
matter and complexity of required legal opinions will vary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To some extent, institutions may use general, standardized opinions to help support the legal enforceability of
their bilateral netting contracts. For example, a banking organization may have obtained a memorandum of law addressing
the enforceability of netting provisions in a particular foreign jurisdiction. This opinion may be used as the basis
for recognizing netting generally in that jurisdiction. However, with regard to an individual master netting contract,
the general opinion would need to be supplemented by an opinion that addresses issues such as the enforceability of
the underlying contracts, choice of law, and severability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, the Board does not believe that a generic opinion prepared for a trade association with respect to the
effectiveness of netting under the standard form agreement issued by the trade association, by itself, is adequate
to support a netting contract. Banking organizations using such general opinions would need to supplement them with
a review of the terms of the specific netting contract that the institution is executing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Scope. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With regard to the scope of the legal opinions, that is, what areas of analysis must be covered, the Board is of the opinion
that legal opinions must address the validity and enforceability of the entire netting contract. The opinion must
conclude that under the applicable state or other jurisdictional law the netting contract is a legal, valid, and binding
contract, enforceable in accordance with its terms, even in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or similar proceedings.
Opinions provided on the law of jurisdictions outside of the U.S. should include a discussion and conclusion that
netting provisions do not violate the public policy or the law of that jurisdiction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board has further determined that one of the most critical aspects of a qualifying netting contract is the contract's
enforceability in any jurisdiction whose law would likely be applied in an enforcement action, as well as the jurisdiction
where the counterparty's assets reside. In this regard, and in light of the policy in some countries to liquidate branches
of foreign banking organizations independent of the head office, the Board is retaining its proposed requirement
that legal opinions address the netting contract's enforceability under: (i) The law of the jurisdiction in which
the counterparty is chartered, or the equivalent location in the case of noncorporate entities, and if a branch of
the counterparty is involved, the law of the jurisdiction in which the branch is located; (ii) the law that governs
the individual contracts subject to the bilateral netting contract; and (iii) the law that governs the netting contract.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Severability. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board recognizes that for some multibranch netting contracts an organization may not be able to obtain a legal
opinion(s) concluding that netting would be enforceable in every jurisdiction where branches covered under the
master netting contract are located. The Board concurs with commenters that in such situations it may be inefficient
to require institutions to renegotiate netting contracts to ensure they cover only those jurisdictions where netting
is clearly enforceable. The Board has determined that, in certain circumstances for capital purposes, banking institutions
may use master bilateral netting contracts that include contracts with branches across all jurisdictions. Banking
institutions should calculate their net current exposure for the contracts in those jurisdictions where netting
clearly is enforceable as supported by legal opinion(s). The remaining contracts subject to the netting contract
should be severed from the netting contract and treated as though they were not subject to the netting contract for
capital and credit purposes. This approach of essentially dividing contracts subject to the netting contact into
two categories_those that clearly may be netted and those that may not_is acceptable provided that the banking organization's
legal opinions conclude that the contracts that do not qualify for netting treatment are legally severable from the
master netting contract and that such severance will not undermine the enforceability of the netting contract for
the remaining qualifying contracts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Conclusions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board has retained the proposed language that legal opinions must represent that netting would be enforceable
in all relevant jurisdictions. In response to commenters' assertions that the standard for this type of legal opinion
is too high, the Board notes that use of the word ``would'' in the capital rules does not necessarily mean that the legal
opinions must also use the word ``would'' or that enforceability must be determined to be an absolute certainty. The
intent, rather, is for banking organizations to secure a legal opinion concluding that there is a high degree of certainty
that the netting contract will survive a legal challenge in any applicable jurisdiction. The degree of certainty
should be apparent from the reasoning set out in the opinion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board notes that the requirement for legal opinions to conclude that netting contracts must create a single legal
obligation applies only to those individual contracts that are covered by, and included under, the netting contract
for capital purposes. As discussed above, a netting contract may include individual contracts that do not qualify
for netting treatment, provided that these individual contracts are legally severable from the contracts to be netted
for capital purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Institutions generally must include all contracts covered by a qualifying netting contract in calculating the current
exposure of that netting contract. In the event a netting contract covers transactions that are normally excluded
from the risk-based ratio calculation_for example, exchange rate contracts with an original maturity of fourteen
calendar days or less or instruments traded on exchanges that require daily payment of variation margin_an institution
may choose to either include or exclude all mark-to-market values of such contracts when determining net current
exposure, but this choice must be followed consistently.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Collateral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule permits, subject to certain conditions, institutions to take into account qualifying collateral
when assigning the credit equivalent amount of a netting contract to the appropriate risk weight category in accordance
with the procedures and requirements currently set forth in the Board's risk-based capital guidelines. The Board
has added language to the final rule clarifying that collateral must be legally available to cover the credit exposure
of the netting contract in the event of default. For example, the collateral may not be pledged solely against one individual
contract subject to the master netting contract. The legal availability of the collateral must be addressed in the
legal opinions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Walkaway Clauses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board has considered the suggestion made by some commenters of a phase-out period for outstanding contracts with
walkaway clauses. The Board continues to believe that walkaway clauses do not reduce credit risk. Accordingly, the
final rule retains the provision that bilateral netting contracts with walkaway clauses are not eligible for netting
treatment for risk-based capital purposes and does not provide for a phase-out period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Novation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal required all netting contracts, including netting by novation agreements, to be supported by written
legal opinions. The Board does not agree with commenters that a grandfathering period for outstanding novation agreements
is needed. Rather, the Board continues to believe that all netting contracts must be held to the same standards in order
to promote certainty as to the legal enforceability of the contracts and to decrease the risks faced by counterparties
in the event of default. Under the final rule, a netting by novation agreement must meet the requirements for a qualifying
bilateral netting contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Other Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board has considered all of the other issues raised by commenters. With regard to documentation, the Board reiterates
that, as with all provisions of risk-based capital, a banking organization must maintain in its files appropriate
documentation to support any particular capital treatment including netting of rate contracts. Appropriate documentation
typically would include a copy of the bilateral netting contract, supporting legal opinions, and any related translations.
The documentation should be available to examiners for their review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board recognizes commenters' concerns that the proposed rule was limited specifically to interest and exchange
rate contracts. The Board notes that both the Basle Accord and the Board's risk-based capital guidelines currently
do not address derivatives contracts other than rate contracts. This final rule does not attempt to go beyond the scope
of the existing risk-based capital framework and applies only to netting contracts encompassing interest rate and
foreign exchange rate contracts. The Board, however, notes that the Basle Supervisors' Committee issued a proposal
for public comment in July 1994 to amend the Basle Accord that explicitly would set forth the risk-based capital treatment
for other types of derivative transactions, such as commodity, precious metal, and equity contracts. In this regard,
the Board issued a similar proposal, based on the Basle Supervisors' Committee proposal, to amend its risk-based
capital guidelines (59 FR 43508, August 24, 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Until the Basle Accord has been revised and the Board's risk-based capital rules have been amended to encompass commodity,
precious metal, and equity derivative contracts, the Board, rather than automatically disqualifying from capital
netting treatment an entire netting contract that includes non-rate-related transactions, will permit institutions
to apply the following treatment. In determining the current exposure of otherwise qualifying netting contracts
that include non-rate-related contracts, institutions will be permitted to net the positive and negative mark-to-market
values of the included interest and exchange rate contracts, while severing the non-rate-related contracts and
treating them for risk-based capital purposes as individual contracts that are not subject to the master netting
contract. (This treatment is similar to the treatment applied to a netting contract that includes contracts in jurisdictions
where the enforceability of netting is not supported by legal opinion. With non-rate-related contracts, however,
legal opinions on severability are not required.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board notes that the regulatory language with regard to the calculation of potential future exposure remains
essentially the same as that proposed. The Board has clarified an underlying premise of the current exposure method
for calculating credit exposure as set forth in the Basle Accord, that is, the add-on for potential future exposure
must be calculated based on the effective, rather than the apparent, notional principal amount and the notional amount
an institution uses will be subject to examiner review.

The notional amount is, generally, a stated reference amount of money used to calculate payment streams between the
counterparties. In the event that the effect of the notional amount is leveraged or enhanced by the structure of the
transaction, institutions must use the actual, or effective, notional amount when determining potential future
exposure.

Paperwork Reduction Act and Regulatory Burden 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board has determined that this final rule will not increase the regulatory paperwork burden of banking organizations
pursuant to the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 302 of the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;325, 108
Stat. 2160) provides that the federal banking agencies must consider the administrative burdens and benefits of
any new regulation that imposes additional requirements on insured depository institutions. Section 302 also requires
such a rule to take effect on the first day of the calendar quarter following final publication of the rule, unless the
agency, for good cause, determines an earlier effective date is appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new capital rule imposes certain requirements on depository institutions that wish to net the current exposures
of their rate contracts for purposes of calculating their risk-based capital requirements. For these institutions,
any burden of complying with the requirements of netting under a legally enforceable netting contract and obtaining
the necessary legal opinions should be outweighed by the benefits associated with a lower capital requirement. The
new rule will not affect institutions that do not wish to net for capital purposes. For these reasons, the Board has
determined that an effective date of December 31, 1994 is appropriate, in order to allow banking organizations to
take advantage of netting in their year-end statements, if they so desire. For these same reasons, in accordance with
5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3) the Board finds there is good cause not to follow the 30-day notice requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553(d)
and to make the rule effective on December 31, 1994.

Calculation of credit equivalent amounts. a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The credit equivalent amount of an off-balance-sheet rate contract that is not subject to a qualifying bilateral
netting contract in accordance with section III.E.5. of this appendix A is equal to the sum of (i) the current exposure
(sometimes referred to as the replacement cost) of the contract; and (ii) an estimate of the potential future credit
exposure over the remaining life of the contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. The current exposure is determined by the mark-to-market value of the contract. If the mark-to-market value is
positive, then the current exposure is that mark-to-market value. If the mark-to-market value is zero or negative,
then the current exposure is zero. Mark-to-market values are measured in dollars, regardless of the currency or currencies
specified in the contract, and should reflect changes in the relevant rates, as well as counterparty credit quality.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. The potential future credit exposure of a contract, including a contract with a negative mark-to-market value,
is estimated by multiplying the notional principal amount of the contract by a credit conversion factor. Banks should,
subject to examiner review, use the effective rather than the apparent or stated notional amount in this calculation.
The conversion factors are:

d. Examples of the calculation of credit equivalent amounts for these instruments are contained in Attachment V of
this appendix A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. Because exchange rate contracts involve an exchange of principal upon maturity, and exchange rates are generally
more volatile than interest rates, higher conversion factors have been established for foreign exchange rate contracts
than for interest rate contracts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. No potential future credit exposure is calculated for single currency interest rate swaps in which payments are
made based upon two floating rate indices, so-called floating/floating or basis swaps; the credit exposure on these
contracts is evaluated solely on the basis of their mark-to-market values.

For interest and exchange rate contracts, sufficiency of collateral or guarantees is determined by the market value
of the collateral or the amount of the guarantee in relation to the credit equivalent amount. Collateral and guarantees
are subject to the same provisions noted under section III.B. of this appendix A. Collateral held against a netting
contract is not recognized for capital purposes unless it is legally available to support the single legal obligation
created by the netting contract.

a. For purposes of this appendix A, netting refers to the offsetting of positive and negative mark-to-market values
in the determination of a current exposure to be used in the calculation of a credit equivalent amount. Any legally
enforceable form of bilateral netting (that is, netting with a single counterparty) of rate contracts is recognized
for purposes of calculating the credit equivalent amount provided that:

i. The netting is accomplished under a written netting contract that creates a single legal obligation, covering
all included individual contracts, with the effect that the bank would have a claim to receive, or obligation to pay,
only the net amount of the sum of the positive and negative mark-to-market values on included individual contracts
in the event that a counterparty, or a counterparty to whom the contract has been validly assigned, fails to perform
due to any of the following events: Default, insolvency, liquidation, or similar circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 ii. The bank obtains a written and reasoned legal opinion(s) representing that in the event of a legal challenge_including
one resulting from default, insolvency, liquidation, or similar circumstances_the relevant court and administrative
authorities would find the bank's exposure to be such a net amount under:

A walkaway clause is a provision in a netting contract that permits a non-defaulting counterparty to make lower payments
than it would make otherwise under the contract, or no payment at all, to a defaulter or to the estate of a defaulter,
even if the defaulter or the estate of the defaulter is a net creditor under the contract.

c. By netting individual contracts for the purpose of calculating its credit equivalent amount, a bank represents
that it has met the requirements of this appendix A and all the appropriate documents are in the bank's files and available
for inspection by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve may determine that a bank's files are inadequate or that
a netting contract, or any of its underlying individual contracts, may not be legally enforceable under any one of
the bodies of law described in paragraph 5.a.ii.

. of section III of this appendix A. If such a determination is made, the netting contract may be disqualified from recognition
for risk-based capital purposes or underlying individual contracts may be treated as though they are not subject
to the netting contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 d. The credit equivalent amount of rate contracts that are subject to a qualifying bilateral netting contract is calculated
by adding (i) the current exposure of the netting contract, and (ii) the sum of the estimates of the potential future
credit exposures on all individual contracts subject to the netting contract, estimated in accordance with section
III.E.2. of this appendix A.

For purposes of calculating potential future credit exposure to a netting counterparty for foreign exchange contracts
and other similar contracts in which notional principal is equivalent to cash flows, total notional principal is
defined as the net receipts falling due on each value date in each currency. The reason for this is that offsetting contracts
in the same currency maturing on the same date will have lower potential future exposure as well as lower current exposure.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
e. The current exposure of the netting contract is determined by summing all positive and negative mark-to-market
values of the individual contracts included in the netting contract. If the net sum of the mark-to-market values is
positive, then the current exposure of the netting contract is equal to that sum. If the net sum of the mark-to-market
values is zero or negative, then the current exposure of the netting contract is zero. The Federal Reserve may determine
that a netting contract qualifies for risk-based capital netting treatment even though certain individual contracts
may not qualify. In such instances, the nonqualifying contracts should be treated as individual contracts that are
not subject to the netting contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 f. In the event a netting contract covers contracts that are normally excluded from the risk-based ratio calculation_for
example, exchange rate contracts with an original maturity of fourteen calendar days or less, or instruments traded
on exchanges that require daily payment of variation margin_an institution may elect to consistently either include
or exclude all mark-to-market values of such contracts when determining net current exposure.

contract is contained in Attachment V of this appendix A.

1. The credit equivalent amount of a rate contract is the sum of the current credit exposure of the contract and an estimate
of potential future increases in credit exposure. The current exposure is the positive mark-to-market value of the
contract (or zero if the mark-to-market value is zero or negative). For rate contracts that are subject to a qualifying
bilateral netting contract the current exposure is, generally, the net sum of the positive and negative mark-to-market
values of the contracts included in the netting contract (or zero if the net sum of the mark-to-market values is zero
or negative). The potential future exposure is calculated by multiplying the effective notional amount of a contract
by one of the following credit conversion factors, as appropriate:

2. No potential future exposure is calculated for single currency interest rate swaps in which payments are made based
upon two floating indices, that is, so called floating/floating or basis swaps. The credit exposure on these contracts
is evaluated solely on the basis of their mark-to-market value. Exchange rate contracts with an original maturity
of fourteen days or less are excluded. Instruments traded on exchanges that require daily payment of variation margin
are also excluded.

Calculation of credit equivalent amounts. a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The credit equivalent amount of an off-balance sheet rate contract that is not subject to a qualifying bilateral netting
contract in accordance with section III.E.5. of this appendix A is equal to the sum of (i) the current exposure (sometimes
referred to as the replacement cost) of the contract; and an (ii) estimate of the potential future credit exposure
over the remaining life of the contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. The current exposure is determined by the mark-to-market value of the contract. If the mark-to-market value is
positive, then the current exposure is that mark-to-market value. If the mark-to-market value is zero or negative,
then the current exposure is zero. Mark-to-market values are measured in dollars, regardless of the currency or currencies
specified in the contract, and should reflect changes in the relevant rates, as well as counterparty credit quality.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. The potential future credit exposure of a contract, including a contract with a negative mark-to-market value,
is estimated by multiplying the notional principal amount of the contract by a credit conversion factors. Banking
organizations should, subject to examiner review, use the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective rather than the apparent or stated notional amount in this calculation. The conversion factors are:

e. Because exchange rate contracts involve an exchange of principal upon maturity, and exchange rates are generally
more volatile than interest rates, higher conversion factors have been established for exchange rate contracts
than for interest rate contracts.

 For interest and exchange rate contracts, sufficiency of collateral or guarantees is determined by the market value
of the collateral or the amount of the guarantee in relation to the credit equivalent amount. Collateral and guarantees
are subject to the same provisions noted under section III.B. of this appendix A. Collateral held against a netting
contract is not recognized for capital purposes unless it is legally available to support the single legal obligation
created by the netting contract.

Netting.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 a. For purposes of this appendix A, netting refers to the offsetting of positive and negative mark to-market values
in the determination of a current exposure to be used in the calculation of a credit equivalent amount. Any legally
enforceable form of bilateral netting (that is, netting with a single counterparty) of rate contracts is recognized
for purposes of calculating the credit equivalent amount provided that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 i. The netting is accomplished under a written netting contract that creates a single legal obligation, covering
all included individual contracts, with the effect that the organization would have a claim to receive, or obligation
to receive or pay, only the net amount of the sum of the positive and negative mark-to-market values on included individual
contracts in the event that a counterparty, or a counterparty to whom the contract has been validly assigned, fails
to perform due to any of the following events: default, bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 ii. The banking organization obtains a written and reasoned legal opinion(s) representing that in the event of a legal
challenge_including one resulting from default, bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar circumstances_the relevant
court and administrative authorities would find the banking organization's exposure to be such a net amount under:

A walkaway clause is a provision in a netting contract that permits a non-defaulting counterparty to make lower payments
than it would make otherwise under the contract, or no payment at all, to a defaulter or to the estate of a defaulter even
if the defaulter or the estate of the defaulter is a net creditor under the contract.

c. By netting individual contracts for the purpose of calculating its credit equivalent amount, a banking organization
represents that it has met the requirements of this appendix A and all the appropriate documents are in the organization's
files and available for inspection by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve may determine that a banking organization's
files are inadequate or that a netting contract, or any of its underlying individual contracts, may not be legally
enforceable under any one of the bodies of law described in paragraph 5.a.ii.

. of section III of this appendix A. If such a determination is made, the netting contract may be disqualified from recognition
for risk-based capital purposes or underlying individual contracts may be treated as though they are not subject
to the netting contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 d. The credit equivalent amount of rate contracts that are subject to a qualifying bilateral netting contract is calculated
by adding (i) the current exposure of the netting contract, and (ii) the sum of the estimates of the potential future
credit exposures on all individual contracts subject to the netting contract, estimated in accordance with section
III.E.2. of this appendix A.

For purposes of calculating potential future credit exposure to a netting counterparty for foreign exchange contracts
and other similar contracts in which notional principal is equivalent to cash flows, total notional principal is
defined as the net receipts falling due on each value date in each currency. The reason for this is that offsetting contracts
in the same currency maturing on the same date will have lower potential future exposure as well as lower current exposure.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
e. The current exposure of the netting contract is determined by summing all positive and negative mark-to-market
values of the individual contracts included in the netting contract. If the net sum of the mark-to-market values is
positive, then the current exposure of the netting contract is equal to that sum. If the net sum of the mark-to-market
values is zero or negative, then the current exposure of the netting contract is zero. The Federal Reserve may determine
that a netting contract qualifies for risk-based capital netting treatment even though certain individual contracts
may not qualify. In such instances, the nonqualifying contracts should be treated as individual contracts that are
not subject to the netting contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 f. In the event a netting contract covers contracts that are normally excluded from the risk-based ratio calculation_for
example, exchange rate contracts with an original maturity of fourteen calendar days or less, or instruments traded
on exchanges that require daily payment of variation margin_an institution may elect to consistently either include
or exclude all mark-to-market values of such contracts when determining net current exposure.

1. The credit equivalent amount of a rate contract is the sum of the current credit exposure of the contract and an estimate
of potential future increases in credit exposure. The current exposure is the positive mark-to-market value of the
contract (or zero if the mark-to-market value is zero or negative). For rate contracts that are subject to a qualifying
bilateral netting contract the current exposure is the net sum of the positive and negative mark-to-market values
of the contracts included in the netting contract (or zero if the net sum of the mark-to-market values is zero or negative).
The potential future exposure is calculated by multiplying the effective notional amount of a contract by one of the
following credit conversion factors, as appropriate:

upon two floating indices, that is, so called floating/floating or basis swaps. The credit exposure on these contracts
is evaluated solely on the basis of their mark-to-market value. Exchange rate contracts with an original maturity
of fourteen days or less are excluded. Instruments traded on exchanges that require daily payment of variation margin
are also excluded.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Garrett Turbine Engine Company ATF3 series
turbofan engines, that requires a one-time inspection for cracks of the curvic and bore area of the high pressure turbine
(HPT) rotor assembly disk, and replacement, if necessary, with a serviceable disk. This amendment is prompted by
several reports of cracks discovered during routine inspections of HPT rotor assembly disks. The actions specified
by this AD are intended to prevent an uncontained failure of the HPT rotor assembly disk.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to Garrett Turbine Engine Company Model ATF3&hyph;6 and &hyph;6A turbofan engines was published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on February 11, 1994 (59 FR 6603). That action proposed to require a one-time inspection for cracks of the curvic and
bore area of high pressure turbine (HPT) rotor assembly disks listed by serial number in Table 1 of Allied-Signal Aerospace
Company, Garrett Engine Division, Alert Service Bulletin (ASB) No. ATF3&hyph;A72&hyph;6184, Revision 1, dated
January 11, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments
were received on the proposal or the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) determination of the cost to the public.
The FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 75 Garrett Turbine Engine Company Model ATF3&hyph;6 and -6A turbofan engines of the affected
design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 2 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry will be affected
by this AD, that it will take approximately 220 work hours per engine to accomplish the required actions, and that the
average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated
to be $24,200.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

 This amendment supersedes telegraphic airworthiness directive (AD) T89&hyph;02&hyph;52, which superseded Telegraphic
AD T88&hyph;22&hyph;51 (AD), applicable to Rolls-Royce, plc (R&hyph;R) Spey series turbofan engines. Telegraphic
AD T88&hyph;22&hyph;51 reduced cyclic life limits for seventh stage high pressure compressor (HPC) disks from 40,000
total part cycles in service (TPC) to 35,000 TPC for the R&hyph;R Spey Model 506&hyph;14 and &hyph;14D engines. Telegraphic
AD T89&hyph;02&hyph;52 currently requires repetitive inspections or further reduced cyclic life limits for seventh

R&hyph;R Spey engine models, eliminates the option for repetitive inspections, and further reduces the cyclic life
limits. This amendment is prompted by further investigation into disk bore cracking that was caused by corrosion.
The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent a seventh stage HPC disk burst due to cracking attributed to
corrosion, which may result in an uncontained engine failure.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority of the United Kingdom, notified the Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) that an unsafe condition may exist on Rolls-Royce, plc 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(R&hyph;R) Spey series turbofan engines. The CAA advised that they received a report of a three-inch crack extending
radially outward from the bore on a seventh stage high pressure compressor (HPC) disk installed in a R&hyph;R Spey
Model 506&hyph;14D engine. The crack originated from a corrosion pit that apparently had been present at the disk's
entry into service. Investigation indicated that failure of the engine due to disk burst was imminent. That condition,
if not corrected, could result in a seventh stage HPC disk burst due to cracking attributed to corrosion, which may
result in an uncontained engine failure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This engine model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States
under the provisions of Section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined
that airworthiness directive (AD) action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for
operation in the United States. On October 20, 1988, the FAA issued Telegraphic AD T88&hyph;22&hyph;51, which reduced
cyclic life limits for seventh stage HPC disks from 40,000 total part cycles in service (TPC) to 35,000 TPC for the R&hyph;R
Spey Model 506&hyph;14 and &hyph;14D engines. On January 26, 1989, the FAA issued Telegraphic AD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
T89&hyph;02&hyph;52, which supersedes Telegraphic AD T88&hyph;22&hyph;51, and currently requires repetitive
inspections or further reduced cyclic life limits for seventh stage HPC disks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) by superseding Telegraphic AD T89&hyph;02&hyph;52
was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 11, 1994 (59 FR 1500). That action proposed to increase the AD's effectivity to include additional R&hyph;R
Spey engine models, eliminate the option for repetitive inspections of seventh stage HPC disks, further reduce the
cyclic life limits, and require removing from service disks that exceed the revised cyclic life limits following
the schedule established in this AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comment received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter concurs with the rule as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comment noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA estimates that 173 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, and that it will
not take any additional work hours per engine to accomplish the required actions. Replacement parts, prorated for
the reduced life, will cost approximately $1,718 per engine. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD
on U.S. operators is estimated to be $297,214. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain Airbus Model A320 series airplanes, that requires modification of the brake 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
steering control unit (BSCU). This amendment is prompted by reports that the BSCU on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these airplanes allowed a 90-degree rotation of the nose gear after landing, which resulted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in significant damage to the wheels. The actions specified by this AD are intended to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevent failure of the nose gear tires and wheels and the loss of directional control of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplane while it is on the ground.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to certain Airbus Model A320 series airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
on April 16, 1993 (58 FR 19787). That action proposed to require modification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the brake steering control unit (BSCU) for certain airplanes equipped with twin wheel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
main landing gears (MLG). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both commenters support the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the issuance of the proposed rule, Airbus issued Service Bulletin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A320&hyph;32&hyph;1100, Revision 1, dated November 9, 1993, which describes procedures for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modification of the BSCU on certain Model A320 series airplanes equipped with bogie 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MLG's. The modification involves upgrading the currently installed standard 3 BSCU 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functional software to a new standard 3.1 BSCU, which includes reprogramming of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain software for each system of the BSCU. Accomplishment of the modification will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allow activation of the nose wheel steering at main gear touchdown, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and authorization of rudder pedal action that would allow progressive amplitude authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from 130 to 40 knots. The Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airworthiness authority for France, classified this service bulletin as mandatory and issued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
French Airworthiness Directive 92&hyph;117&hyph;025(B)R1, dated August 18, 1993, in order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA finds that Model A320 series airplanes equipped with bogie MLG's are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to the same unsafe condition that is addressed by this rule. In light of this, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA has revised the applicability of the final rule to include these airplanes. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there currently are no Model A320 series airplanes equipped with bogie MLG's on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S. Register; therefore, no additional U.S. airplanes are affected directly by this AD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action. The FAA considers that the revision to the applicability of the rule is necessary in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order to ensure that the unsafe condition is addressed in the event that these specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplanes are imported and placed on the U.S. Register in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the FAA has revised paragraph (a) of the final rule to cite the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate service information for modification of the BSCU on airplanes equipped with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bogie MLG's. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the issuance of the proposed rule, Airbus also has issued Service Bulletin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A320&hyph;32&hyph;1094, Revision 3, dated June 24, 1993. Revision 3 of the service bulletin is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
essentially identical to Revision 2 (which was cited in the proposal as the appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source of service information), but revises the effectivity listing to include one additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplane. The FAA has determined that this additional airplane is operated currently by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-U.S. operator under foreign registry; therefore, this airplane is not affected directly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by this AD action. The FAA has revised paragraph (a) of the final rule to cite Revision 3 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the service bulletin as an additional source of service information for accomplishment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the required modification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined that these changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will neither increase the economic burden on any U.S. operator nor increase the scope of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 52 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it will take approximately 1 work hour per airplane to accomplish the required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplied by the vendor at no cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $2,860, or $55 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Saab Model SAAB SF340A and SAAB 340B
airplanes, that requires repetitive inspections to detect cracking of the tray stop spindle and backrest spindle
bosses on the inboard sections of certain seats; and replacement of the inboard sections, if necessary. This amendment
also requires repair and identification of the modification plate, which would terminate the requirement to inspect
repetitively. This amendment is prompted by reports of fatigue cracking in the vicinity of the tray stop spindle and
backrest spindle bosses, which could lead to excessive movement and eventual failure of the backrest on these seats
during aft loading. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent failure of the backrest on these seats,
which could inhibit emergency egress.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to Saab Model SAAB SF340A and SAAB 340B airplanes, equipped with Flight Equipment and Engineering
Limited Model 121 series seats, was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 3, 1994 (59 FR 22771). That action proposed to require repetitive inspections to detect cracking of the tray
stop spindle and backrest spindle bosses on the inboard sections of certain seats; and replacement of the inboard
sections, if necessary. It also proposed to require repair and identification of the modification plate, which would
terminate the requirement to inspect repetitively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the single comment received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter has no objections to the proposal, but questions the accuracy of the description of the point of failure,
as described in the preamble to the notice. The preamble stated, ``Cracking in this area may weaken the machined component
that attaches the backrest of the seats 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
to the main spars of the airplane
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and may lead to excessive movement and eventual failure of the backrest on these seats during aft loading'' (emphasis
added). The commenter implies that it is not accurate to state that the failure point is where the seat backrests attach
to the main spar of the airplane. The FAA has reconsidered its previous description and concurs that clarification
is warranted. The FAA finds that the following wording comprises a more accurate description: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Cracking in this area may eventually weaken the seat section such that the spindles attaching the table and seat back
to the seat section may break free during crash loads or normal loads. This condition, if not corrected, could result
in failure of the backrest of these seats, which could inhibit emergency egress.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This clarification of the description of the failure scenario in no way alters the basis for issuance of this AD or the
unsafe condition addressed by it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, the FAA has learned that,
in general, some operators may misunderstand the legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability
provision of the AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. Under these circumstances,
at least one operator appears to have incorrectly assumed that its airplane was not subject to an AD. On the contrary,
all airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally subject to the AD. If an airplane has been
altered or repaired in the affected area in such a way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required
to obtain FAA approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the paragraph of each
AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been added to this final rule to clarify this requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has recently reviewed the figures it has used over the past several years in calculating the economic impact
of AD activity. In order to account for various inflationary costs in the airline industry, the FAA has determined
that it is necessary to increase the labor rate used in these calculations from $55 per workhour to $60 per workhour.
The economic impact information below has been revised to reflect this increase in the specified hourly labor rate.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined
that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 73 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 2 work
hours per seat to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. There are usually
34 seats per airplane. Required parts will be provided by the manufacturer at no cost to the operator. Based on these
figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $297,840, or $4,080 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

 This AD applies to each airplane identified in the preceding applicability provision, regardless of whether it has
been modified, altered, or repaired in the area subject to the requirements of this AD. For airplanes that have been
modified, altered, or repaired so that the performance of the requirements of this AD is affected, the owner/operator
must use the authority provided in paragraph (c) to request approval from the FAA. This approval may address either
no action, if the current configuration eliminates the unsafe condition; or different actions necessary to address
the unsafe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition described in this AD. Such a request should include an assessment of the effect of the changed configuration
on the unsafe condition addressed by this AD. In no case does the presence of any modification, alteration, or repair
remove any airplane from the applicability of this AD.

To prevent failure of the backrest on these seats, which could inhibit emergency egress, accomplish the following:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Within 28 days after the effective date of this AD, perform a detailed visual inspection to detect cracking of the
tray stop spindle and backrest spindle bosses of the inboard section of the seat, in accordance with FEEL Service Bulletin
25&hyph;20&hyph;1287, Revision 3, dated March 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If no cracking is found, or if cracking is found that does not penetrate the shear web, repeat the inspection of that
seat thereafter at intervals not to exceed 150 hours time-in-service until the requirements or paragraph (b) of this
AD are accomplished. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If any cracking is found that penetrates the shear web, prior to further flight, replace the inboard section (up
to issue 12), and identify the modification plate with ``25&hyph;20&hyph;1287A,'' in accordance with the service
bulletin. Thereafter, repeat the inspection at intervals not to exceed 150 hours time-in-service until the requirements
of paragraph (b) of the AD are accomplished. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Within 6 months after the effective date of this AD, repair and identify the modification plate with ``25&hyph;20&hyph;1294,''
in accordance with FEEL Service Bulletin 25&hyph;20&hyph;1294, Revision 1, dated May 1993. Accomplishment of the
actions required by this paragraph constitutes terminating action for the requirements of this AD.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to certain Jetstream Model ATP airplanes. This action requires inspections to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detect cracking in certain oil coolers, and replacement of cracked coolers with serviceable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coolers. The amendment also provides for termination of the inspections by installing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain reworked and re-identified oil coolers. This amendment is prompted by reports of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cracking in the welded seams of certain oil coolers. The actions specified in this AD are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended to prevent loss of engine oil due to cracking in the oil cooler, which may lead to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a forced shutdown of the engine.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified
the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Jetstream Model ATP airplanes. The CAA advises that it has received
reports of cracking in the welded seams of certain engine oil coolers that are cooled by ram air. Investigation revealed
that these oil coolers were welded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorrectly during the manufacturing process. These defective welds have been isolated to oil coolers manufactured
by Normalair-Garrett Limited and having part numbers (P/N) 8248C000, 8439C000, and 8714C000. Such cracking, if
not corrected, could result in loss of engine oil, which may lead to a forced shutdown of the engine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Jetstream has issued Service Bulletin ATP&hyph;79&hyph;23, dated August 26, 1994, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
describes procedures for repetitive detailed visual inspections to detect cracking in certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine oil coolers that are cooled by ram air. This service bulletin also describes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures for replacement of cracked oil coolers with serviceable oil coolers. The CAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classified this service bulletin as mandatory in order to assure the continued airworthiness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of these airplanes in the United Kingdom. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Jetstream has also issued Service Bulletin ATP&hyph;79&hyph;24&hyph;10360A, dated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
September 4, 1994, which describes procedures for rework and re-identification of oil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coolers having P/N's 8248C000, 8439C000, and 8714C000, that are manufactured by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Normalair-Garrett Limited. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of section 21.29 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, this AD is being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issued to prevent loss of engine oil that may lead to a forced shutdown of the engine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This AD requires repetitive detailed visual inspections to detect cracking in oil coolers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
having P/N 8248C000, 8439C000, or 8714C000, and replacement of cracked oil coolers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with serviceable oil coolers. Installation of oil coolers that have been reworked and re-identified terminates
the requirement for repetitive detailed visual inspections. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of America, the FAA has learned that, in general, some operators may misunderstand the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability provision of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. The FAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
points out that all airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to the AD. If an airplane has been altered or repaired in the affected area in such a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required to obtain FAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph of each AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been included in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule to clarify this requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days.

Comments Invited
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this rule must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;199&hyph;AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and that it is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866.
It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be
significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed
in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Model 747 series airplanes.
This action requires inspections to detect cracking of the surfaces of the outboard strut spring beam, and replacement
of cracked spring beams. It also requires an inspection to detect damage to the structure that is adjacent to the cracked
spring beam, and replacement of any cracked parts. This amendment is prompted by a report of failure of a spring beam
due to cracking that was propagated by fatigue. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent failure of
a spring beam, which could lead to loss of an outboard strut.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Recently, the FAA received a report that the spring beam on a Boeing Model 747&hyph;200 series airplane equipped with
Pratt &amp; Whitney (P&amp;W) Model JT9D&hyph;70 engines was severed (failed) forward of the mid pivot bolt housing
at the outboard spring beam on the number 4 outboard strut. Investigation revealed that cracking initiated at a flaw
(porosity) in the material of the spring beam and propagated due to fatigue. The subject airplane was operated as a
freighter and had accumulated 15,809 total flight cycles on the struts. This airplane was originally delivered with
P&amp;W Model JT9D&hyph;3 engines and struts, but was later reconfigured with P&amp;W Model JT9D&hyph;70 engines
and struts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Spring beams are used in place of midspar fittings on the outboard struts of all Model 747 series airplanes, except
those equipped with P&amp;W Model JT9D&hyph;3 and &hyph;7 engines. (The P&amp;W Model JT9D&hyph;3 and &hyph;7 engines
have midspar fittings at the outboard strut.) Airplanes equipped with P&amp;W Model JT9D&hyph;70 engines have spring
beams that are made of titanium. All other spring beams are made of steel, which analyses and tests have shown to be more
resistant to fatigue cracking than titanium spring beams. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fatigue cracking, if not corrected, could result in failure of a spring beam, which could lead to the loss of an outboard
strut. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
747&hyph;54A2171, dated October 31, 1994, which describes procedures for repetitive detailed visual inspections
to detect cracking of the upper, lower, and side surfaces of the spring beam, and replacement of cracked spring beams
with new spring beams. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other airplanes of the same type design, this AD is being issued to prevent failure of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spring beam due to fatigue cracking, which could lead to the loss of an outboard strut. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This AD requires repetitive detailed visual inspections to detect cracking of the surfaces 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the spring beam from the root of the clevis lugs to the forward journal, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replacement of cracked spring beams with new spring beams. This AD also requires an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional detailed visual inspection to detect damage of the adjacent spring beam and all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
support fittings of the affected strut, and replacement of any cracked parts with new parts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the alert service bulletin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As an alternative to the repetitive detailed visual inspections, this AD also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides for an optional terminating action, which entails removing the spring beam, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplishing a fluorescent dye penetrant inspection, and accomplishing a zero-time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overhaul of the spring beam, in accordance with Section 54&hyph;00&hyph;01 of the Boeing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Overhaul Manual, and reinstalling that spring beam. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of America, the FAA has learned that, in general, some operators may misunderstand the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability provision of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. The FAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
points out that all airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to the AD. If an airplane has been altered or repaired in the affected area in such a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required to obtain FAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph of each AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been included in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule to clarify this requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is found that notice and opportunity for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affecting flight safety and, thus, was not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons are invited to comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the address specified under the caption

ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. All communications received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would be needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental, and energy aspects of the rule that might suggest a need to modify the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filed in the Rules Docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted in response to this rule must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
94&hyph;NM&hyph;207&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be issued immediately to correct an unsafe condition in aircraft, and that it is not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has been determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emergency regulation otherwise would be significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules Docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is exempting 148 generic types of class I devices from the requirement of premarket
notification, with limitations. For the exempted devices, FDA has determined that manufacturers' submissions
of premarket notifications are unnecessary for the protection of the public health and that the agency's review of
such submissions will not advance its public health mission. The exemptions allow the agency to make better use of
its resources and thus better serve the public.

Effective January 6, 1995. Beginning on January 6, 1995, all device manufacturers who have 510(k) submissions pending
FDA review for devices falling within a generic category which is subject to this rule, will receive a letter stating
that the device is exempt from the premarket notification requirements of the act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
of July 21, 1994 (59 FR 37378), FDA issued a proposed rule to exempt 164 generic types of class I devices from the requirement
of premarket notification, with limitations. Interested persons were given until October 19, 1994 to comment on
the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the comment period, FDA received comments requesting that various devices be added to the list of devices that
the agency was proposing be exempt from the requirement of premarket notification. The agency also received comments
requesting that existing exemptions from the requirement of premarket notification for several devices, when made
of certain materials, be expanded to include all devices within the classification, regardless of material composition.
FDA is considering these comments and will address them in a future issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments requested that certain devices proposed for exemption from premarket notification also be exempted
from the requirements of current good manufacturing practices (CGMP's) and records and reports. FDA has decided
not to grant these additional exemptions at this time. Pursuant to 21 CFR 820.1(d), any person petitioning for an exemption
from any device CGMP requirement is required to follow the procedures set forth in 21 CFR 10.30. Accordingly, the devices
listed in this final rule as exempt from premarket notification continue to be subject to applicable CGMP requirements.
FDA believes that compliance with CGMP's is necessary in order to ensure adequate protection of the public health.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several comments questioned the appropriateness of the proposed exemptions for a small number of the devices. In
addition, FDA is reconsidering the appropriateness or scope of the proposed exemptions for several devices included
in the proposed rule. Therefore, FDA is deferring action on the following 16 devices in order to review these comments
and to reevaluate whether certain of the devices should be exempted from the requirement of premarket notification.

FDA will address these devices in a future issue of the Federal Register.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA received no adverse comments on 148 of the devices that it proposed be exempted from the requirement of premarket
notification. For these 148 devices, FDA has concluded that manufacturers' submissions of premarket notifications
are unnecessary for the protection of the public health and that the agency's review of such submissions will not advance
its public health mission. Thus, FDA is finalizing the exemptions for these 148 devices from premarket notification
procedures.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 -->
IV. Environmental Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(e)(2) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 -->
V. Analysis of Impacts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
FDA has examined the impacts of the final rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.
L. 96&hyph;354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory
alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including
potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and
equity). The agency believes that this final rule is consistent with the regulatory philosophy and principles identified
in the Executive Order. In addition, the final rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined by the Executive
Order and so is not subject to review under the Executive Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze regulatory options that would minimize any significant
impact of a rule on small entities. Because this final rule reduces a regulatory burden by exempting manufacturers
of devices subject to the final rule from the requirements of premarket notification, the agency certifies that the
final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, under
the Regulatory Flexibility Act, no further analysis is required.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal funding is authorized under Subtitle A of Title II of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994
(Subtitle A), Public Law 103&hyph;322, for grants to states, and states organized in multi-state compacts, for assistance
to adult and juvenile correctional systems. The program recognizes that states and local jurisdictions have experienced
substantial increases in jail, prison and juvenile confinement populations in recent years, resulting in escalating
costs and serious difficulties in managing overcapacity correctional populations. Because of these constraints,
correctional systems have often been unable to implement new programs, develop alternative confinement strategies,
or open new facilities. This program seeks to provide funds to address the immediate needs of correctional facilities
and programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In particular, the program emphasizes the need to make available both conventional jail and prison space for the confinement
of violent offenders and to ensure that violent offenders remain incarcerated for substantial periods of time through
the implementation of truth in sentencing laws. Accordingly, Subtitle A directs the Attorney General to award grants
to construct, develop, expand, modify, operate, or improve correctional facilities, including boot camp facilities
and other alternative correctional facilities that will free secure prison space for the confinement of violent
offenders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fifty percent of the total amount of funds appropriated each year will be allocated for Truth in Sentencing Incentive
Grants and the other 50 percent will be allocated for Violent Offender Incarceration Grants, 85 percent of which is
to be distributed by specified formula with the remaining 15 percent available for discretionary grant awards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The formula amount available to carry out the grant programs for any fiscal year will be allocated to each eligible
state based on Part 1 violent crime data reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for use in the Uniform Crime
Reports (UCR). If such data is unavailable, applicants may also utilize figures as reported in publications by the
Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS). (See, e.g., ``Census of State and Local Correctional Facilities, 1990.'') 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute contemplates the availability of $7.9 billion in funding over six years, beginning with $175 million
authorized in fiscal year 1995. It is important to note, however, that Congress appropriated only $24.5 million for
Subtitle A programs for fiscal year 1995. Moreover, the Appropriations Act limits these funds to a discretionary
grant program for the construction of correctional boot camps. Specifically, grant awards in fiscal year 1995 are
to develop, construct, or expand boot camp programs which include coordinated, intensive aftercare services following
release. It is anticipated that program guidelines and information outlining the application process for adult
and juvenile boot camp fiscal year 1995 grant awards will be available in January 1995.

Statement of the Problem 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
State and local prison populations continue to grow. Moreover, there are a number of states and local jurisdictions
under court order because of overcrowding in their correctional facilities. The majority of jurisdictions operate
above the total rated capacity for their correctional facilities. Those facilities under court order for overcrowding
which have taken steps to control their burgeoning inmate populations tend to operate at or near capacity in order
to remain in compliance with the court orders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Correctional systems faced with rising prison populations and court-ordered ceilings have responded in various
ways. Some have implemented population management task forces to ensure that violent criminals are not released
as a result of accommodating nonviolent offenders. Others have simply released offenders when their institutions
reach a certain population level, without significant controls over the security classifications of the inmates.
Still other systems under court order have implemented statutory release programs.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subtitle A provides for immediate assistance to correctional systems to contend with this growing inmate population
crisis. Of primary importance is the recognition that there must be adequate conventional confinement space for
violent offenders, both adults and juveniles, to serve a substantial portion of their sentences. This program, therefore,
provides grants to assist correctional systems in managing a comprehensive approach which will provide for the confinement
of violent offenders; help address the problems associated with overcapacity in correctional facilities through
the improvement, development, expansion or modification of present facilities and programs; and support comprehensive
programs and treatment that will assist in reducing recidivism. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Federal, State and Local Partnerships 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because crime is primarily a state and local issue, the Subtitle A grant program envisions a federal, state, and local
collaboration to address the problems associated with the incarceration and punishment of violent offenders. State
and local government officials were involved in the congressional hearings that guided this legislation, and will
continue to be involved as the Department of Justice moves forward in establishing policy guidance, developing regulations,
and implementing program guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, this grant program provides flexibility to states and local governments in utilizing federal funds
to plan, construct, and operate correctional facilities in ways that best meet their needs and in the most cost-effective
manner. Built into the program is the recognition that correctional systems can use grant funds in a variety of ways
to ensure the greatest and most timely impact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Subtitle A, corrections systems will have the ability to quickly bring on-line additional bed space in facilities
which, although construction has been completed, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are not being utilized due to funding constraints. States and local agencies can also activate prison and jail expansion
and juvenile corrections projects that have been planned, but not launched, due to lack of funds. The grant program
further provides for the expansion of alternative correctional options for nonviolent offenders which will free
secure bed space for dangerous offenders to serve their sentences. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, corrections systems will have flexibility in using surplus federal property. Beds for violent offenders
can be made available in secure facilities through the conversion of closed military facilities or other appropriate
federal facilities to facilities for housing low-security inmates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subtitle A also recognizes the benefits of regional prisons, particularly for adjoining localities. The economies
of scale resulting from a multi-state compact prison are particularly beneficial for confining specialized groups
of offenders, such as medical/psychiatric inmates, inmates requiring protective custody, and high security inmates.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The grant program balances appropriate accountability through various eligibility criteria, the availability
of technical assistance, and the evaluation of programs implemented with these funds, with the flexibility states
and local governments require and deserve based on their individual needs and expertise. Grant eligibility criteria
specifically provide for the involvement of counties and local governments and the sharing of funds with these entities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, the federal role provides sufficient structure and definition in the eligibility criteria to meet the
program's goals, while allowing for judgment by grant recipients to take into account the states' various unique
situations, criminal and juvenile justice practices, and correctional systems. The program accounts for the different
needs of the states and local entities, and reflects that there is no ``national standard'' approach that will suit
all jurisdictions. The grant monies are available for the range of correctional needs such as system planning and
facility development, as well as the construction, expansion, modification, improvement, and operation of a variety
of correctional facilities.

Violent Juvenile Crime 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Concern also continues nationwide over the escalation in violent juvenile crime. According to the FBI's Uniform
Crime Reports, juvenile arrests for violent offenses increased dramatically over the five-year period from 1988
to 1992_47 percent_while adult violent crime arrests increased 19 percent. The estimated 129,600 Violent Crime
Index arrests of juveniles in 1992 was the highest in our history, with 3,300 arrests for murder, 6,300 for forcible
rape, 45,700 for robbery and 74,400 for aggravated assault. Moreover, during the past few years, there has been a marked
escalation of homicides by juvenile offenders. Teenage homicides have more than doubled since 1984, and juvenile
homicides involving firearms have increased 175 percent since 1983. Of particular importance is that the size of
the current 14&hyph;17 year-old population, which has been responsible for much of the recent youth violence, will
increase by about 20 percent in the next decade. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``Comprehensive Strategy for Serious, Violent and Chronic Juvenile Offenders,'' developed by the Department's
Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, is the centerpiece of the Department's response to growing
juvenile crime. The Subtitle A grant program is an integral part of the comprehensive strategy's intervention component.
The program is based on the recognition that an effective model for the treatment and rehabilitation of delinquent
offenders must combine accountability and sanctions with increasingly intensive treatment and rehabilitative
efforts at every stage of the continuum.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The intervention component calls for establishing a range of graduated sanctions that includes both immediate interventions
and intermediate sanctions, including both nonresidential and residential placements and programming. Boot camps
offer an intermediate sanction for nonviolent juvenile offenders. These programs should be short-term and include
a formal aftercare phase, actively involving the family and the community in supporting and reintegrating the juvenile
into the community. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the strategy encourages the use of non-residential community-based programs and intensive supervision programs
for many juvenile offenders, it recognizes that the criminal behavior of some serious, violent and chronic offenders
requires the use of secure detention and corrections facilities to protect the community and provide a structured
treatment environment. This grant program will facilitate jurisdictions in meeting the challenge of placing juvenile
offenders in need of confinement in secure facilities.

Grants for Correctional Facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Subtitle A authorization provides for two different grant programs: (1) Violent Offender Incarceration Grants,
and (2) Truth in Sentencing Incentive Grants. Of the total federal funding authorized to Subtitle A grant programs
each year, 50 percent is allocated for each of these two grant initiatives. With the exception of a limited discretionary
grant program, this funding will be distributed to states based on the formula specified in Subtitle A. Although the
statute provides for states and multi-state compacts as the only eligible grant recipients, Subtitle A requires
that states involve counties and other units of local government and share funds received under this program with
them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To be eligible to receive funding under either of the Subtitle A programs, states must comply with a series of assurances
involving sentencing policies and practices and other guarantees of sound correctional systems to ensure that violent
offenders are sufficiently incapacitated and that the public is protected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Included in the assurances are requirements that the state: (1) Implement sentencing reforms that ensure violent
offenders receive sufficiently severe punishments, (2) recognize the rights and needs of crime victims, and (3)
develop a comprehensive correctional management plan that includes diversion programs, particularly drug diversion
programs, community corrections programs, systems designed to accurately evaluate and classify inmates within
the system, and programs and treatment designed to assist in reducing recidivism, including rehabilitation and
treatment programs and job skills. Emphasis will be placed on a corrections system's ability to plan for and implement
these basic components of a comprehensive and coordinated approach to correctional policy.

Comprehensive Correctional Planning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By definition, a comprehensive system involves state and local governments; thus, the development of a comprehensive
plan necessitates a partnership and collaboration among state and local entities. Because the flow of offenders
begins at the local level, both local and state governments play key roles in the punishment of offenders through alternative
sanctions and incarceration in correctional facilities. The input of county and municipal juvenile and criminal
justice officials will be considered essential to creating an effective overall state strategy to meet the goals
of this grant program. Both local and state governments also have a strong interest in any change in the capacity of
any component of the corrections system. The statutory assurances are clear in their intent that states are expected
to share funds with local units of government in support of effective implementation of the comprehensive plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participants in the comprehensive plan development should represent a broad mix of interested and involved organizations
and officials from varying perspectives. Every effort should be made by the state to include mayors, city and county
officials, police departments, sheriffs, judges, prosecutors, community corrections administrators, representatives
from the treatment and education communities and indigent defense, concerned citizens, and victims' advocates,
as well as the juvenile justice system. Applicants should also take an active role in involving state and juvenile
justice administrative agencies and advisory boards. The manner in which criminal and juvenile justice functions
are structured in various states and their relationships with other justice agencies will affect the roles played
in the development of an effective correctional plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comprehensive correctional plan must address how the state has involved local jurisdictions and the plan for
sharing funds with local facilities, truth in sentencing and victims' rights issues, and the continuum of correctional
options required for adult and juvenile offenders. It must meet the overall goal of incarcerating violent offenders,
and must convey the options for nonviolent offenders that will free up traditional bed space to accomplish that goal.

Victims' Rights and Needs

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To be eligible to receive grants, states must provide assurances that they have implemented policies that provide
for the recognition of the rights and needs of crime victims. No specific requirements for complying with this condition
are prescribed by this interim rule in relation to fiscal year 1995 funding because of the need for comprehensive review
of the status of victims' rights measures in state systems. State applications for fiscal year 1995 funding should
include information on measures which are in effect or under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration in the state to protect the rights and interests of crime victims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
More definitive guidance will be provided concerning compliance with this condition in a final rule or related guidelines
for funding in fiscal year 1996 and thereafter. Areas that have been identified as implicating important rights and
needs of crime victims include: (1) Providing notice to victims concerning case and offender status, (2) providing
an opportunity for victims to be present at public court proceedings, (3) providing victims the opportunity to be
heard at sentencing and parole hearings, (4) providing for restitution and other compensation to victims, and (5)
establishing administrative mechanisms or other mechanisms to effectuate these rights.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States that expect to seek funding under this program in fiscal year 1996 or thereafter are encouraged to review the
status of victim rights measures in their systems, particularly with reference to the five areas identified above.
Federal law incorporates significant measures in each of these areas for federal cases. The provisions of federal
law governing these issues may be useful for states as a possible model for reform, if they have not already adopted
similar measures in their own systems. See 42 U.S.C. 10606(b)(3), (7), 10607(c) (notice concerning case and offender
status); 42 U.S.C. 10606(b)(4) (right to be present at public court proceedings); Rule 32 of the Federal Rules of Criminal
Procedure, as amended effective December 1, 1994 (right of allocution in sentencing for victims); 18 U.S.C. 3663,
3553(c) (general restitution provisions for federal cases); 42 U.S.C. 10607(a) and (b), 10607(c)(5) (assignment

Truth in Sentencing Incentive Grants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To be eligible to receive funding under the Truth in Sentencing Grant Program, in addition to meeting the assurances
listed in Subtitle A, states must also meet certain sentencing requirements. In particular, to qualify for this part
of the grant program, states must have in effect sentencing laws that either provide for violent offenders to (1) serve
not less than 85 percent of their sentences, or (2) meet other requirements that ensure that violent offenders, and
especially repeat violent offenders, remain incarcerated for substantially greater percentages of their imposed
sentences. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Office of Justice Programs is aware that the vast majority of states will at present have difficulty in meeting
the condition that violent offenders serve at least 85 percent of the sentence imposed. No specific guidance for complying
with this assurance is prescribed at this time both because funding for this program is not available in FY '95, and
also because of the need for further review of state compliance issues. Moreover, we are particularly interested
in comments from the field on compliance issues and on the definition of ``violent offender'' for purposes of truth
in sentencing grant awards.

FY 1995 Correctional Boot Camp Initiative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The availability of funds each year is, of course, limited by the appropriations process. In fiscal year 1995, Congress
has allocated $24.5 million to Subtitle A grant programs and has imposed additional limitations on the uses of these
grant funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with congressional intent, grant awards in fiscal year 1995 will be for construction-related costs of
correctional boot camps and will be allocated through the discretionary grant component of the Violent Offender
Incarceration Grant Program. Construction-related costs are broadly interpreted to include costs associated
with both the planning and development of the facility. OJP is expressly precluded, however, from funding operating
expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, grant funds can be used to plan, develop, construct, or expand adult and juvenile boot camp programs
which must include coordinated, intensive aftercare services for inmates following release. Pursuant to the requirements
specified in Subtitle A, boot camps are correctional programs of no longer than six-months incarceration and must:
(1) Exclude offenders who have at any time been convicted of a violent felony or similarly adjudicated juveniles,
(2) adhere to a regimented schedule, (3) provide for inmate participation in education, job training and substance
abuse counseling or treatment, and (4) coordinate intensive aftercare services with the services provided during
the period of confinement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The program emphasis in fiscal year 1995 will be on the construction, renovation and expansion of correctional boot
camp facilities that will free conventional prison, jail and juvenile correctional space for the confinement of
violent offenders so they can serve a substantial amount of their imposed sentences. To receive funds, correctional
systems will have to demonstrate, through a comprehensive correctional plan and prisoner screening and security
classification system, that (1) there is a need for additional secure confinement space for violent offenders, and
(2) this need will be met through the construction of a boot camp facility that provides housing otherwise unavailable
for nonviolent offenders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to juvenile facilities, priority will be given to juvenile boot camps that are designed to prevent juvenile
offenders at risk from becoming violent offenders. This desired outcome will most likely be accomplished if the jurisdiction
engages in efforts that maximize the likelihood that juvenile boot camp participants would otherwise be incarcerated
in traditional secure facilities (e.g., participation limited to those youths who have been adjudicated delinquents
and who have been sentenced to the juvenile state correctional agency). Among this population, juvenile offenders
whose escalating patterns of delinquent behavior indicate that an authoritative boot camp intervention is likely
to suppress or abate emerging tendencies towards chronic or violent delinquent behavior should be considered prime
candidates for boot camp participation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To be eligible to receive grants for correctional boot camp construction, states must meet the eligibility criteria
outlined for the Violent Offender Incarceration Grant Program, including the assurances specified in Section 20101(b)
of Subtitle A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Detailed program guidelines and application material for the fiscal year 1995 correctional boot camp initiative
will be available in January 1995.

Technical Assistance and Training/Evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In keeping with the intent of Congress to assist states in meeting these assurances, the Department proposes to designate
up to 10 percent of the funds available in this program to provide technical assistance and training to states that
presently do not meet the required general assurances or want to expand and improve on current efforts in these areas.
Specifically, the Department will provide training and assistance to states with the comprehensive corrections
planning process, the development of truth in sentencing statutes, and in otherwise moving toward compliance with
the required conditions. States which meet the general assurances in fiscal year 1995, or are working toward compliance,
will be in a better position to receive grant monies under these programs over the next several years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, it is the intent of the Department that selected federal initiatives under the new anti-crime law be evaluated.
To accomplish this goal, a portion of the overall funds authorized under this Subtitle will be set aside for purposes
of implementing a national evaluation strategy. Recipients of funds must agree to cooperate with federally-sponsored
evaluations of their projects and to conduct evaluations as required by the national evaluation strategy. In addition,
recipients of program funds will be required to conduct a local assessment and report on program implementation.

of crime victims'' [&sect;91.3(b)(2)]; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) How a state can demonstrate that, as a result of the funds received under this section, secure space will be made
available for the confinement of violent offenders [&sect;91.3(b)(3)]; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) How to ensure that states have met the condition to involve and share funds received with counties and other units
of local government [&sect;91.3(b)(5)]; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) How a state can demonstrate compliance with the condition for receiving Truth in Sentencing Incentive Grants,
i.e., ``persons convicted of violent crimes serve not less than 85% of the sentence imposed'' [&sect;91.4(b)].

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulation has been drafted and reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866, section 1(b), Principles
of Regulation. This rule is a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866, section 3(f), Regulatory
Planning and Review, and accordingly this rule has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Justice Programs in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)) has reviewed this regulation and by approving it certifies that this regulation will not have
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No information collection requirements are contained in this rule. Any information collection requirements contained
in future application notices for programs authorized by this rule will be reviewed by the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB), as is required by the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 91 U.S.C. 3504(h). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This regulation is being published as an interim final rule, without prior publication of notice and comment, and
is made effective immediately, for good cause as explained below. Under 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(2), matters relating to grants
are exempted from notice and comment requirements. Moreover, in this case, advance notice and comment would be impractical
and contrary to the public interest. Title II, Subtitle A of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994
requires the publication of regulations implementing the grant program within 90 days of enactment of the Act.

In order to satisfy congressional requirements and intentions of expeditious implementation, these regulations
are effective immediately so that eligible states may apply for the boot camp discretionary program. Publishing
a notice of proposed rulemaking and awaiting receipt of comments would significantly delay the implementation of
the FY '95 boot camp grant program. Such delay would be contrary to the public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest and would contradict the congressional intent to provide immediate grant assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although OJP will proceed expeditiously with regard to the promulgation of guidelines for the fiscal year 1995 boot
camp program, we are very interested in receiving public comment on the overall program and will consider all comments
in preparing the final rule.

truth in sentencing laws. No specific requirements for complying with this condition are prescribed by this interim
rule for fiscal 1995 funding because of the need for further review of the status of truth in sentencing laws and the
impact and needs requirements relating to reform in state systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Assurances that the state(s) have implemented or will implement policies that provide for the recognition of
the rights and needs of crime victims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States are not required to adopt any specific set of victims rights measures for compliance, but the adoption by a state
of measures which are comparable to or exceed those applied in federal proceedings will be deemed sufficient compliance
for eligibility for funding. If the state has not adopted victims rights measures which are comparable to or exceed
federal law, the adequacy of compliance will be determined on a case-by-case basis. States will be afforded a reasonable
amount of time to achieve compliance. States may comply with this condition by providing recognition of the rights
and needs of crime victims in the following areas: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (i) providing notice to victims concerning case and offender status; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (ii) providing an opportunity for victims to be present at public court proceedings in their cases; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (iii) providing victims the opportunity to be heard at sentencing and parole hearings; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (iv) providing for restitution to victims; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (v) establishing administrative or other mechanisms to effectuate these rights.

correctional facilities to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 ensure that secure space is available for the confinement of violent offenders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (4) Assurances that the state(s) has a comprehensive correctional plan in accordance with the definition elements

 (5) Assurances that the state(s) has involved counties and other units of local government, when appropriate, in
the construction, development, expansion, modification, operation or improvement of correctional facilities
designed to ensure the incarceration of violent offenders and that the state(s) will share funds received with counties
and other units of local government, taking into account the burden placed on these units of government when they are
required to confine sentenced prisoners because of overcrowding in state prison facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (6) Assurances that funds received under this section will be used to supplement, not supplant, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 other federal, state, and local funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (7) Assurances that the state(s) has implemented, or will implement within 18 months after the date of the enactment

status of inmates and to ensure that incarcerated veterans receive the veterans benefits to which they are entitled.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (8) Assurances that correctional facilities will be made accessible to persons conducting investigations under
the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. 1997. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (9) If applicable, documentation of the multi-state compact agreement that specifies the construction, development,
expansion, modification, operation, or improvement of correctional facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(c) States, and states organized as multi-state compacts, which can demonstrate affirmative responses to the assurances
outlined above will be eligible to receive funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Each state application for such funds must be accompanied by a comprehensive correctional plan. The plan shall
be developed in consultation with representatives of appropriate state and local units of government, shall include
both the adult and juvenile correctional systems, and shall provide an assessment of the state and local correctional
needs, and a long-range implementation strategy for addressing those needs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Local units of government, i.e., any city, county, town, township, borough, parish, village or other general
purpose subdivision of a state, or Indian tribe which performs law enforcement functions as determined by the secretary
of the Interior, are in turn eligible to receive subgrants from a participating state(s). Such subgrants shall be
made for the purpose(s) of carrying out the implementation strategy, consistent with state(s) comprehensive correctional
plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) In awarding grants, consideration shall be given to the special burden placed on states which incarcerate a substantial
number of inmates who are in the United States illegally. States will not be required to submit additional information
on numbers of criminal aliens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) and the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) are currently working
together to implement the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP) to assist the states with the costs of incarcerating
criminal aliens. The Office of Justice Programs will coordinate with the SCAAP program to obtain the relevant information.

General. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Scope of Boot Camp Program. Funding is appropriated in fiscal year 1995 to provide grants to states and multi-state
compacts to plan, develop, construct and expand correctional boot camps for adults and juveniles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Adult and juvenile boot camps, referred to as ``correctional boot camps,'' are programs that ``provide a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 structured environment for delivering non-traditional corrections programs to criminal offenders.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) With respect to this program, the mandates of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (42 U.S.C. Sec.
5601 et seq.) shall apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Eligibility. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Funding is available for both adult and juvenile boot camps. To be eligible for the funding of boot camps, states
must comply with the general assurances in &sect;91.3(b) or demonstrate steps taken toward compliance. While the
majority of assurances are applicable to the adult correctional system, those states applying for grants for juvenile
boot camps must include the juvenile system in the state comprehensive correctional plan and demonstrate how construction
of the boot camp will make secure space available to house violent juvenile offenders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For purposes of the FY '95 boot camp program, a ``violent felony'' means any crime punishable by imprisonment for
a term exceeding one year, or an act of juvenile delinquency that would be punishable by imprisonment for such term
if committed by an adult, that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) involves the use or attempted use of a firearm or other dangerous weapon against another person, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) results in death or serious bodily injury to another person. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) States must document that the boot camp program does not involve more than six-months confinement (not including
confinement prior to assignment to the boot camp) and includes: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) assignment for participation in the program, in conformity with state law, by prisoners other than prisoners
who have been convicted at any time of a violent felony; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) adherence by inmates to a highly regimented schedule that involves strict discipline, physical training and
work; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) participation by inmates in appropriate education, job training, and substance abuse counseling or treatment;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) post-incarceration aftercare services for participants that are coordinated with the program carried out
during the period of imprisonment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) States must provide assurances that boot camp construction will free up secure institutional bed space for violent
offenders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Evaluation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Recipients will be required to cooperate with a national evaluation team throughout the planning and implementation
process. Recipients are also strongly encouraged to provide for an independent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation of the impact and effectiveness of the funded program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Jurisdictions are strongly encouraged to engage in systematic planning activities and to develop and evaluate
boot camps as part of a comprehensive and integrated correctional plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Limitation on funds. Grant funds cannot be used for operating costs. States will be required to show how operating
expenses will be provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Matching Requirement. The federal share of a grant received may not exceed 75 percent of the costs of the proposed
boot camp program described in the appoved application. The matching requirement can only be met through a hard cash
match, and must be satisfied by the end of the project period; facility operating expenses may not be used to meet the
match requirement for the construction project supported. Match may be made through grantee contribution of construction-related
costs. A certification to that effect will be required of each recipient of grant funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Innovative Boot Camp Programs. Jurisdictions are encouraged to explore the development of ``innovative'' boot
camp programs which incorporate principles based on the accumulation of research and practical experience, and
reflect sound and effective correctional practice.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a Notice of Proposed Rule Making has not been published for this regulation and good
cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. The original application to
hold this event was not submitted until October 25, 1994 to Coast Guard Group Baltimore. Because of the late original
submission date and the additional changes there was not sufficient time remaining to publish proposed rules in advance
of the event or to provide for a delayed effective date. Publishing an NPRM and delaying its effective date would be
contrary to the public interest since immediate action is needed to prevent hazards to the boating community.

Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Baltimore Office of Promotion requested a safety zone for the Baltimore Inner Harbor fireworks display to take
place December 31, 1994/January 1, 1995 with an alternate date of January 1, 1995. Because of the way the fireworks
display will be set up, the Coast Guard Marine Safety Office Baltimore has determined that two separate safety zones
will be necessary to protect the public and control spectator craft during this event.

Discussion of Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard Marine Safety Office Baltimore is establishing safety zones around two fireworks barges that will
be anchored in the Inner Harbor, Baltimore, Maryland. One barge (Barge A) will be anchored in the middle of the Inner
Harbor Basin, 250 yards off of the west sea wall and the second barge (Barge B) will be anchored approximately 400 yards
west of the West Channel Turning Basin.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Safety Zone (A) will be around barge A and will encompass all waters of the Inner Harbor that lie within a circle with
a radius of 200 feet, with the center of the circle being the fireworks barge A. Safety Zone (B) will be around barge B,
and will encompass all waters of the Inner Harbor that lie within a circle with a radius of 840 feet, with the center of
the circle being fireworks barge B.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Spectators that wish to watch the fireworks display aboard their vessels may anchor outside of the safety zones, but
they may not anchor in or block a navigable channel. Patrol craft will be on hand to assist the boating public and ensure
safety of life and property during the event.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the Inner Harbor will not be closed for an extended period during these safety zones, vessel traffic should not
be severely disrupted.

Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an
assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by
the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures
of DOT is unnecessary.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Small Entities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulation will only be in effect for two hours, therefore, the Coast Guard expects the impact of this rule to be
minimal. The Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this rule will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental Assessment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this proposal consistent with Section 2.B.2.C. of Commandant
Instruction M16475.1B, and actions to protect public safety have been determined to be categorically excluded from
further environmental documentation.

The Coast Guard is establishing a moving safety zone for the departure of the Deck Barge Isle Del Sol and the Escorting
Tugs on the Savannah River from Marcona Ocean Industries Dock, Fort Jackson continuing throughout its transit until
it is east of the Colreg Demarcation Line. The zone will consist of an area within a 50 yard radius around the tugs and
deck barge during its transit in the Savannah River. The Captain of the Port has restricted vessel operations in this
safety zone. No persons or vessels will be allowed to enter or operate within this zone, except as may be authorized
by the Captain of the Port, Savannah, Georgia. This regulation is issued pursuant to 33 U.S.C. 1231, as set out in the

and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects
the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory
policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. The safety zone will be in effect for a total of 8 hours between November
21, 1994 and December 19, 1994. The specific times are as published in Coast Guard District Seven local notice to mariners.

Since the impact of this proposal is expected to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies that, if adopted, it will not
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Copyright Royalty Tribunal Reform Act of 1993, Pub. L 103&hyph;198, 107 Stat. 2304, eliminated the Copyright
Royalty Tribunal (CRT) and replaced it with a system of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
ad hoc
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels (CARPs) administered by the Librarian of Congress (Librarian) and the Copyright
Office (Office). The CARPs adjust royalty rates and distribute royalties collected under the various compulsory
licenses and statutory obligations of the Copyright Act. The CRT Reform Act, which was effective immediately upon
enactment, directed the Librarian and the Office to adopt the rules and regulations of the CRT found in chapter 3 of
37 CFR, 17 U.S.C. 802(d), and provided that the CRT's regulations were to remain in effect until the Librarian adopts
``supplemental or superseding regulations.'' The Office adopted the CRT's rules and regulations on an interim basis
on December 22, 1993, and notified the public that it intended to begin a rulemaking proceeding to revise and update
those rules. 58 FR 67690 (1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office began the rulemaking proceeding with publication of a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on January
18, 1994. 59 FR 2550 (1994). The NPRM contained substantial revisions required by the dual structure of the royalty
rate adjustment and distribution system created by the CRT Reform Act. Since the CRT's rules were designed for a single
administrative body, the Office proposed extensive changes to accommodate the division of authority between the
Librarian and the Copyright Office on the one hand, and the CARPs on the other. In addition to inviting written public
comment, the Copyright Office invited interested parties to a public meeting to discuss the proposed regulations.
More than 50 individuals attended the February 1, 1994, meeting.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After considering the concerns the parties expressed at the February public meeting, and thoroughly reviewing the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The need for immediate adoption of a regulatory framework was underscored by the imminence of a royalty distribution
of money collected under the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 for digital audio recording technology (DART). Section
1007(b), 17 U.S.C., requires determination of a DART controversy and commencement of arbitration proceedings on
March 30 of each year for the prior year's royalty collections. The 1992 DART distribution proceeding was begun by
the Copyright Royalty Tribunal but was suspended when the Tribunal was abolished, and therefore needed to be started
anew. The 1993 DART distribution was begun by the Copyright Office under the new authority conferred by the CRT Reform
Act, and on March 1, 1994, the Office published a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 asking the claimants to the 1992 and 1993 DART royalties to comment as to the existence of any controversies in the royalty
funds. 59 FR 9773 (1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Anticipating a consolidated DART distribution proceeding for the 1992 and 1993 calendar years, the Copyright Office
postponed the date for determination of DART controversies from March 30, 1994, to June 30, 1994, in order to permit
adequate time for the adoption of regulations governing a CARP proceeding. On May 9, 1994, the Office adopted the Interim
Regulations with the intention that they would govern any DART controversies and proceedings beginning June 30,
1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Office created a new subdivision of the regulations devoted entirely to the operation and procedures of the CARPs.
We removed parts 301 through 311 of chapter III of 37 CFR and created subchapters A and B of chapter II. Subchapter A comprises
the Copyright Office rules and procedures, consisting of parts 201&hyph;211, and remains unchanged. New subchapter
B, created by the Interim Regulations, comprises parts 251&hyph;259, and prescribes the rules and procedures of
the CARPs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 251, the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel Rules of Procedure, consists of regulations governing the organization
of the CARPs, access to CARP meetings and records, rules governing the conduct and course of proceedings, and procedures
applicable to rate adjustments and distributions. Part 251 also includes extensive rules of conduct for arbitrators,
as well as appropriate ethical and financial standards. We did not propose any specific rules of conduct in the NPRM,
but did reserve a subpart for such rules and solicited comment from the interested parties on the issue. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 252 contains revised rules for the filing of claims to cable royalties, modeled after the system used by the CRT
for the filing of DART royalty claims. Parts 253 to 256_Use of Certain Copyrighted Works in Connection With Noncommercial
Educational Broadcasting; Adjustment of Royalty Rate for Coin-Operated Phonorecord Players; and Adjustment of
Royalty Payable Under Compulsory License for Making and Distributing Phonorecords_is virtually identical to the
former CRT's rules, with only some minor technical changes. Like part 252, part 257_Filing of Claims to Satellite
Carrier Royalty Fees_is modeled after the royalty claim procedures used by the CRT for DART. Finally, parts 258 and
259_Adjustment of Royalty Fee for Secondary Transmissions by Satellite Carriers and Filing of Claims to Digital
Audio Recording Devices and Media Royalty Payments_contains only minor variations from the former CRT's rules.
Since the CRT Reform Act eliminated the jukebox compulsory license and replaced it with a new provision for negotiated
licenses (formerly section 116A of the Copyright Act, as amended by the CRT Reform Act), the Copyright Office dropped
the regulations governing the filing of jukebox royalty claims (formerly 37 CFR part 305). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to soliciting general comments on the Interim Regulations, the Copyright Office also posed a number of
questions to focus the commentators' attention on specific issues and to encourage the parties to offer their solutions.
The questions ranged from whether certain types of DART proceedings were subject to CARP jurisdiction, 59 FR 23967
(1994), to asking for comment on ten hypothetical scenarios designed to test the parameters of the conduct rules.

II. Suspension of DART Distribution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed above, the Office adopted the Interim Regulations to establish a regulatory framework in time for the
start of DART distribution. The Office postponed the date for determination of controversies to the 1992/93 DART
royalty pools from March 30, 1994, to June 30, 1994, to prepare for the possibility of convening a CARP for DART distribution.
We published a request for comment on the existence of a controversy for the 1992/93 funds, adopted the Interim Regulations,
established a procedural schedule for the filing of comments and motions leading up to a convocation of a CARP, and
published the arbitrator list all before June 30. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 59 FR 9773 (1994) (Request for comments as to existence of controversy and consolidation of 1992 and 1993 funds); 59
FR 23964 (1994) (Interim Regulations); 59 FR 25506 (1994) (Schedule of procedural dates); 59 FR 24486 (1994) (Arbitrator
list). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the Office's request for comments as to the existence of controversies, the Office received a motion,
supported by a majority of the 1992/93 DART claimants, requesting that the 1992/93 DART royalty distribution be consolidated
with the 1994 DART distribution. The movants argued that although they anticipated the existence of controversies,
the amount of royalties in the 1992 and 1993 funds was insufficient to justify the cost of a CARP proceeding. They therefore
requested that the Office suspend all procedural dates and defer all consideration of DART distributions until 1995.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 13, 1994, the Librarian of Congress granted the claimants' motion for suspension of the 1992/1993 DART distribution
proceeding and consolidation of that proceeding with the 1994 DART distribution. 59 FR 35762 (1994). The result of
the Librarian's action is that the first DART distribution proceeding will begin no sooner than March 30, 1995. The
Librarian also authorized distribution of the 1992 and 1993 Nonfeatured Musicians and Nonfeatured Vocalists DART
subfunds_two subfunds not subject to CARP proceedings_and scheduled a public meeting for September 27, 1994, to
discuss what would constitute the best evidence for distribution of the Sound Recordings Fund and the Musical Works
Fund.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the suspension of DART until 1995, the first proceeding conducted by a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel will
likely be distribution of the 1990 and 1991 cable royalties. The claimant groups to 1990/1991 cable royalties have
informed the Copyright Office that they wish to begin proceedings in accordance with final, not interim, regulations.
The Office has already received written comments on the Interim Regulations; therefore, the Copyright Office is
adopting Final Regulations that will govern all rate adjustments and distributions of royalties prescribed by the
CRT Reform Act.

It is important to note that while today's Final Regulations replace the rules contained in the Interim Regulations,
there are several policy determinations and decisions discussed in the preambles to the Interim Regulations and
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking which remain in effect. For example, the Office will continue to consider proceedings
pending before the CRT at the time of its elimination as null and void and without binding effect.

III. Joint Claims

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commentators had extensive comments about the interim rule governing the filing of joint royalty claims. Sections
252.3(4) and 257.3(4) require claimants filing a joint claim to cable and satellite carrier compulsory license royalties,
respectively, to identify at least one secondary transmission containing a claimant's copyrighted works for each
claimant listed in the joint claim. See 59 FR 23992, 23994 (1994). Performing rights societies were exempted from
this requirement by &sect;252.3(a)(4) and &sect;257.3(a)(4). Because these sections generated much controversy,
and because some of the commentators filed a motion requesting that the Office reconsider this part of the regulations,
we find that the issue deserves reconsideration and resolution separate from the general discussion of amendment
to the Interim Regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The former CRT's rules and regulations governing the filing of claims of the CRT, which we adopted on an interim basis
in December 1993, are brief. Section 302.7(a) of the CRT's old rules simply permitted the filing of joint claims for
cable royalties, but provided little else:

For purposes of this clause claimants may file claims jointly or as a single claim. Such filing shall include such information
as the Copyright Royalty Tribunal may require. A joint claim shall include a concise statement of the authorization
for the filing of the joint claim. A performing rights society shall not be required to obtain from its members or affiliates
separate authorizations, apart from their standard agreements, for purposes of this filing and fee distribution.

37 CFR 302.7(a) (1993). To the Copyright Office's knowledge, the Tribunal never adopted or prescribed any additional
requirements for the filing of joint claims, nor was there any guidance on what information should be included in a
claim. Section 309 of the Tribunal's rules, governing the filing of claims to satellite carrier royalties, was even
more concise with respect to the requirements for filing joint claims, stating simply that ``[c]laimants may file
jointly or as a single claim,'' and providing the same exemption for performing rights societies regarding authorizations.

Our NPRM proposed significant revisions to the Tribunal's rules regarding the filing of both cable and satellite
carrier royalty claims. 59 FR 2556, 2557 (1994). The purpose of the proposed revision was to ``implement a procedural
system similar to that adopted by the Tribunal for the filing of digital audio claims.''

at 2566 (cable), 2567 (satellite). Performing rights societies would continue to enjoy an exemption from obtaining
separate authorizations from each of their members for filing a joint claim. For claimants initially filing an individual
claim and later negotiating a joint claim with other claimants, the proposed rules required that either the joint
or individual claimant notify the Copyright Office of the change within 14 days of making the agreement to enter into
a joint claim.

 No mention was made as to whether each joint claimant was required to identify at least one secondary transmission

The Office's proposed changes to the requirements for filing cable and satellite carrier royalty claims elicited
little comment. Only PBS asked for clarification of the requirement for identifying a secondary transmission for
a joint claim; it asked what it took to satisfy the requirement_a statement that merely identified at least one secondary
transmission for at least one of the claimants included within the joint claim, or a statement identifying at least
one secondary transmission for each claimant to the joint claim. See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
59 FR 23979 (1994) (comments of PBS at 2). In discussing PBS' comment in the Interim Regulations, we acknowledged that
the NPRM ``muddie[d] the waters'' for the filing of cable and satellite carrier claims, and the Interim Regulations
deleted the proposed requirement for joint claimants providing a list identifying each claimant to the joint claim.
Id. In so doing, we stated our belief that the former Tribunal's regulations required that a joint claim identify at
least one secondary transmission for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
each 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
joint claimant, and found support for such requirement in the Copyright Act:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
We are troubled, however, by changing what had been a longstanding requirement at the Tribunal for obliging all claimants
to identify at least one secondary transmission of their copyrighted works. While such requirement does undoubtedly
add to the time and expense burdens of joint claimants such as PBS, it is not without purpose. The law states plainly
that cable compulsory license royalties are only to be distributed to ``copyright owners who claim that their works
were the subject of secondary transmissions by cable systems during the relevant semiannual period.'' 17 U.S.C.
111(d)(3). To support such a claim, each claimant may reasonably be asked to identify at least one secondary transmission
of his or her work, thus permitting the Copyright Office to screen the claims and dismiss any claimants who are clearly
not eligible for royalty fees. The requirement will also help to reduce time spent by a CARP determining which claimants
have a valid claim: if only one secondary transmission is identified for one of the joint claimants, then it could not
readily be determined if the other claimants were even eligible for cable royalties.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In an effort to end this confusion we are deleting subsection (e) with its requirement that joint claimants submit
a list identifying all the claimants. Instead, we are amending subsection (a)(4) to require that each claimant to
a joint claim, other than a joint claim filed by a performing rights society on behalf of its members or affiliates,
must identify at least one secondary transmission of his or her works.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commentators protested the Office's decision. PBS/NPR, the Office of the Commissioner of Baseball (Baseball),
RIAA, NAB and Program Suppliers submitted comments devoted solely to the filing requirements for joint claims, with
Program Suppliers asking that reconsideration of the joint claims interim regulations be severed from the instant
proceeding for immediate disposition. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Program Suppliers, comments at 5. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commentators offered essentially four arguments against the Office's decision: (1) to require each joint claimant
to identify a secondary transmission containing its work serves no valid purpose; (2) it creates undue expense; (3)
the Copyright Office is erroneous in believing that the Copyright Royalty Tribunal required each joint claimant
to identify a secondary transmission; and (4) it is unfair and inappropriate to afford performing rights societies
an exemption and not others. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, PBS/NPR argued that ``no substantive purpose is served by the requirement for separate identifications of
secondary transmissions as to each party included within the joint claim; this is simply a jurisdictional prerequisite
that will not determine the distribution of royalties.'' PBS/NPR, comments at 2. Program Suppliers concurred with
this view and criticized the Office's expressed concern that individual program information is needed to assist
it and the CARPs to identify claims that should be dismissed: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[T]he Office's suggestion that such information is needed so it could screen hundreds of yearly filings to determine
eligibility, seems a particularly inefficient use of its resources. *&blank;*&blank;* Furthermore, it is unclear
what action, if any, the Office could take regarding eligibility problems related to an individual claimant within
a joint claim. Even if the Office finds that one claimant is ineligible to receive royalties, we would assume that the
joint claim would still remain a valid claim. Whether and to what extent the share awarded to the joint claimants should
be reduced by the ineligibility of one member of the group are questions for a panel based on the record evidence. Indeed,
such questions are incapable of answers at the filing stage.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Program Suppliers, comments at 3&hyph;4 (footnote omitted). Program Suppliers and Baseball recommended that the
Office should refrain from any examination or ``screening'' of claims as a regular practice, and leave such activities
and eligibility issues to the claimants to raise through motions either to the Librarian or the CARPs. Program Suppliers,
comments at 4; Baseball, comments at 7. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, RIAA asserted that the requirement for each joint claimant to identify a secondary transmission is unduly
expensive and burdensome. Organizations like RIAA, that represent many claimants, would be forced to contact all
of their members and track down a secondary transmission for each one. The problem is compounded by the time lag between
most secondary transmissions and the time period for filings of claims. RIAA, comments at 2&hyph;3. PBS submits that
it devotes roughly 300 hours annually to the task of identifying secondary transmissions for its member stations.
PBS/NPR, comments at 2. These commentators submitted that elimination of the identification requirement for all
joint claimants would dramatically reduce their expense and workload. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, all of the commentators argued that the Copyright Office erred in believing that the Copyright Royalty Tribunal
required each joint claimant to identify a secondary transmission. Apparently, while a reading of the CRT's rules
indicated there may be such a requirement, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
footnote 15, 59 FR 23979 (1994), in actual practice the Tribunal allowed joint claimants to submit only one secondary
transmission of a copyrighted work belonging to one of the joint claimants as establishing a basis for a claim for all
of the joint claimants. Baseball and RIAA submitted several examples of such filings. Baseball, comments at appendix;
RIAA, comments at appendix. They asserted that the CRT interpreted its rules to apply the requirement of identification
of at least one secondary transmission to apply equally to individual claims as well as joint claims, meaning that
identification of a least one secondary transmission of one joint claimant was satisfactory to establish a basis
for the entire joint claim. PBS/NPR, comments at 4&hyph;5. They therefore submitted that the Copyright Office erroneously
interpreted CRT practice and should alter its regulations to conform with CRT precedent. PBS/NPR comments at 6; Program
Suppliers, comments at 5; RIAA, comments at 6; Baseball, comments at 5; NAB, comments at 1.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, Baseball, PBS/NPR, and RIAA objected to the exemption granted performing rights societies from the Interim
Regulations' requirement of identifying at least one secondary transmission for each joint claimant. Baseball
stated that it ``is firmly of the view that it should not be treated less favorably than the performing rights societies,''
noting that the Interim Regulations gave no reason why performing rights societies should enjoy privileged status.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
PBS/NPR, comments at 5. RIAA urged that, if the Copyright Office insists on continuing to require each joint claimant
to identify a secondary transmission, it should broaden the definition of a performing rights society ``to include
not only traditional performing rights societies, but also those joint claimants such as RIAA who, with respect to
the royalties distributed to its members under sections 111 and 119, essentially perform the same functions of `performing
rights societies.''' RIAA, comments at 6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to seeking relief from &sect;&sect;252.3(a)(4) and 257.3(a)(4), several commentators urged the Copyright
Office to reconsider other requirements for the filing of cable and satellite carrier royalty claims. Baseball and
the RIAA urged the Copyright Office to eliminate entirely the requirement of identifying a secondary transmission
to establish a basis for a cable or satellite carrier royalty claim. Baseball, comments at 5&hyph;7; RIAA, comments
at 3, 6. Baseball noted several instances where the CRT refused to dismiss a claim for failure to identify a secondary
transmission, and suggested this demonstrates that ``the secondary transmission identification requirement
did nothing more than unnecessarily increase the costs of claimants.'' Baseball, comments at 6. NAB, however, strongly
opposed Baseball's recommendation, asserting that there is no compelling reason to change the requirement and that
elimination of identification of a secondary transmission would be violative of section 111(d)(3) of the Copyright
Act, which authorizes distribution of royalties only to copyright owners whose works were retransmitted on a distant
signal. NAB, comments at 2&hyph;3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Baseball took the ``hands off'' approach one step further by urging the Copyright Office to refrain from making any
substantive review of royalty claims. Baseball, comments at 6&hyph;7. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See also 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NAB, comments at 2; Copyright Owners, reply comments at 9. Baseball argued that ``[r]outine Copyright Office review
of all claims needlessly increases the costs of all copyright owners and does not serve any useful function,'' concluding
that ``[d]isputes over a particular claimant's eligibility to royalties (when they arise) may be resolved internally
within a Phase II class without involvement of the Copyright Office or a CARP.'' Baseball, comments at 7&hyph;8. Copyright
Owners concurred, stating that ``[t]he parties themselves are in the best position to identify those claimants who
are not entitled to royalties,'' and that they ``do not believe...that the Copyright Office's resources (and Copyright
Owners' royalties) should be expended to screen each and every one of the thousands of claims that will be timely filed
over the years.'' Copyright Owners, reply comments at 9&hyph;10. Copyright Owners do not object, however, to the
Copyright Office returning claims that are not timely filed.

Given the pendency of receipt of cable and satellite carrier royalty claims and the request of Program Suppliers to
sever the joint claims issue from this proceeding, the Copyright Office issued an Order addressing the filing requirements
for joint claims for the 1993 cable and satellite carrier royalties. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in Docket Nos. RM 94&hyph;1A; 94 CARP (93&hyph;CD); 94 CARP (93&hyph;SD)(July 13, 1994). The Office stated that while
it would ``make a decision on the requirement for joint claims when we publish the final rules,'' it would waive the
requirement of identification of a secondary transmission for each joint claimant in &sect;252.3(a)(4) and &sect;257.3(a)(4)
for the July 1994 filing period. As a result of this action, anyone filing a joint claim for 1993 cable or satellite carrier
royalties was only required to identify at least one secondary transmission to establish a basis for the entire joint
claim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Copyright Office has reviewed the comments of the parties regarding the identification of a secondary transmission
requirement for joint claims and is amending &sect;252.3(a)(4) and &sect;257.3(a)(4) to require identification
of at least one secondary transmission for each joint claim, as opposed to at least one for each joint claimant.

 We have stated on several occasions that our intention in implementing the CRT Reform Act is to create a streamlined
process that limits the cost of distribution and rate adjustment proceedings to the participating parties as much
as possible.

See e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 59 FR 23967 (1994). It is apparent from the unanimous opinion of the commentators that requiring identification of
a secondary transmission for each joint claimant would add in some cases a substantial burden and cost to joint claimants
without yielding an appreciable return in administrative efficiency. We are also aware that, in the past, the CRT
did not require identification of a secondary transmission for each joint claimant.

The amended rule, however, does require each joint claim to identify all claimants participating in the joint claim.
Those who are not identified in the joint claim may not be added to it after the filing period. An exception, however,
is made for the performing rights societies when they file cable and satellite carrier claims. If ASCAP, BMI and SESAC
were to file a joint claim, those three organizations would have to be listed in the claim, but when ASCAP, BMI and SESAC
file claims separately, they will not have to list their members or affiliates because of the burden of doing so, and
the recognition that, together, they represent virtually every composer, lyricist, and publisher entitled to royalties.

 A similar exception is not being made for the performing rights societies in the case of DART claims. There, it is not
clear that the performing rights societies represent virtually the entire composer-lyricist-publisher universe,
because they have an affirmative duty to obtain a separate written authorization to collect on behalf of their members
and affiliates and it is unknown how many of them they represent, and because there are other organizations such as
the Harry Fox Agency and the Songwriters Guild who file claims in that proceeding.

By this statement, we do not intend to prejudge controversies in the Music category. We know that there are composers,
lyricists, and publishers, such as ACEMLA and Italian Book Corporation, who are unaffiliated with the three performing
rights societies. However, to the extent that they file claims separate from the three performing rights societies,
they become identified in the filing period as independent, leaving for future proceedings their proper share vis-a-vis
the performing rights societies.

While we are eliminating the requirement of identification of a secondary transmission for each joint claimant,
we are not accepting RIAA and Baseball's recommendation of eliminating the secondary transmission identification
requirement altogether. We agree with NAB that section 111(d)(3) of the Copyright Act authorizes distribution of
cable royalties only to copyright owners whose works were retransmitted on a distant signal. Eliminating the requirement
that the claim identify at least one instance of such qualifying retransmission would effectively eviscerate the
claim requirement itself.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Office also does not accept Baseball, NAB, and Copyright Owners' recommendation that the Office not review claims
for eligibility and sufficiency. Section 801(c) expressly allows the Librarian, before a CARP is convened, to ``make
any necessary procedural or evidentiary rulings that would apply to the proceedings conducted by such panel.'' We
believe that this grant of authority is broad enough to allow the Copyright Office to examine royalty claims for timeliness
and sufficiency. Furthermore, we do not accept Baseball and NAB's argument that review of claims is a waste of copyright
owners' money. Eliminating claims which are untimely filed or patently deficient on their face promotes administrative
efficiency by reducing the workload for the CARPs, which will already be pressed to conduct proceedings and issue
a report within the 180-day time period. The Copyright Office will, therefore, continue to examine royalty claims
for timeliness and sufficiency on their face.

IV. Precontroversy Discovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Of all the issues generated by the CRT Reform Act and the transfer of royalty distributions and rate adjustments to
the Librarian and the CARPs, precontroversy discovery has generated the greatest amount of comment and concern.
The questions are general (Should there be any precontroversy discovery? Who should conduct it?), as well as specific
(What discovery motions may be filed? When and how will discovery orders be issued?). We have examined this controversial
issue extensively and considered all of the arguments. We are adopting as our final rule a solution that we hope will
streamline the evidentiary process for the CARPs: a limited discovery period of 45 days conducted by the Librarian
prior to declaration of a controversy requiring exchange of cases among the participating parties and one round of
discovery motions and rulings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The question of whether or not to have precontroversy discovery, defined as a period for exchange of evidence among
the parties to a distribution or rate adjustment proceeding prior to the Librarian's declaration of a controversy
and convocation of a CARP, has come full circle during the course of this rulemaking proceeding. In reaction to a statement
of Representative William Hughes, Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Intellectual Property and Judicial Administration
of the House Committee on the Judiciary, accompanying the passage of the CRT Reform Act and commenting favorably on
the use of precontroversy discovery and exchange of information,

see
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 139 Cong. Rec. H10973 (daily ed. Nov. 22, 1993), the Copyright Office proposed a precontroversy discovery period
in the NPRM. In the case of distributions, we proposed that the Librarian would declare a 90-day period for discovery
and exchange of documents sometime after the filing of royalty claims for the distribution and ending with the declaration
of the controversy. 59 FR 2550 (Jan. 18, 1994). Similarly, the Librarian would declare a 90-day period for rate adjustment
proceedings corresponding with the time period set aside for consideration of rate adjustment petitions. Any party
to a proceeding could file motions related to discovery with the Librarian during these time periods, as well as ``objections
to royalty claims or petitions, or motions for procedural or evidentiary rulings.''

We particularly seek comments on the scope of such precontroversy discovery: whether it should include interrogatories
of witnesses as well as production of supporting documents, and whether it would advance Chairman Hughes' goal of
reducing costs by being able to stipulate facts and remove issues, or whether the additional procedures might add
costs to the proceeding.

The commentators did not approve of the NPRM's precontroversy discovery proposal. In fact, the commentators urged
the Librarian and the Copyright Office to refrain completely from conducting any precontroversy discovery, and
proposed a unique solution whereby the CARPs could be convened for conducting such discovery prior to the beginning
of the 180-day arbitration period.

 59 FR 23964, 23976 (1994). Under the proposal offered by Copyright Owners, a distinction would be made between ``the
commencement of proceedings'' in 17 U.S.C. 803(d) and the ``notice initiating an arbitration proceeding'' described
in 17 U.S.C. 802(b) and (e). The Copyright Office would first declare the ``commencement of proceedings'' and then
immediately require the filing of written direct cases and empanel the CARP; discovery motions and objections would
be ruled on by the CARP. After discovery was completed, the Office would ``initiate an arbitration proceeding,''
and at that point the statutory 180-day arbitration period would begin to run. 59 FR 23977 (1994) (comments of Copyright

[A]s a matter of statutory construction, the Office cannot agree that the ``commencement of proceedings'' can be
conceptually separated from ``initiating an arbitration proceeding'' so as to permit the CARP to sit earlier than
the 180-day arbitration period. Section 802(b) (of the Copyright Act), which first uses the phrase ``initiating
an arbitration proceeding,'' employs it in the context of ``a notice in the

which &sect;802(b) refers is the ``notice of commencement of proceedings.'' Therefore, the phrases refer to each
other and must be considered synonymous. (parenthetical added).

by the Librarian; and (3) submission of and ruling on direct case discovery motions and objections by the Librarian,

Copyright Owners ask the Copyright Office to reconsider their proposal of convening CARPs prior to commencement
of the 180-day arbitration period, suggesting that the Office could consider that the phrases ``notice initiating
an arbitration proceeding'' and ``notice of commencement of proceedings'' have different meanings and therefore
could constitute two separate events. For the reasons described in the Interim Regulations, however, the Office
is adhering to its position that CARPs may not be convened prior to the commencement of the 180-day arbitration period.

Copyright Owners argue that in order for precontroversy discovery to be in any way productive, the Copyright Office
rules must be amended to require the parties to a proceeding to exchange their direct cases prior to the commencement
of arbitration, as opposed to after a CARP has been convened. Copyright Owners, comments at 3&hyph;5, 7&hyph;10.
They assert that without an exchange of direct cases, precontroversy discovery would become a fishing expedition
as the parties attempt to guess at each other's theory of the case and principal evidence. Exchange of direct cases
would allow the parties to focus on the evidence that will be presented at a hearing and reduce the amount of time the
CARPs will need to devote to discovery matters.

We have carefully considered the views of the Copyright Owners with respect to precontroversy discovery, especially
in light of their request that the CARPs conduct precontroversy discovery and our earlier proposal set forth in the
NPRM. For reasons stated in the Interim Regulations, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
59 FR 23977, we do not believe that it is statutorily permissible to convene a CARP prior to the beginning of the 180-day
arbitration period for the purposes of conducting precontroversy discovery. We reaffirm our decision that the CARPs
cannot conduct or permit discovery prior to the beginning of the 180-day arbitration period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering the proposal of the Copyright Owners, however, we do think that it is appropriate that the Librarian
of Congress and the Copyright Office conduct some precontroversy discovery. We are therefore adopting a precontroversy
discovery procedure similar to that now being endorsed by the Copyright Owners and initially proposed in the NPRM.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We therefore amend &sect;251.45 of the rules to provide a procedure for conducting precontroversy discovery. New
paragraph (b) directs the Librarian to designate a 45-day period for the conduct of precontroversy discovery. The
Librarian shall designate the dates for the 45-day precontroversy discovery period on a case-by-case basis after
receiving and reviewing comments on the existence of controversies and notices of intention to participate described
in &sect;251.45(a). During this time period, the parties will exchange their written direct cases and the Librarian
will entertain motions and objections regarding discovery matters, motions and objections to dismiss any party's
royalty claim, motions for declaratory rulings or for procedural or evidentiary rulings, petitions to dispense
with formal hearings under &sect;251.41(b), and objections to arbitrators under &sect;251.4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

As stated in the Interim Regulations, ``[w]e agree with the Copyright Owners that precontroversy discovery before
the filing of written direct cases would not be productive.'' 59 FR 23977 (1994). The 45-day precontroversy discovery
period therefore shall begin with an exchange of written direct cases among the parties to the proceeding. Each party
must serve one complete copy of their written direct case on each of the parties to the proceeding no later than the first
day of the 45-day period. At any time during the 45-day period, the parties may file their motions and objections with
the Librarian. Objections to any and all motions will be due seven days after the filing date for motions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 45-day designated period shall be the sole time for filing precontroversy motions and objections. Any motions
and objections received prior to, or after, the 45-day period will be returned. The Librarian will rule on motions
and objections after the 45-day period has ended and prior to the declaration of the existence of a controversy. However,
motions for production of documents or to compel production of evidence should be ruled upon by the Librarian within
five days of receipt of the motion so as to expedite the discovery process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the exchange of direct cases and the filing of motions and objections, the Librarian will set the date
on which controversies will be declared. We agree with Copyright Owners that fixing a date certain for declaration
of controversies and initiation of arbitration proceedings will allow potential arbitrators and participating
parties to clear their schedules, as well as afford the participating parties more time to prepare their cases.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

record as to the petitioner's significant interest and receiving notices of intention to participate, and after
the period described in &sect;251.63(a), the Librarian will issue a precontroversy discovery scheduling order
identical to that for distribution proceedings. The Librarian will require exchange of direct cases, conduct the
one round of motions and objections, issue appropriate rulings, and announce the date on which initiation of arbitration
proceedings will begin.

The determination of ``significant'' interest is not required for the noncommercial educational broadcasting

We believe that these precontroversy discovery and scheduling regulations should provide a workable solution to
the time pressures of distribution and rate adjustment proceedings, and should sharpen the focus of the proceedings
by eliminating much of the preliminary work that would be faced by the CARPs without such procedures. We agree with
the Copyright Owners that 17 U.S.C. 801(c), coupled with Chairman Hughes' floor statement regarding precontroversy
discovery, provides ample statutory authority for the Librarian and the Copyright Office to conduct precontroversy
discovery and issue rulings. It may be that, with some issues, the Librarian will designate the issue raised during
the 45-day precontroversy discovery period to the appropriate CARP for disposition, but it is our belief that the
Librarian will be able to dispose of most precontroversy discovery issues.

EIA supports the Copyright Office position for both section 1004(a)(3) royalty maximum adjustment and section 1010
arbitration. EIA notes that section 801 of the Copyright Act contains no reference to royalty maximum adjustments
or section 1010 arbitration, and that the Copyright Office correctly observed that the former Copyright Royalty
Tribunal's duty to ``carry out its other responsibilities under chapter 10'' was expressly repealed from section
801 in the CRT Reform Act. EIA, comments at 2. Absent jurisdictional authorization, EIA argues that section 1010 is
outside the scope of the CARPs. Furthermore, EIA notes that CARP procedures are inconsistent with section 1010 arbitration;
a petition initiates CARP rate adjustments whereas agreement of the parties is necessary to initiate section 1010
arbitration.

royalty rate adjustments and distributions.

The Copyright Office reaffirms the conclusion announced in the Interim Regulations that proceedings under sections
1004(a)(3) and 1010 are not within the jurisdiction of the CARPs. 59 FR 23967 (1994). Proceedings to adjust the royalty
maximum under section 1004(a)(3) shall therefore be handled solely by the Librarian, and proceedings under section
1010 shall not be subject to the rules and regulations governing the CARPs. It may be that an arbitration panel convened
under section 1010 chooses to use some or all of the rules applicable to CARP proceedings; that choice, however, is
up to the arbitration panel.

With respect to the division of costs among the parties participating in a section 1004(a)(3) or section 1010 proceeding,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The issue of the costs involved in the entire CARP process was understandably a serious concern of a number of commentators.
These concerns included the payment and fees charged by arbitrators, deductions from royalty pools, and billing
cycles for arbitrators. The commentators offered some unique solutions to these problems, some of which we are adopting
in these Final Regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 251.54, 251.65 and 251.74 are the principal regulations governing the costs of CARP proceedings.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 251.54 directs the CARP panels in the case of rate adjustment proceedings to establish each participating
party's share of the costs of the proceeding. In the case of distribution proceedings, each participating party's
cost is in direct proportion to its share of the distribution. Sections 251.65 and 251.74 allow the Library of Congress
and the Copyright Office to recover their respective costs for rate adjustment and distribution proceedings. For
rate adjustments, the Librarian and Office may deduct their reasonable costs from the relevant royalty pool. If no
such pool exists, then the participating parties' costs shall be assessed directly to them. In distribution proceedings,
reasonable costs may be deducted directly from the relevant royalty pool.

A. Assessment of Arbitrator Costs in Distribution Proceedings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We concluded in the Interim Regulations that we did not have the authority to deduct the costs of the CARPs from the relevant
royalty pool, and could only deduct our costs. We noted that this was an unsatisfactory result, and described our effort
to have Congress amend the statute. 59 FR 23977 (1994). Our proposed statutory amendment would allow the Librarian
and the Copyright Office to deduct a CARP's costs from the relevant royalty pool, and pay the arbitrators with such
deductions, before the fees were distributed to copyright claimants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copyright Owners noted a problem with our proposal, specifically the provision which provided that deductions would
be made ``before the fees are distributed to any copyright claimants.'' Copyright Owners submit that this sentence
could be interpreted as suggesting that all royalty fees must remain on deposit until the final deduction for the costs
of a CARP proceeding has been made. Such an interpretation, they argue, ``would contradict the authority to make partial
distribution as found elsewhere in the statute and present a serious hardship to Copyright Owners because of the potential
long delay between collection of royalty fees and their distribution after an arbitration hearing.'' Copyright
Owners, comments at 35. They therefore recommend that the provision be amended to read ``Such deduction shall be made
before the fees are fully distributed to all copyright claimants.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aside from the legislative solution, the commentators offer other ways for handling the payment and costs of the CARPs.
Copyright Owners offer a unique proposal: make a substantial partial distribution of royalties at an early stage
of each distribution proceeding to an escrow account administered jointly by all of the claimants. The sole purpose
of the escrow account would be to make funds available for timely payment of monthly CARP member billings, while avoiding
the need for advance cash outlays from the claimants. Copyright Owners, comments at 33. Further partial distributions
to the escrow account could, if necessary, be made during the proceeding, and any excess remaining after all CARP bills
are paid could be distributed in accordance with the final distribution determination.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RIAA/AARC generally supports the proposed escrow account, but expresses concern that in DART proceedings, the escrow
account could be depleted by monthly CARP payments before the end of the proceeding. RIAA/AARC also points out that
monthly payments in a DART distribution proceeding are problematic since there has not yet been a DART distribution
decision and there is no precedent to follow for division of royalties among the claimants and each claimant's pro
rata share of expenses. RIAA/AARC, reply comments at 2&hyph;3. RIAA/AARC therefore recommends that the Copyright
Office deduct all CARP expenses from the royalty pool at the end of a distribution proceeding, citing 17 U.S.C. 802(h)(1)
and 802(c) as providing the Office with authority to make such deductions. RIAA/AARC, comments at 5. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The method of payment of the CARPs is a problem, especially given our lack of statutory authority to pay the arbitrators
directly. Unfortunately, the legislative solution discussed in the Interim Regulations, 59 FR 23977, failed for
this Congress. Thus, we cannot pay the CARPs. We will seek the necessary statutory authority in the 104th Congress.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of our lack of authority in this area, we are not adopting any regulations governing the method of payment of
CARP costs. As discussed above, the Copyright Owners proposed the creation of an escrow account, administered by
the parties, to pay the arbitrators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compensation of the arbitrators is the responsibility of the parties to a proceeding. 17 U.S.C. 802(g). If Copyright
Owners wish to establish such an escrow account, and can obtain the consent of all parties to the proceeding, they are
free to do so. We note that in the proceeding to adjust royalty rates for the section 119 satellite carrier license in
1991, the parties paid an upfront sum to those arbitrators to begin the proceeding, and a final payment at the conclusion
of the proceeding. We offer no opinion as to whether this is the appropriate manner in which to proceed, but offer it
as a possibility to be considered by the CARPs who have the authority to direct the ``manner and proportion'' of payment
of a CARP's costs.

B. Assessment of Library of Congress and Copyright Office Costs in Rate Adjustment Proceedings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 251.65 of the Interim Regulations allows the Library and Copyright Office to deduct their costs in rate adjustment
proceedings from the ``relevant royalty pool,'' and, if no such pool exists, to assess the costs directly to the parties
to the proceeding. RIAA/AARC and Copyright Owners oppose deductions from royalty pools for rate adjustment proceedings.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RIAA/AARC submits that &sect;251.65 is contrary to the intent of the CRT Reform Act. They note that 17 U.S.C. 802(h)(1)
provides for assessment of costs directly to parties where ``no royalty pool exists from which [the Library and Copyright
Office's] costs can be deducted_i.e. a rate adjustment proceeding.'' Thus, according to RIAA/AARC, deductions
can only be made from royalty pools in distribution proceedings and not in rate adjustment proceedings. RIAA/AARC,
comments at 10&hyph;11. Furthermore, if costs are deducted from the relevant royalty pool for rate adjustment proceedings,
then copyright owners will bear the entire brunt of the proceeding in contradiction to the Office's determination
that both owners and users should share the cost of rate adjustments.

Copyright Owners believe that a portion of the costs of a rate adjustment could be deducted from a royalty pool, but
submit that it is difficult to identify exactly what is the ``relevant'' royalty pool. Copyright Owners, reply comments
at 1&hyph;2. Rate adjustment proceedings involve the setting of rates for future, not-yet-collected royalty funds.
The ``relevant'' pools would therefore be the future funds affected by the rate change, rather than past funds. Copyright
Owners submit that the Office should therefore seek the comments of the owners as to what is the proper meaning of the
word ``relevant.''

 at 5. Furthermore, Copyright Owners argue that it is completely unfair for owners to bear all of the Office's expenses
for rate adjustments, since users clearly benefit as well from the adjustments. They ask that the Office reinstate
the deduction rule proposed in the NPRM which simply provides that rate adjustment costs will be assessed ``directly
to the parties participating in the proceedings.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at 6 (citing 59 FR at 2565 (1994)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We agree that RIAA/AARC and Copyright Owners raise valid points with respect to &sect;251.65. As we stated in the Interim
Regulations, we believe that the burden of the Library and Office's costs in a rate adjustment proceeding should be
shared by both owners and users. We did not intend to place the burden solely on copyright owners, although it is arguable
that &sect;251.65 appears to do that very thing. We also agree with Copyright Owners' assessment that the ``relevant''
royalty pool is not clear; it would seem that it may be necessary to amortize the costs over a number of royalty pools.
In an attempt to solve these problems, we are therefore accepting Copyright Owners' suggestion of reinstating &sect;251.65
as proposed in the NPRM. The section therefore now reads: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with 17 U.S.C. 802(h)(1), the Librarian of Congress and the Register of Copyrights may assess the reasonable
costs incurred by the Library of Congress and the Copyright Office as a result of the rate adjustment proceedings directly
to the parties participating in the proceedings.

C. Frivolous Claims
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Both RIAA/AARC and Copyright Owners are concerned with the costs that may be generated by frivolous claimants to royalty
distributions. Section 251.54(a)(2) provides that CARPs may assess their costs in direct proportion to each party's
share of the distribution. Thus, a party who received 0% of the distribution would bear 0% of the costs, even though
the claim of that party may have contributed greatly to the costs of the other claimants. RIAA/AARC believes that every
party participating in a distribution proceeding should be prepared to bear some portion of the procedural costs,
regardless of whether or not it receives any portion of the royalty fund. RIAA/AARC, reply comments at 3. They recommend
that the Office adopt some type of participation fee for distribution proceedings, similar to that used by other government
agencies conducting proceedings. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Id.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at 4. In lieu of a participation fee, RIAA/AARC recommends that the CARPs be granted the discretion to allocate a share
of expenses of the proceeding to bad faith or frivolous claimants who receive little or no share of the distribution.

4&hyph;5. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copyright Owners echo RIAA/AARC's concerns regarding frivolous claims and the added costs associated with those
claimants. Copyright Owners, however, would resolve the problem by an amendment to the statute which they propose
the Copyright Office seek. Such an amendment would provide that ``upon a finding of bad faith or other frivolous or
vexatious conduct, the Librarian may allow a different allocation of costs of the proceedings as necessary to respond
to such conduct.'' Copyright Owners, comments at 38. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to costs in distribution proceedings, section 802(c) is quite clear in providing that ``the parties shall
bear the cost in direct proportion to their share of the distribution.'' 17 U.S.C. 802(c). No provision is made to charge
parties fees for participating in distribution proceedings, or assessing costs against parties for frivolous behavior
or claims. We cannot imply or interpret the statute to provide for such measures, nor are we prepared to seek an amendment
of the statute to allow the Librarian to make an assessment of a claimant's conduct or behavior and impose an additional
share of the cost of the proceedings against that party. Since the Librarian is only charged with handling matters
preliminary to the arbitration and reviewing the CARP's decision, the Librarian is not in a proper position to evaluate
the conduct of participants to a proceeding. There is no authority in the statute for the CARPs to change 17 U.S.C. 802(c)'s
direction to assess costs in direct proportion to each party's share of the distribution, nor is there authority for
the CARPs to sanction parties or individuals to a proceeding. The CARPs are, however, in the best position to assess
the conduct of the participants to a distribution proceeding. Deliberate misrepresentation to a CARP by a party or
individual to a proceeding will be referred by the Copyright Office to the Justice Department for possible prosecution
under the applicable provisions of title 18 of the United States Code.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Arbitrator Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 251.54(a) provides that a CARP may ``assess its ordinary and necessary costs'' to the participants to a proceeding.
NMPA/HFA urges the Office to adopt a mechanism for appealing the reasonableness of fees and expenses assessed. They
recommend creation of a procedure, although they do not describe what kind of procedure or when and how it could be invoked,
whereby the Librarian would be available in instances where the parties question the fees and expenses charged. NMPA/HFA,
comments at 4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are declining to adopt a fee review procedure at this time because we believe that the rules already contain adequate
safeguards. Section 251.38 governs billing and provides that ``[a]rbitrators are bound by the hourly or daily fee
they proposed to the Librarian of Congress when their names were submitted to be listed under &sect;251.3, and shall
not bill in excess of their proposed charges.'' 59 FR 23986 (1994). Subsection (b) further provides that ``[a]rbitrators
shall not charge the parties any expenses in addition to their hourly or daily charge.'' The safeguards in these rules
are reinforced by the agreement the arbitrators must sign stating they will abide by the terms of these Final Regulations
including ``the billing restrictions specified in this subpart.'' &sect;251.38(e). The regulations already contain
substantial provisions to assure that arbitrators not charge excessive rates or expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although our regulations do not specifically address the number of hours for which an arbitrator can charge, we expect
that the arbitrators will be fair and charge for the actual amount of time they devoted to the proceedings. In some cases,
the amount spent may be more or less for one arbitrator than it is for another. Should an arbitrator charge for an unreasonable
number of hours that could not possibly bear any relationship to the amount of work performed, we believe that such
action would amount to an ethical violation subject to the remedies of &sect;251.39. We do not, however, intend to
judge or measure the amount of time it should take an arbitrator to perform a specific task, and we therefore decline
to create a billing review procedure.

VII. Final Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following is a section-by-section summary of the amended regulations, together with a discussion of the applicable
comments on the corresponding provisions of the Interim Regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Part 251_Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels Rules of Procedure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Part 251 contains most of the rules and procedures governing the operation of the CARPs and, like the rules proposed
in the NPRM, received the greatest number of observations and suggestions from the commentators. It is divided into
seven subparts, identified as subparts A through F. Subpart A, entitled ``Organization,'' describes the composition
and selection process for the CARPs. Subparts B and C, ``Public Access to Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel Meetings''
and ``Public Access to and Inspection of Records,'' remain virtually the same as those adopted in the Interim Regulations,
with only a few minor amendments. Subpart D, ``Standards of Conduct,'' prescribes the financial and ethical requirements
for arbitrators, and governs 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 communications, billing, sanctions for misconduct, and other matters involving ethical standards. Subpart E,
``Procedures of Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels,'' prescribes the procedures to be followed by the CARPs in
conducting proceedings, including those governing submission of evidence, conduct of hearings, reports of the
CARPs, and orders of the Librarian. Subparts F and G,'' Rate Adjustment Proceedings'' and ``Royalty Fee Distribution
Proceedings,'' provide certain additional requirements inherent in rate adjustment and distribution proceedings.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have already described most of the major issues raised by the commentators to the Interim Regulations and discussed
our responses and amendments. The following summarizes other additions and changes to the Interim Regulations in
the various subparts of part 251. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->

Arbitrator lists. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 251.3 describes the information that must be submitted to the Librarian by an arbitration association for
each person to be eligible to serve on a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel. Section 251.3(a)(5) requires ``a description
or schedule detailing fees proposed to be charged by the person for service on a CARP.'' James Cannings submits that
the proposed fees ``should reflect the current market daily or hourly rate as are charged by arbitrators who serve
National Arbitration Associations, such as, the Arbitration Association of America.'' Cannings, comments at 2.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For reasons stated above in the discussion of our rejection of a fee schedule, it is not appropriate for the Librarian
or the Copyright Office to impose fee restrictions on persons seeking to be arbitrators. Although the fee information
provided by a potential arbitrator will have a bearing on his or her selection, we decline to amend &sect;251.3(a)(5)
to adopt fee limitations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Qualifications of the arbitrators.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As was the case with the comments filed in response to the NPRM in this rulemaking proceeding, Copyright Owners had
disparate opinions regarding the requirement in &sect;251.5 that all CARP arbitrators be admitted to the practice
of law. Program Suppliers filed a separate comment in response to the Interim Regulations devoted solely to arguing
that the Librarian should also consider non-lawyers in the selection process, while other copyright owners identified
as Certain Copyright Owners filed a separate comment urging that the Copyright Office retain the requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program Suppliers advance essentially the same argument, which they made in response to the NPRM, that allowing non-lawyers
as arbitrators could prove invaluable in expediting the arbitration process: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In reaching its ruling, the Office ignored the important value that non-lawyers with expertise in the types of statistical
and economic studies that comprise the heart and body of distribution and rate adjustment evidence could bring to
the decisionmaking process. Having arbitrators who are familiar with statistical and economic studies similar
to those presented in prior rate adjustment and distribution proceedings would give each panel added competence
to deal with the substantive issues raised, and thus assist the decisionmaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is ironic, to say the least, that the Office's ruling was based on a concern about the lack of time for non-lawyers
to learn the nuances of legal rulings, but ignored the possibility that lawyer-arbitrators might have absolutely
no familiarity with the type of complex studies presented by expert witnesses over and over again in prior distribution
and rate adjustment hearings. Although legal rulings can affect certain aspects of a hearing, interpretation and
understanding of the conflicting substantive evidence is crucial to reasoned final determinations setting rates
or distribution royalties.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Program Suppliers, comments at 2&hyph;3. Program Suppliers believe that retaining subsection (c) of &sect;251.5
requiring arbitrators to have ``[e]xperience in conducting arbitration proceedings or facilitating the resolution
and settlement of disputes'' would satisfactorily provide the potential arbitrator with the type of experience
necessary to conduct arbitration proceedings.

Certain Copyright Owners argue that Program Suppliers' arguments have already been rejected in the Interim Regulations,
and that Program Suppliers fail to make any showing that ``the list already developed will fail to yield at least three
Panel members who are capable of resolving royalty disputes in a fair and efficient manner.'' Certain Copyright Owners,
reply comments at 2. Certain Copyright Owners believe that economic expertise is not necessary, and might cause an
undue bias among the panel members.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Copyright Office has reconsidered the lawyer requirement imposed by &sect;251.5 and reaffirms its decision
to retain the requirement. It appears that Program Suppliers are not so much concerned with allowing non-lawyers
to serve on CARP panels as they are with seeing economists among the listed arbitrators. Section 251.5 in no way prevents
economists or those with economic training from serving on a CARP, provided that they are admitted to the practice
of law. Furthermore, we agree with Certain Copyright Owners' observation that Program Suppliers have failed to demonstrate
any deficiency in the quality of experience of the potential arbitrators appearing on the current list. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
59 FR 24486 (1994). The listed arbitrators have diverse backgrounds and training, including economic expertise.
Moreover, all of the listed persons have experience in the practice of law which, given the shortness of the arbitration
period, is important in the efficiency and speedy disposition of CARP proceedings. The Copyright Office, therefore,
declines to make any changes to &sect;251.5. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

(2) Subpart B_Public Access to Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel Meetings

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
CARP Meetings. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Copyright Owners make several suggestions with respect to meetings of the CARPs. Because confidential proprietary
information is sometimes introduced into the record, it is necessary for the CARP to close a meeting for the purposes
of receiving that information. When confidential material is involved in only a limited portion of the meeting, it
is not necessary to close the entire meeting. The Interim Regulations, however, provide only for the closing of an
entire meeting. Copyright Owners therefore suggest that &sect;&sect;251.11(b) and 251.13 be amended to make clear
that a CARP may close only that part of a meeting during which confidential information is discussed; all other portions
of the meeting, however, would be open. Copyright Owners, comments at 26. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copyright Owners also note that because it is often impossible to determine when and if confidential information
may be disclosed at a meeting, it may be impossible to give the seven-day advance notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 required by &sect;251.11(b). Copyright Owners therefore suggest that a general notice of the possibility of the
introduction of confidential information during the course of a hearing should suffice to meet the notice requirements
even though it would be impossible to provide a specific date and time of the closed portion of the meeting. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Id. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another issue raised by Copyright Owners is the treatment of a CARP's internal deliberations. According to Copyright
Owners, a literal reading of Subpart B would apply to confidential deliberations among CARP arbitrators. ``Thus,
for example, if the members of a CARP want to talk over an objection to testimony during the course of a hearing before
ruling on it, they would be obliged to have that discussion transcribed and to announce the fact of that confidential
`meeting' in the

at 26&hyph;27. Copyright Owners therefore propose that the procedures of &sect;&sect;251.14 and 251.15 be modified
so that (a) transcripts or minutes are not necessary for internal CARP deliberations, and (b) the procedures for closed
meetings in &sect;251.14 do not apply to such deliberations.

The points made by Copyright Owners are well taken. In order to allow CARPs to close only a portion of a meeting, as opposed
to an entire meeting, for the taking of confidential information and related material, we are amending &sect;&sect;251.11(b)
and 251.13 by adding the phrase ``any portion of a meeting.'' With respect to seven-day advance publication notice
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of a meeting that may be closed in part or in whole, we agree that a general notice of the possibility of the introduction
of confidential information should suffice to satisfy the notice requirements. The notice of publication in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 therefore shall, as a matter of policy, contain such a general statement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, with respect to the procedures required for closed meetings applying to CARP deliberations, we agree with
Copyright Owners that application of those procedures is neither desirable nor appropriate. We are therefore amending
&sect;251.14 by adding a new subsection (d) which provides that ``[t]he procedure for closed meetings in this section
and &sect;251.15 shall not apply to the internal deliberations of arbitrators carried out in furtherance of their
duties and obligations under this chapter.''

Financial conflict of interests. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When we originally proposed financial conflict of interest rules, our main concern was with their proper scope. Did
we propose rules that did not cover enough situations, and therefore miss some very real conflicts of interest, or,
on the other hand, did our proposed rules go too far, and eliminate qualified persons for inconsequential reasons?
In an effort to reach the proper scope, we not only proposed rules, but we also asked for comments on certain hypothetical
situations that went beyond the scope of our proposed rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Copyright Owners' response reflects the difficulty of drawing the proper line. While they offered opinions about
the hypothetical situations that indicated a belief that our proposed rules did not go far enough, ultimately they
did not ask to expand the rules, but proposed handling the gray area questions on a case-by-case basis, using the disclosure
procedure to the parties described in section 251.32(b)(2) as a method to decide whether the conflict is disqualifying.
The Copyright Owners stated: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Copyright Owners believe that decisions about the financial conflicts of potential arbitrators must be made on a
case-by-case basis, with no single application of the rules being dispositive on a specific case.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;.
The screening of arbitrators for any panel ought not to occur through rote application of the rules *&blank;*&blank;*
If the Librarian finds a question arising as to whether a conflict exists as to a particular arbitrator, further information
should be made available to the parties so that they may determine whether the person should be disqualified or whether
the potential conflict might be waived.

Copyright Owners, comments at 21. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree with the Copyright Owners that this is the proper approach. Therefore, we have not modified the scope of the
financial conflict of interest rules, but we have made a change in the disclosure rule, section 251.32(b)(2). Whenever
a potential arbitrator has a conflict of interest as defined by our rules and has indicated that he or she wants this
conflict to be disclosed to the parties, or whenever a potential arbitrator has an interest beyond the specified scope
of the rules which raises our concern, section 251.32(b)(2) provides we will list these interests anonymously in
an order issued to the parties to each upcoming proceeding at the time the Librarian establishes for precontroversy
motions, and we will request that the parties indicate within 30 days which conflicts or potential conflicts they
believe are disqualifying. For those interests within the scope of our conflict of interest rules, the indications
of the parties will be dispositive. For those potential conflicts outside of the scope of our conflict of interest
rules, the indications of the parties will aid the Librarian in his decision.

For example, arbitrator X has a spouse who is employed by one of the parties to the proceeding. Because that is a interest
within the scope of our rules, the response of the parties will be dispositive. That is, if any one of the parties objects,
arbitrator X may not serve. On the other hand, if arbitrator X has a parent who is employed by one of the parties, that
would be an interest outside of the scope of our rules. In that case, if one or more of the parties objects, that objection
will be taken into account when the Librarian makes his decision, but the objection will not automatically disqualify
arbitrator X.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There was, however, one area in which the Copyright Owners commented that the scope of the conflict of interest rules
was too broad. Section 251.31(d)(3) imputes the financial interest of the arbitrator's general partner to the arbitrator.
The Copyright Owners believe that section 251.31(d)(3) means that each potential arbitrator would have to inquire
of each of his/her general partners about their personal investments. The Copyright Owners consider this an unworkable
burden and doubt that any potential arbitrator would be influenced by the personal holdings of a general partner,
especially if that general partner's financial interest is unknown to the arbitrator. The Copyright Owners ask that
an exception to the rule on imputation of interests be made in the case of a general partner's personal financial holdings.
Copyright Owners, comments at 24&hyph;25. We agree, and section 251.31(d)(3) has been modified to reflect this exception.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ex parte communications. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In our proposed interim rules, distinctions were made among four classes of persons concerning ex parte communications:
(1) the Librarian of Congress and the Register of Copyrights, (2) the selected arbitrators, (3) the listed arbitrators,
and (4) the Library and Copyright Office personnel. In particular, we drew a distinction between selected arbitrators
who are subject to a total ban on contact between them and interested parties in their controversy, and listed arbitrators
who are not subject to a total ban on contact, but who may not communicate with any interested party about the merits
of any past, pending, or future proceeding relating to CARP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both the Copyright Owners and James Cannings state that they believe no distinction should be made between selected
and listed arbitrators, and that there should be a total ban on contact with all arbitrators. The Copyright Owners
argue for the highest standard concerning selected and listed arbitrators because of ``the substantial financial
interests at stake.'' The Copyright Owners, however, would mitigate the severity of a total ban to permit nonsubstantive
pleasantries between arbitrators and parties. Finally, the Copyright Owners note that the restrictions concerning
arbitrators are against contact with any interested ``party'' and would prefer that it be changed to ``person'' because
of what they believe to be the ambiguous meaning of the word ``party.'' Copyright Owners, comments at 15&hyph;18.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Having reviewed the comments of the Copyright Owners and James Cannings, we continue to believe that the distinction
between selected and listed arbitrators is valid. In any given year, 75 persons will be listed to be available to serve
as arbitrators. A total ban on contact with all 75 persons would be unworkable, and unfair to the persons offering their
services. For the remote chance of being selected, they would be giving up a degree of personal freedom, not for any
actual impropriety but for the avoidance of the appearance of impropriety. However, we believe it is fair and highly
necessary that listed arbitrators understand that they may not engage in any actual impropriety, that is, discuss
the merits of any royalty proceeding, past, present or future. This is a much narrower and more appropriately tailored
limitation on their activities. Once selected, the total ban on contact with the three selected arbitrators is essential.
It assures fairness to all parties by guaranteeing that no opportunity for influence can possibly occur. Procedural
requests of the selected arbitrators should be routed through Library or Copyright Office personnel who are assigned
to support the arbitrators.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We do agree, however, with the Copyright Owners' request that innocent pleasantries should not be subject to the total
ban, and that the word ``party'' should be changed to ``person'' to avoid any ambiguity. The changes to section 251.33
have been made accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Gifts and other things of monetary value. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In our interim rules, we make a distinction between selected arbitrators who are subject to a total ban on soliciting
or accepting gifts or any other thing of monetary value from an interested person, and listed arbitrators who may solicit
or accept gifts of less than $20 per occasion, and not more than $50 per year from any one source. We also provide that
a listed arbitrator may accept a gift beyond the $20&hyph;$50 limit where it is clear that the gift is motivated by a
family relationship or a personal friendship rather than the potential of the listed arbitrator to be selected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Copyright Owners and James Cannings believe that no distinction should be made between selected and listed arbitrators
and that they should all abide by a total ban on the soliciting or acceptance of any gift. The Copyright Owners state
that applying the total ban to listed arbitrators would ``reduce the perceived opportunities for influencing of
either listed or selected arbitrators.'' Copyright Owners, comments at 18. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Again, as stated above, we believe that the restrictions on the activities of listed arbitrators should be limited
to actual improprieties only, considering that they may never be selected. Requiring listed arbitrators to refuse
gifts no matter how small, and to avoid normal relations with existing friends and family simply to avoid the appearance
of impropriety is too great a restriction, and may result in various individuals refusing to participate. The exceptions
for nominally valued gifts and for gifts from existing friends and family were derived from the regulations issued
by the Office of Government Ethics, and represent their line-drawing for thousands of compensated government employees
who are in a position to confer a benefit on a private party (versus listed arbitrators who are neither compensated
nor in a position to confer a benefit). We do not believe that a lunch valued at less than $20 where no discussion of the
merits of any past, present or future proceeding takes place would result in the influencing of any listed arbitrator.
Consequently, the distinction between selected and listed arbitrators is retained in the final rules.

Post-arbitration employment restrictions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While we did not receive any comments on our rule against arbitrators being employed for three years by any party, person
or entity with a financial interest in the proceeding, we did receive a comment on the hypothetical we posed based on
this section. The hypothetical asked whether an arbitrator who has ruled on a cable rate adjustment may take a cable
system as a client afterwards if that cable system, although affected by the outcome, had neither participated in
the proceeding nor authorized anyone else to represent it. The Copyright Owners stated that they believed the arbitrator
could take the cable system as a client, but gave no reasons, and prefaced their answers to all the hypotheticals by
saying they were difficult to answer given the limited facts available. Copyright Owners, comments at 22, 24. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe that since we received only one limited comment on this hypothetical, we do not have sufficient comments
to render a conclusion. We reserve judgment until an actual case presents itself. In the meantime, the rule is adopted
as proposed.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Remedies. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, section 251.39 provides sanctions against selected arbitrators, listed arbitrators, and outside parties
who violate the standards of conduct. The Copyright Owners argue that sanctions should also be put in place for Library
and Copyright Office personnel who violate the standards. Copyright Owners, comments at 24. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Library of Congress Regulations (LCRs) already set forth sanctions for Library and Copyright Office personnel who
violate internal personnel rules. LCR 2023&hyph;1 instructs all staff members to avoid actions which might result
in or create the appearance of using public office for private gain, giving inequitable and improper preferential
treatment to any person to the prejudice or detriment of others, or compromising the independence or impartiality
of the Library. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe this applies to the rules on ex parte communications, and would cover any disclosure of nonpublic information,
even though section 251.37 only applies to arbitrators. In addition, however, the Library's General Counsel, who
serves as the agency's ethics officer, has issued a memorandum that will be circulated to all personnel likely to have
any interaction with a CARP detailing the new situations that could arise and how employees should respond to them.

(i) Phase I/Phase II. In the preamble text to the Interim Regulations, we asked several questions with regard to the
procedural division of royalty distribution proceedings. The Copyright Royalty Tribunal traditionally divided
distribution proceedings into two phases: Phase I determined the percentage allocation among the categories of
claimants, while Phase II resolved disputes within a claimant category. The Tribunal practice, however, was just
that, and was never embodied in the rules. We sought comment on the following:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Is the procedure of dividing a cable distribution proceeding into Phases I and II a precedent that is binding on the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If not, should it nonetheless be followed? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If it should be followed, should we adopt rules governing the procedure? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Should those rules include a definition of each of the Phase I categories?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Copyright Owners urge that, regardless of the binding effect of the former Tribunal's practice on the Office, the
division of proceedings into Phase I and Phase II should continue in order to prevent chaos in the distribution process.
Copyright Owners, comments at 13. They note that Phase I claimant categories offer two primary benefits to the distribution
process. First, by allowing each claimant category to collect the total royalty awarded to it and distribute that
total to its individual claimants, the ``process frees the Copyright Office from the expense of mailing hundreds
of distribution checks to individual claimants each time a distribution is made.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Copyright Office believes that the division of distribution proceedings into Phase I and Phase II categories
provides an efficient manner for conducting such proceedings, and therefore will retain the use of the categories.
In dividing distribution proceedings into Phase I and Phase II categories, we will look to Tribunal precedent for
guidance, as well as the exigencies of each individual case. For these reasons, we do not believe that it is necessary
to adopt separate procedures for Phase I and Phase II proceedings, as is suggested by Copyright Owners. The Copyright
Royalty Tribunal functioned for fifteen years without separate rules for each type of proceeding, and exercised
its discretion to divide each distribution into Phase I and Phase II categories on a case-by-case basis. The procedural
rules of the subchapter applicable to distribution proceedings apply with equal basis to each controversy, regardless
of whether it is Phase I or Phase II, and therefore do not require separate sets of rules. Furthermore, it is the Librarian
who shall determine the number and category of controversies in each distribution proceeding, and submit each controversy
or controversies to one or more CARPs as is appropriate. Copyright Owners are therefore correct in their assertion,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 comments at 14&hyph;15, that the nature and extent of controversies in one royalty distribution proceeding may require
the convocation of more than one CARP for resolution. Thus, for example, a CARP may be convened to resolve controversies
in Phase I, and another may be required at a later date to resolve controversies in Phase II. The only way to make such
determinations is on a case-by-case basis, as was done by the former Tribunal, and the Office therefore heeds the advice
of Copyright Owners by declining to adopt rules governing the identification and classification of Phase I/Phase
II procedures which could ``create unnecessary rigidity that would fail to accommodate changing conditions.''
Copyright Owners, comments at 15. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Copyright Office also accepts Copyright Owners' suggestion of allowing parties to a proceeding to stipulate
the definitions of Phase I categories and programs to the arbitrators in that proceeding. In order to allow arbitrators
a sufficient amount of time to become familiar with the definitions, the Librarian will, in the notice establishing
the 45-day precontroversy discovery period, instruct the parties to the proceeding to stipulate a complete set of
definitions by the end of the precontroversy discovery period. If the parties are unable to reach agreement by that
date, the Copyright Office will, in accordance with our authority to provide support to the CARPs under 17 U.S.C. 801(d),
provide the arbitrators with the necessary definitions of Phase I categories and programs to allow them to accomplish
their task. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Paper proceedings. Section 251.41(b) permits the parties to a proceeding to petition the Librarian to have their
controversy decided solely on the submission of written pleadings. The petition may be granted if ``(1) there is no
genuine issue as to any material fact, or (2) all parties to the controversy agree with the petition.'' 59 FR 23976 (1994).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copyright Owners believe that &sect;251.41(b)(2) is in need of clarification. They note: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
As currently drafted, Section 251.41(b)(2) allows rulings only in uncontested cases where ``all parties to the controversy
agree with the petition.'' Of course, if all parties agree with the petition, then there would be no need for a ruling.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copyright Owners believe that Section 251.41(b)(2) was intended to allow ruling where all parties agree 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
with the request 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
that the issue be decided by petition, regardless of whether they agree with the merits of the petition. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Copyright Owners' point is well taken. The intention of the rule is to allow the parties to a proceeding to petition
the Librarian and dispense with formal proceedings. The CARP panel would then decide the controversy or rate adjustment
on the basis of written pleadings only, i.e., a ``paper'' proceeding. In deciding whether to allow a paper proceeding
before a CARP, the petition must demonstrate that (1) there is no genuine issue of material fact involved in the proceeding
(not the petition), or else 2) the parties unamimously agree that they wish to have a paper proceeding. If either one
of these factors is properly represented in the petition, the Librarian may (not must) grant the petition, or can designate
the issue of whether a paper proceeding would be proper to the CARP. Section 251.41(b)(2) is only intended to allow
the Librarian to decide if a paper proceeding before a CARP would be appropriate; it is not designed to allow the Librarian
to decide the merits of a paper proceeding or the case. To clarify the intention of the rule, we are amending it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Conduct of hearings: Role of arbitrators. Section 251.46(b) provides that ``Only the arbitrators of a CARP, or
counsel as provided in this chapter, shall question witnesses.'' James Cannings argues that the rule, as drafted,
precludes parties from appearing 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro se 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
before the CARPs, since only the CARPs and ``counsel'' can question witnesses. Cannings, comments at 2.

but only on issues affecting its particular interests, provided that the questioning is not repetitious or cumulative
of the questioning of other parties within the group.

Copyright Owners believe that, as currently drafted, the subsection ``seems to require that all parties with a similar
interest accede to a single counsel for examination or cross-examination of all witnesses. It is unlikely that parties
would agree to such a broad transfer.'' Copyright Owners, comments at 32. Copyright Owners therefore suggest that
the phrase ``of any given witness'' be added each time after the word ``cross-examination'' to clarify that agreements
between parties of similar interest to utilize one representative for questioning applies only to individual witnesses,
and not across the board for an entire proceeding.

parties with similar interest to agree to one representative for examining and cross-examining either one witness
or as many as the agreement allows. Nevertheless, in the interest of clarity, we are adopting Copyright Owners' suggested
amendment.

 In our discussion of &sect;251.49 in the Interim Regulations, we solicited comments on whether the hearing sessions
should be recorded on video as well as audio tape. We noted that videotaping would add to the cost of the proceeding,
but it would also:

Copyright Owners are opposed to the videotaping of proceedings, arguing that they ``do not believe that any advantage
derived from videotaping would be worth the considerable expense and difficulty associated with video recording.''
Copyright Owners, comments at 29. They also note that videotaping ``could, in fact, have the unintended and perverse
effect of increasing the number of hearing days missed by an arbitrator who considers seeing a taped performance as
equivalent to being present during the live presentation.''

(i) Settlement period. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 251.63 provides a 30-day period before commencement of a rate adjustment proceeding to allow for consideration
of the rate adjustment petition and, more significantly, to give the parties an opportunity to settle their differences.
We are amending this section to make it clear that the Librarian shall designate this 30-day period prior to, and separate
from, the 45-day period for precontroversy discovery. We are also amending &sect;251.64 to reflect that the arbitration
proceedings will commence after both the 30-day period for settling rate differences, and the 45-day period for precontroversy
discovery.

 and Copyright Owners believe that in the case of a universal settlement a CARP would have no authority over a proceeding.
The Office would therefore be responsible for amending the rules, after a public notice-and-comment period, to reflect
the agreed upon rate. RIAA/AARC, comments at 8; Copyright Owners, reply comments at 6. RIAA argues that the CARPs'
authority is limited to controversies over royalty rates; if there is no controversy because there has been a settlement,
then there is no CARP authority. RIAA/AARC, comments at 8&hyph;9 [(citing our NPRM, 59 FR 2553 (1994)]. Copyright
Owners note that convening a CARP after settlement has been reached ``would make no sense'' and ``would subject the
owner/user participants to needless expense.'' Copyright Owners, reply comments at 6&hyph;7. A public notice-and-comment
period ``should provide the Librarian with an adequate record on which to determine whether to amend the regulations
consistent with the terms of the settlement.''

NMPA/HFA believes that the rules should provide the parties to a rate adjustment proceeding with the option of either
having a CARP convened, or submitting the agreed upon rate to a public notice-and-comment proceeding. NMPA/HFA,
comments at 2. NMPA/HFA believes that the statutory authority to provide such procedures ``can be fairly implied
from the Reform Act's direction that the Librarian adopt procedures and regulations relating to CARP proceedings
and the Reform Act's express grant of authority to the Librarian to make the final determination in rate adjustment
proceedings.''

We agree with Copyright Owners that it would make little sense to go through the time and expense of convening a CARP
solely for the purpose of approving a settlement agreement. Without deciding the issue of whether a CARP would have
jurisdiction in such cases, we are amending &sect;251.63 by adding a new subsection:

(b) In the case where a settlement is reached as to the appropriate royalty rate, the Librarian may, upon the request
of the settling parties, submit the agreed upon rate to the public in a notice-and-comment proceeding. The Librarian
may adopt the rate embodied in the proposed settlement without convening an arbitration panel, provided that no opposing
comment is received by the Librarian from a party with an intent to participate in a CARP proceeding.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Delivery of claims. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are amending &sect;252.4(a) to adjust for some of the difficulties faced by the Copyright Office in receiving cable
royalty claims on a timely basis. Unlike the CRT, the Copyright Office and the Library of Congress are large institutions
receiving a tremendous amount of mail each day, only a small percentage of which involves CARP matters. For the July
1994 filing period, we experienced difficulties with cable and satellite claims arriving at different locations
of the Library by many different means of delivery (U.S. mail, messenger service, private mail carrier delivery).
In order to assure that claims arrive during the statutorily prescribed time period, we are amending &sect;252.4(a)
to specify the two methods by which claims may be delivered to the Copyright Office. The first method is by mailing the
claim to the official CARP address with the U.S. Postal Service, proper postage attached, so that when the claim arrives
at the Copyright Office, it bears a July U.S. postmark. The second method is hand delivery to the Office of the Register
of Copyrights, located in Room 403 of the James Madison Building, 101 Independence Avenue SE., Washington, DC 20540,
during normal business hours in the month of July. Such hand delivery may be done by the claimant itself, or by the claimant's
agent, or by a private delivery carrier (ex. Federal Express, DHL, messenger service) or other such manner. Hand delivery
of claims to the mail receiving area of the Library of Congress, or to other locations in either the Library or the Copyright
Office, is not compliance with the regulation. Claims which are hand delivered to other locations in the Library or
Copyright Office will be dismissed if the Office cannot conclusively determine that the claim was physically located
on Library and/or Copyright Office premises during the month of July.

We discussed in the Interim Regulations the Copyright Owners' request that we allow July mailings from Canadian and
Mexican post offices. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 59 FR 23979 (1994). We declined the request, but stated that ``we invite them [Copyright Owners], and any other interested
parties, to provide further information and comments on the question.''

 Our request for further information emanates from our concern with compliance with the statute. The statutory requirement
for filing cable claims is clearly spelled out in 17 U.S.C. 111(d)(4)(A): ``During the month of July in each year, every
person claiming to be entitled to compulsory license fees for secondary transmissions shall file a claim with the
Librarian of Congress &blank;*&blank;*&blank;*'' The statute requires that the claim be with the Librarian during
the month of July, arguably meaning in his possession. However, we accept the submission of a claim to the U.S. Postal
Service, as statutorily sufficient, providing it bears a July U.S. postmark. The postmark is an acknowledgment that
the claim was validly tendered with the U.S. Government in the month of July. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Our concern with allowing Canadian and Mexican postmarks is that those marks would not necessarily prove compliance
with the statute. Neither the Canadian nor the Mexican postal service is part of the U.S. Government. Furthermore,
if we were to allow Canadian and Mexican postmarks, we would have to allow national postmarks from all countries, since
there are some copyright owners of cable retransmitted programming that do not reside in the United States, Canada
or Mexico. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copyright Owners and Canadian Claimants' desire for allowing Canadian and Mexican postmarks appears to be motivated
by the desire ostensibly to add a few more days to the claim period. We, however, agree with what the Tribunal said in
1989 when it adopted the July U.S. postmark requirement:

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Tribunal does not believe that our insistence that either a claim be received in our office during July or that it
bear a July U.S. postmark is too restrictive. The claim itself is easy to prepare. No government forms are necessary.
The information that is required can be put on one page. Further, the claimant has six months from the close of the calendar
year to prepare it, and the entire month of July to submit it to the Tribunal. Our proposed rule provides a bright line
test which should end all questions of fact regarding the timeliness of the claim.

Copyright Owners believe that this provision, as drafted, could cause some confusion. Copyright Owners, reply comments
at 8. They note that there are two receipts associated with certified mail_the one given the sender by the Post Office
and the one signed by the receptionist and returned to the sender_and that subsection (e) does not identify which receipt
is acceptable proof. Copyright Owners, however, state that our discussion of the provision in the Interim Regulations
makes it clear that either receipt would be acceptable.

Consistent with our decision concerning joint claims for cable and satellite carriers, &sect;259.3 is amended to
require that joint claimants to the DART fund include a list of all their joint claimants when the claim is filed, except,
as discussed above, the performing rights societies will receive no exemption from this requirement. Performing
rights societies will have to list the members and affiliates they have signed to represent in DART as part of their
filing a claim. As a result, the current &sect;259.3(d), which allows joint claimants to lump their claims together
after the claim period, and the current &sect;259.3(f) which provides that the Office may require the productions
of the list after the claim period ends, are deleted. As a practical matter, joint claimants who decide after the claim
period to join together will simply report to the Office that they have settled, and no need to consolidate their claim
exists. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, we amend &sect;259.5(a) regarding timely delivery of claims and accept the Copyright Owners' proposed
amendment of &sect;259.5(e) regarding the proving of mailed DART claims through the use of certified mail return
receipt requested.

(i) The Librarian shall publish a list detailing the conflicts of interest the listed arbitrators have offered to
disclose, and any other matters which, although outside of the scope of the restrictions of &sect;251.31, nevertheless,
in the view of the Librarian, raise sufficient concerns to warrant disclosure to the affected parties;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

If the objection is raised to a matter found to be outside the scope of &sect;251.31, the objection will be taken into
account when the Librarian makes his or her selection, but will not serve automatically to disqualify the arbitrator.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Copyright Office of the Library of Congress is waiving the rule that requires a performing rights organization
to have written authorization in order to represent its members and affiliates for 1993 and 1994 DART royalties in
the Musical Works Fund. At the same time we waive the rule, we seek comment on whether a performing rights society should
have separate, specific, written authorization from its members to collect DART royalties for its members or affiliates.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Parties that import and distribute in the United States or manufacture and distribute in the United States any digital
audio recording technology (DART), either a device or audio recording medium, must deposit royalties with the Copyright
Office under the Audio Home Recording Act (AHRA) for ultimate distribution to interested copyright parties. The
AHRA defines ``interested copyright parties'' as copyright owners and any association or other organization representing
them. 17 U.S.C. 1001(7). If the parties do not reach distribution agreements among themselves, copyright arbitration
royalty panels (CARPs), administered by the Library of Congress and the Copyright Office, determine what joint or
individual claimants receive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to qualify, copyright owners must file a claim in January or February of each calendar year for royalties collected
during the preceding year. 17 U.S.C. 1006(a)(2), 1007(a)(1). The DART Funds are divided into the Sound Recordings
Fund and the Musical Works Fund. This interim rule deals only with the Musical Works Fund.

II. Representation by Performing Rights Organizations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Until it was abolished on December 17, 1993, the Copyright Royalty Tribunal (CRT) prescribed the ``form and manner''
for filing DART claims. Copyright Royalty Tribunal Reform Act of 1993, Public Law No. 103&hyph;198, 107 Stat. 2304
(eliminating former Chapter 8 of 17 U.S.C.). Shortly after the October 28, 1992, enactment of the AHRA, an issue arose
concerning the filing of claims to royalties. That issue was the extent of proof that performing rights organizations
were required to present in order to demonstrate proper representation of their members and affiliates. The CRT invited
public comment in an Advance Notice of Rulemaking. 57 FR 54542 (Nov. 19, 1992). On January 29, 1993, the CRT adopted
a rebuttable inference that performing rights organizations represented their respective members and affiliates
(hereafter ``members'') in royalty proceedings. 58 FR 6441, 6444 (Jan. 29, 1993). The interim regulations also directed
the parties to file a report, by June 1, 1993, on the issue. Subsequently, on October 18, 1993, the CRT published final
regulations requiring such organizations to submit separate, specific, and written authorization to represent
their members. Notice Adopting Final Regulations to Implement the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992, 58 FR 53822 (Oct.
18, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 3, 1993, the performing rights organizations_the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers
(ASCAP), Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI) and SESAC, Inc. (SESAC) (hereafter Performing Rights Organizations) filed
with the CRT a petition to reopen for reconsideration the rulemaking proceeding that resulted in the CRT's final rule.
On December 3, 1993, the CRT officially held the petition in abeyance. Order, dated Dec. 3, 1993,

 CRT Docket No. 92&hyph;3&hyph;DART. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 17, 1993, the President signed into law the Copyright Royalty Tribunal Reform Act of 1993 (CRT `Reform
Act'). Effective immediately upon enactment, the CRT Reform Act eliminated the CRT and transferred its responsibilities
to ad hoc CARPs. The new act directed the Librarian of Congress to convene CARPs to adjust rates and distribute royalties.
See 17 U.S.C. 111, 115, 116, 118, 119, and chapter 10.

Following Congress' direction in the CRT Reform Act, the Copyright Office issued a notice adopting the full text of
the former CRT's rules and regulations on an interim basis. 58 FR 67690 (Dec. 22, 1993). We made only slight technical
changes to those rules, stating that we intended to review and revise them during the course of a future rulemaking.

 We then published proposed regulations that revised the adopted CRT rules to adapt them to the requirements of the
new CARP system. 59 FR 2550 (Jan. 18, 1994). We concluded that we were not a successor agency of the CRT, and that Congress
intended to establish an entirely new system. Therefore, the proceedings the CRT had begun but not concluded by the
effective date of the CRT Reform Act would not be taken up where they had been left, but would rather be begun anew under
the new CARP regime.

On February 15, 1994, the Performing Rights Organizations filed a comment with the Copyright Office seeking to reconsider
the rule, now adopted by the Copyright Office, that required separate, specific, written authorization from Performing
Rights Organization members. (

III. Petition for Inference of Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In commenting on our adoption of the CRT rule, the Performing Rights Organizations assert that the rule disenfranchises
the many writers and publishers who would otherwise be qualified to receive DART royalties. Following the CRT's interim
rule, the performing rights societies contacted their members. One wrote to each of its members that unless the members
notified the organization to the contrary, the organization would represent its member writers and publishers.
Subsequently, when the CRT later required separate, specific, written authorization, the Performing Rights Organizations
again attempted to contact more than two hundred thousand writer and publisher members in less than four months. Performing
Rights Organizations states that they have agreements with the major foreign performing rights organizations to
represent foreign writers and publishers whose works are exploited in the United States. They also assert that since
not all eligible claimants responded to the writing, a significant number of members may still have the impression
that the Performing Rights Organizations are representing their claims and that the CRT's final rule effectively
leaves these members without an avenue to present their claims.

 Comment 4 at 4&hyph;8. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Performing Rights Organizations also urge that even if the Copyright Office rejects the concept of a permanent
rebuttable inference, the rebuttable inference should extend through the 1993 DART distribution proceeding. Claims
for 1993 royalties were required to be filed during the months of January and February 1994. The Performing Rights
Organizations claim that even with the mass mailings following the Tribunal's final ruling, there was no practical
way to obtain all of the required signed written authorizations before the filing period expired. They also suggest
that the abolition of the CRT effectively disenfranchised the Performing Rights Organizations' members and affiliates,
since it eliminated their only forum for being reheard on this issue. The Performing Rights Organizations also contend
that further prejudice will result to their members and affiliates because of a private settlement, entered into
by all joint claimant groups and all but one of the individual claimants to the Musical Works Fund, that links distribution
of 1992 DART royalties, to which the rebuttable inference of agency applies, to the outcome of the 1993 proceedings,
to which the rebuttable presumption would not apply.

IV. Opposition for Reconsideration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Gospel Music Coalition and Copyright Management, Inc., oppose reconsideration of the issue. They believe the
matter has been amply briefed and settled by the CRT, and no new issues of fact or law have been raised. They oppose the
rebuttable presumption of agency and urge the Copyright Office not to disturb the final regulation. Reply Comment
10, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (94&hyph;1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Gospel Music Coalition and Copyright Management, Inc., note that the CRT's rationale for granting a temporary
inference of agency is no longer applicable, since the time pressures have been greatly eased. Moreover, they state
that since the CRT specifically ruled in January 1993 that the AHRA did not grant Performing Rights Organizations
special entitlement to make claims on behalf of their members more than a year remained until the end of the filing period.
They contend this was ample time to obtain the required authorizations from members. Furthermore, they argue that
all organizations had the same opportunity to obtain written authorizations from their members. They state that
if the Copyright Office adopts the rebuttable inference in favor of the Performing Rights Organizations, it will
give these organizations a benefit over other group claimants. Moreover, the Gospel Music Coalition and Copyright
Management, Inc., claim that the silence of members should not be considered as implied consent to representation
by a performing rights society, and that excusing the performing rights societies from obtaining separate, specific,
written authorizations to file claims grants these organizations preferential treatment.

V. Policy Decision and Request for Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Copyright Office has not considered this issue. Less than 30 days before the CRT Reform Act was enacted, the CRT
expressly ordered the Performing Rights Organizations' petition to reconsider to be held in abeyance. In our December
22 rule, we noted that we did not consider the Office to be a successor agency to the CRT. Therefore, matters pending
before the CRT would have to begin anew.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 9, 1994, we issued interim CARP regulations. At that time we noted that the Performing Rights Organizations'
comment serving as a petition to reopen was actually a petition for reconsideration of a pending CRT matter and that
we would consider it in a separate rulemaking proceeding. 59 FR 23964, 23966 (May 9, 1994). We are now addressing that
matter, and the Copyright Office requests comments on the issue of whether Performing Rights Organizations need
separate, specific, and written authorization to represent members and affiliates in collecting DART musical works
royalties. Any party who has already filed comments on this issue with the former CRT may simply incorporate those
comments by reference. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because we are reconsidering the rule, we are waiving the rule adopted at 37 CFR 259.2, and inferring an agency relationship
between the Performing Rights Organizations and their members for the 1993 and 1994 DART royalty distribution. This
rebuttable inference will be utilized solely for the purpose of filing claims for, and distribution of, 1993 and 1994
DART royalties payments. We include 1994 in the waiver of our rules because the parties have already sought and been
granted consolidation of 1993 and 1994 DART royalties. Therefore, it would be cumbersome to have different rules
for the consolidated proceeding. If a member files an individual claim or grants express authority to another agent,
such action will rebut the implied agency relationship. This action is without precedential value and shall not prejudice
the Copyright Office's ultimate determination of the issue.

 to provide the public with an opportunity to comment on USEPA's action. If a person submits adverse comments on USEPA's
proposed action within 30 days of publication of the proposed and direct final actions, USEPA will withdraw its direct
final action and will consider any comments received before taking final action on the State's submittal. Based on
the proposed full approval, USEPA is making an interim final determination by this action that the State has corrected
the deficiency for which a sanctions clock began on May 13, 1993. This action will defer the application of the offset
sanction and defer the application of the highway sanction. Although this action is effective upon publication,
USEPA will take comment. If no comments are received on USEPA's proposed approval of the State's submittal, the direct
final action published in this

rule taking into consideration any comments received.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 28, 1989 the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) submitted a revision to Wisconsin's SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP to USEPA, consisting of Wisconsin State Rule NR 418.07, for which USEPA published a final disapproval on May 13,
1993 (58 FR 28362). The USEPA's disapproval action started an 18-month clock for the application of one sanction (followed
by a second sanction 6 months later) under section 179 of the Clean Air Act (Act) and a 24-month clock for promulgation
of a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) under section 110(c) of the Act. The State subsequently submitted a revision
to its SIP for the Rhinelander, Wisconsin SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment area on October 21, 1994. The USEPA has taken direct final action on this submittal pursuant to its modified
direct final policy set forth at 59 FR 24054 (May 10, 1994). In the rules section of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

 nonattainment area SIP. In addition, in the proposed rules section of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

II. USEPA Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the proposed full approval set forth in this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, USEPA believes that it is more likely than not that the State has corrected the original disapproval deficiency that
started the sanctions clock and, therefore, USEPA is taking this interim final action finding that the State has corrected
the deficiency, effective on publication. This action does not stop the sanctions clock that started under section
179 for this area on May 13, 1993. However, this action will defer the application of the offset sanction and will defer
the application of the highway sanction. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 59 FR 39832 (August 4, 1994) to be codified at 40 CFR 52.31. If USEPA's direct final action fully approving the State's
submittal becomes effective, such action will permanently stop the sanctions clock and will permanently lift any
applied, stayed or deferred sanctions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The USEPA is also providing the public with an opportunity to comment on this final action. If based on any comments
on this action and any comments on USEPA's proposed full approval of the State's submittal, USEPA determines that
the State's submittal is not fully approvable and this final action was inappropriate, USEPA will take further action
to disapprove the State's submittal and to find that the State has not corrected the original disapproval deficiency.
As appropriate, USEPA will also issue an interim final determination or a final determination that the deficiency
has not been corrected. In addition, the sanctions consequences described in the sanctions rule will also apply.

III. Administrative Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because USEPA has preliminarily determined that the State has an approvable plan, relief from sanctions should be
provided as quickly as possible. Therefore, USEPA is invoking the good cause exception under the Administrative
Procedure Act (APA) in not providing an opportunity for comment before this action takes effect.

 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B). The USEPA believes that notice-and-comment rulemaking before the effective date of this action
is impracticable and contrary to the public interest. The USEPA has reviewed the State's submittal and, through its
proposed and direct final action, is indicating that it is more likely than not that the State has corrected the deficiency
that started the sanctions clock. Therefore, it is not in the public interest to initially impose sanctions or to keep
applied sanctions in place when the State has most likely done all that it can to correct the deficiency that triggered
the sanctions clock. Moreover, it would be impracticable to go through the notice-and-comment rulemaking on a finding
that the State has corrected the deficiency prior to the rulemaking approving the State's submittal. Therefore,
USEPA believes that it is necessary to use the interim final rulemaking process to temporarily stay or defer sanctions
while USEPA completes its rulemaking process on the approvability of the State's submittal. Moreover, with respect
to the effective date of this action, USEPA is invoking the good cause exception to the 30-day notice requirement of
the APA because the purpose of this action is to relieve a restriction. See 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(1).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS were monitored in Rhinelander, Wisconsin. On April 1, 1985 the State adopted Wisconsin State Rule NR 154.12(9),
which regulated certain sources of SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 constructed before April 1, 1985 located within the corporate boundaries of Rhinelander, Wisconsin. The Rhinelander
Paper Company (source), a paper mill, was the only source affected by the State Rule's limits. These limits proved
ineffective to protect the NAAQS after three more exceedances which were attributable to the source were monitored
in 1985. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 28, 1989 the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) submitted a revision to Wisconsin's SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP to USEPA, consisting of Wisconsin State Rule NR 418.07, to satisfy the requirements of section 110 and part D of
the Act for the Rhinelander nonattainment area. The SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 limits included in the State Rule are summarized in USEPA's January 5, 1993 (58 FR 326) notice of proposed rulemaking
(NPR). This rule was disapproved in final on May 13, 1993 (58 FR 28362), because the State had not shown that the rule
provided for attainment and maintenance of the SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS. After the 1993 final action of disapproval, USEPA notified the State of the commencement of sanctions clocks
due to the disapproval. Further discussion is found within the August 30, 1994 Technical Support Document (TSD) from
Sheila Breen to Gary Gulezian, the November 10, 1994 addendum to the TSD from Christos Panos to Gary Gulezian, and the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The latest SIP revision request dated October 21, 1994 includes Consent Order AM&hyph;94&hyph;38, effective August
22, 1994 and two letters (August 29, 1994 letter from WDNR to the source and an October 19, 1994 letter from the source
to WDNR), which clarify certain items found in the Order such as storage of test samples and definitions. This 1994
SIP revision request was submitted to fulfill the requirements of section 110 and part D, and to cure the deficiency
that led to the notification regarding sanctions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States are required to observe certain procedural requirements in developing implementation plans and plan revisions
for submission to USEPA. The Act provides that each implementation plan submitted by a State must be adopted after
reasonable notice and public hearing. The USEPA also must determine whether a submittal is complete and therefore
warrants further USEPA review and action. The USEPA's completeness criteria for SIP submittals are set out at 40 CFR
part 51, appendix V (1991), as amended by 57 FR 42216 (August 26, 1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of Wisconsin held a public hearing on September 13, 1994 to receive public comment on the implementation
plan for the Rhinelander SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment area. Following the public hearing, the plan was adopted by the State and signed by the Governor's designee
and submitted to USEPA on October 21, 1994 as a proposed revision to the SIP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SIP revision was reviewed by USEPA to determine completeness shortly after its submittal, and was found to be complete.
A letter dated November 8, 1994 was forwarded to the Director, WDNR, indicating the completeness of the submittal
and the next steps to be taken in the review process.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP meeting all of the applicable Part D requirements for the Rhinelander nonattainment area. The following discusses
how the submission complies with the pertinent provisions of section 172(c), which sets forth the requirements for
Part D SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIPs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(1) In General_The plan complies with the requirements to implement reasonably available control
measures by providing for immediate attainment of the SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS through the emission limits and operating restrictions imposed on the source by Consent Order AM&hyph;94&hyph;38.
By providing for immediate attainment, the plan also satisfies the requirements of section 192(b) that provide for
attainment by November 15, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(2) RFP_Reasonable further progress is achieved due to the immediate effect of the emission limits
and plantwide cap that is discussed within the plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(3) Inventory_An inventory of the actual SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions from the stoker and cyclone boilers has been provided and is found to be acceptable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(5) Permits for New and Modified Major Stationary Sources_Any new or modified sources constructed
in the area must comply with a State submitted and Federally approved New Source Review program. The State currently
has an approved Federally delegated program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(6) Other Measures_The plan provides for immediate attainment of the SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS through the emission limits and operating restrictions that are set forth within Consent Order AM&hyph;94&hyph;38.
By adhering to more stringent limits for the stoker boilers and presently setting an overall plantwide emission cap,
the area should continue to attain the SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(7) Compliance with section 110(a)(2)_This submission complies with section 110(a)(2). With respect
to section 110(a)(2)(K), under which USEPA generally requires modeling in the case of SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, USEPA notes that the Industrial Source Complex (ISC) model used by WDNR has been shown to underpredict ambient SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 concentrations in the Rhinelander area, especially on known exceedance days. Therefore, as described in more detail
below, in this instance, an alternative methodology using the rollback analysis was needed and has been used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(8) Equivalent Techniques_Since modeling attainment of the SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS is not achievable, an alternative methodology using the rollback analysis to set a plantwide emissions cap
was required. This is further discussed within the August 30, 1994 TSD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(9) Contingency Measures_A plan should be provided for the implementation of specific measures if
the area fails to make reasonable further progress (i.e., contingency measures), or to attain the primary NAAQS referenced
above. The State Implementation Plans; General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990 (General Preamble), which was proposed within the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 16, 1992, provides guidance on SIP requirements for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment areas. The General Preamble discusses contingency measures for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 controls that fail to attain the NAAQS. Therefore, USEPA interprets ``contingency measures'' for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to include the ability to rely on comprehensive State programs to identify sources of violations and to undertake
an aggressive follow-up program of compliance and enforcement. Wisconsin Administrative Code, State Rule NR 404.05(6)
dictates that the NAAQS may not be exceeded within the State of Wisconsin. Wisconsin State Rule NR 404.08(2) allows
the State to be more restrictive with emission limits than those prescribed within an implementation plan or air pollution
control rules where emissions cause or substantially contribute to exceeding an air standard in a localized area.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The USEPA notes that through the issuance of Consent Order AM&hyph;94&hyph;38, the State has used these rules in context
of the Rhinelander area SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 exceedances. These exceedances were determined to be the result of excess SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions from the Rhinelander Paper Company. The USEPA believes that the existence of these state rules and WDNR's
program to implement them satisfies the requirements of section 172(c)(9).

(C). Review of Technical Merits of Plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1). Emission Limits/Plantwide Cap: Due to ISC's apparent underprediction of ambient SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 concentrations, the State used the rollback analysis to determine appropriate emissions limits for the source.
A rollback analysis takes a monitored ambient exceedance recorded during a specific set of facility operating conditions
and determines the amount of the exceedance due to each of the source's SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emitting operations in use at that time. These estimates are then linearly ``rolled back'' to acceptable SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emission limits which provide for attainment of the NAAQS under that set of operating conditions (refer to 58 FR 326).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the time of the exceedance, the source was operating its cyclone boiler and only two of its five stoker boilers. A
rollback analysis only accounts for those operations that were running at the time of the exceedance. However, the
source requires the flexibility of using multiple scenarios of boiler operations for economic reasons. Therefore,
the source accepted an overall daily SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emission cap for the entire facility. This cap will assure protection of the SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS, while still allowing for operational flexibility. For further discussion on the rollback analysis, please
refer to the August 30, 1994 TSD.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

boilers, which requires additional sulfur testing of prior fuel if the current fuel is found to exceed 90 percent of
the enforceable SO

 emission limit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3). Monitoring: The source has agreed to conduct meteorological monitoring. The State will conduct additional
ambient monitoring, which USEPA requested for additional background information on local conditions. The original
hillside ambient monitor that recorded the original violations will be maintained indefinitely. No recorded exceedances
have been monitored since the last SIP revision request was submitted to USEPA on April 28, 1989.

III. Final Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because USEPA considers this action noncontroversial and routine, we are approving it without prior proposal. This
action will become effective on Februray 6, 1995. However, if we receive a notice of intent to comment by January 6,
1995, USEPA will publish a document that withdraws this action, and will address the comments received in the final
rule on the requested SIP revision, which has been proposed for approval in the proposed rules section of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

A. Applicability to Future SIP Decisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting, allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. The USEPA shall consider each request for a revision to the SIP in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order
12866 review.

C. Regulatory Flexibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. et seq., USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing
the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, USEPA may certify
that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include
small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations
of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This approval does not create any new requirements. Therefore, I certify that this action does not have a significant
impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the Act,
preparation of the regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness
of the State action. The Act forbids USEPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. Union Electric Co. v.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States
Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by February 6, 1995. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator
of this rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time
within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such a rule. This
action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (section 307(b)(2).)

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission adjusts the renewal schedule of FM radio and television (LPTV) stations to correspond with the renewal
schedule of full service radio or television stations operating in the same state. The Commission also eliminates
FCC Form 348 and revises FCC Form 303&hyph;S to include information requrest formerly included in Form 348. These
actions are intended to decrease the administrative and paperwork burden on those licensees who own full service
stations and LPTV or translator stations in the same but who must, under the current rules, file separate renewal application
on different dates for each station.

Synopsis of the Report and Order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Commission changes the license renewal dates of FM radio and television translator stations and low power television
(LPTV) stations licensed under Part 74 of the Commission's Rules, to coincide with those of full service radio or television
stations operating in the same state. The Commission also eliminates FCC Form 348, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Application for Renewal of a Low Power TV, TV Translator, or FM Translator Station License,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and revises FCC Form 303&hyph;S, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Application for Renewal of License for Commercial and Noncommercial Educational AM, FM and TV Broadcast Stations,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to include information requests formerly included in Form 348. These form revisions will permit translator stations
co-owned with primary stations in the same state which rebroadcast the signal of the primary station to file for license
renewal on a single application form with their primary station. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

2. The majority of parties commenting in response to the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Notice of Proposed Rule Making (MPRM)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 agreed with the Commission's initial view that conforming the renewal dates for full service and for FM and TV translators
and LPTV stations in the same state would streamline the license renewal process, eliminate paperwork burdens on
licensees and on the Commission, and simplify the renewal process for interested members of the public. By coordinating
the renewal cycles and merging the application forms, the Commission anticipates saving licensees who own both full
service stations and LPTV or translator stations in the same state, time spent in providing duplicate renewal information,
and avoiding confusion as to the correct renewal dates. These revisions should also save Commission staff resources
by reducing the likelihood of a licensee filing an application at the wrong time, which must then be returned by the
Commission.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
NPRM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 noted that the transition to a revised renewal schedule would entail a one-time additional burden on cerain LPTV and
translator stations whose license come up for renewal before those of the full service stations in their state. More
particularly, it would result in some LPTV and translator stations receiving short term renewals in order to synchronize
their renewal cycles with those of full service stations in their states. In order to allow such stations to file for
renewal coincident with the renewal dates of full service stations in the same states, the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
NPRM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 discussed alternatives that would would avoid this situation. The Commission rejected one option, to allow such
licensees to file for translator or LPTV renewal at their normal scheduled date, but with their next succeeding renewal
date set to correspond with those of full service stations in their state. This option was dismissed because some licenses
granted in this manner would run for a term beyond the maximum five or seven years (for TV and radio station licenses,
respectively) prescribed in Section 307(c) of the Communications Act.

4. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
NPRM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 suggested that, instead, such LPTV and translator stations could file for renewal twice during the transition period
to the new schedule, once at their normal renewal time (for a short term license) and again when the full service stations
in their states became due for renewal. This alternative would avoid conflict with Section 307(c), but concerned
some of the commenters because it would force some licensees to file for renewal in as short a period as eight months,
entailing additional administrative and cost burdens and providing additional opportunity for renewal challenges.
Such parties believe that the additional risks and burdens outweigh the benefits to be gained from allowing full service
station licensees to file full service, low power, and translator renewal applications at the same time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5 The Commission believes that substantial savings to the Commission, broadcasters, and the public can be realized
by conforming the renewal dates for translator and low power television stations to those for full service stations
of the appropriate service (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 radio or television) in the same state. We expect these savings to include a streamlined renewal process, the elimination
of needless paperwork burdens and a reduction in the incidence of filing errors. Accordingly, we will grant translator
and LPTV applicants filing for license renewal a short term renewal with the license period extending only until the
end of the license period for full service stations of the relevant type located in the same state; at that time they
will have to file again for a full term license renewal. The Commission recognizes that this action will require two
renewal applications to be filed by some translator and low power licensees within a brief period of time. However,
this is a modest, one-time cost that is more than counterbalanced by the long term savings that will accrue from the
synchronization of renewal schedules and consolidation of forms that this action will achieve. Additionally, the
Commission believes that the fear expressed by some commenters that accelerated renewal filings will be subject
to increased renewal challenges appears to be one more of perception than substance. Only 3 challenges to LPTV station
renewals were filed during the last renewal cycle (1991&hyph;1994); two of those were subsequently withdrawn. In
the 1988&hyph;1991 renewal cycle fewer than six challenges were filed against translator applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Although, as discussed in detail in the full text of this decision, there does not appear to be any way to avoid the
above-described one-time additional short term renewal for translators and LPTV stations located in some states
without violating either Section 307(c) or 309 of the Communications Act of 1934 as amended (the Act), to alleviate
the extra burden on some licensees, pursuant to Section 8(d)(2) of the Act, the Commission will waive the application
fees for any translator or LPTV license renewal application that is required by this action to be filed within 26 months
of the station's most recent prior renewal filing. In situations where full service stations must file for renewal
prior to translator and LPTV stations in their state, the Commission will permit but not require the translator and
LPTV stations to file an early renewal to place them on the same renewal schedule as full service stations in their state.
The Commission strongly encourages translators and LPTV stations to file coincident with the corresponding full
service stations for that state. By doing so, translator stations commonly-owned with primary stations in the same
state which rebroadcast the signals of the primary station can realize the benefit of filing for renewal on a single
application form in the upcoming renewal cycle as opposed to waiting until the following cycle. Licensees of translator
and LPTV stations that do not elect to take advantage of this option will be required to file for license renewal at the
time presently required by their license authorization. In this latter case, shorter term renewals will be issued
for periods to expire coincident with the expiration date for full service station licenses in that state.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. In a related matter, one commenter, the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) requests that the Commission,
in modifying FCC Form 303&hyph;S, include a certification that the applicant has complied with all relevant FM translator
rules, particularly those relating to funding and support. In amending the Form 303&hyph;S as a result of the instant
proceeding, the Commission will add to the form a certification related, but not identical, to that requested by NAB.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
8. Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 605, it is certified that this decision will have an
one time negative impact on some small television and FM radio translators and low power television stations. As detailed
in the full text of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Report and Order,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 low power television and FM radio and television translator licensees whose licenses expire before the renewal date
of their full service counterparts in the same state will have to file for renewal twice, once at their normal time and
once when the full service stations in their states are due for renewal. To alleviate this burden, the Commission will
waive the application fees for any translator or low power television license renewal application that is required
by this action to be filed within 26 months of the station's most recent prior renewal filing. The Commission believes
that the advantages of allowing FM and television translators and low power television licensees to file at the same
time as their full service counterparts in the same states outweigh the one time administrative burden necessary
to bring such stations into their full service counterparts' renewal cycle. The full text of the Commission's final
regulatory flexibility analysis may be found in paragraphs 11&hyph;13 of the text of the Commission's decision.

Section I_Fee Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
By law, the Commission is required to collect charges for certain of the regulatory services it provides to the public.
Generally, applicants seeking to renew the license for a commercial AM, FM, TV, FM translator, TV translator or Low
Power TV station are required to pay and submit a fee with the filing of FCC Form 303&hyph;S. However, governmental
entities, which include any possession, state, city, county, town, village, municipal organization or similar
political organization or subpart thereof controlled by publicly elected and/or duly appointed public officials
exercising sovereign direction and control over their respective communities or programs, are exempt from the payment
of this fee. Also exempted from this fee are licensees of noncommercial educational radio or television broadcast
stations. (This includes licensees of noncommercial educational FM and full service TV broadcast stations seeking
renewal of the licenses for their translator or low power TV stations 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
provided
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 those stations operate on a noncommercial educational basis. Low Power TV or TV translator stations that rebroadcast
the programming of a primary noncommercial educational station, but are not co-owned by the licensee of such a station,
are required to file fees. In addition, noncommercial FM translators operating on a non-reserved channel (CH 221&hyph;300),
and that are not co-owned by the licensee of the primary noncommercial educational station, are also required to file
fees.) Renewal applicants that earlier obtained either a fee refund because of an NTIA facilities grant for the stations
or a fee waiver because of demonstrated compliance with the eligibility and service requirements of 47 CFR 73.503
or 73.621, and that continue to operate those stations on a noncommercial basis, are similarly exempted from this
fee. See 47 CFR 1.1112. To avail itself of any fee exemption, the renewal applicant must indicate its eligibility by
checking the appropriate box in Question 2(B), Section I. FCC Form 303&hyph;S applications NOT involving the payment
of a fee can be hand-delivered or mailed to the FCC's Washington, D.C. offices. See 47 CFR 0.401(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The Commission's fee collection program utilizes a U.S. Treasury lockbox bank for maximum efficiency of collection
and processing. All FCC Form 303&hyph;S applications, which require the remittance of a fee, must be submitted to
the appropriate post office box address. See 47 CFR 0.401(b). A listing of the required fee and the address to which
FCC Form 303&hyph;S should be mailed or otherwise delivered is also set forth in the ``Mass Media Services Fee Filing
Guide'' which is obtained either by writing to the Commission's Form Distribution Center, 2803 52nd Avenue, Hyattsville,
Maryland 20871, or by calling Telephone No. (202) 418&hyph;FORM and leaving your request on the answering machine
provided for this purpose. See also 47 CFR 1.1104. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Payment of any required fee must be made by check, bank draft or money order payable to the Federal Communications Commission,
denominated in U.S. dollars, and drawn upon a U.S. financial institution. No postdated, altered or third-party checks
will be accepted. DO NOT SEND CASH. Checks dated six months or older will not be acceptable for filing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Parties hand-delivering FCC Forms 303&hyph;S may receive dated receipt copies by presenting copies of the applications
to the acceptance clerk at the time of delivery. For mailed-in applications, a ``return copy'' of the application
can be furnished provided the applicant clearly identifies the ``return copy'' and attaches it to a stamped, self-addressed
envelope. Only one piece of paper per application will be stamped for receipt purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This section must be completed and submitted by all applicants regardless of the service of the station for which renewal
is being sought. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Question 1. The name of the licensee applicant should be stated exactly as it appears on the station's existing license.
The current street address or post office box used by the applicant for receipt of Commission correspondence should
be set forth. If this information has been set forth in Question 1, Section I, it need not be repeated here. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Any change in the licensee's name, which does not involve a change in ownership requiring prior Commission approval,
can be communicated to the Commission by letter. To report any change in the mailing address previously used by the
licensee FCC Form 5072, entitled ``Change in Official Mailing Address for Broadcast Station,'' should be promptly
transmitted to the Commission. See 47 CFR 1.5. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Question 2. Applicants for AM, FM or TV stations should identify whether it has been licensed by the Commission as a
commercial or noncommercial educational licensee. A licensee that merely elects to operate its station on a noncommercial
basis is not considered to be a noncommercial educational licensee. The facility should be described by its service,
call letters, and specific community of license or area as listed on the station's existing license. See 47 CFR 74.1201(a),
74.701(a) and 74.701(f) for definition of an FM translator, TV translator and low power TV broadcast stations respectively.
For AM, FM or TV stations the location of the facility should be described in terms of the specific city or community
to which the station is licensed. Translator and Low Power TV stations should specify the area the stations are licensed
to serve. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Question 3. This question must be completed by a radio or television renewal applicant seeking to continue its authority
to operate an FM Booster or TV booster station in conjunction with the primary station. The FM or TV booster station
should be described in terms of its call letters and the name of the specific community which it serves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Question 4. Aliens, foreign governments and corporations, and corporations of which less than 80% of the capital

licensee is directly or indirectly controlled by another corporation, of which any officer or more than 25% of the
directors are aliens or of which less than 75% of that corporation's stock is owned or voted by U.S. citizens, the Commission
must consider whether denial of renewal would serve the public interest. Licensees are expected to employ reasonable,
good faith methods to ensure the accuracy and completeness of their citizenship representations.

(d) A discussion of environmental and other considerations which led to the selection of the particular site and,
if relevant, the particular facility; the nature and extent of any unavoidable adverse environmental effects; and
any alternative sites of facilities which have been or might reasonably by considered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information submitted in the EA shall be factual (not argumentative or conclusory) and concise with sufficient
detail to explain the environmental consequences and to enable the Commission, after an independent review of the
EA, to reach a determination concerning the proposal's environmental impact, if any. The EA shall deal specifically
with any feature of the site which has special environmental significant (e.g., wilderness area, wildlife preserve,
natural migratory paths for birds and other wildlife, and sites of historic, architectural or archaeological value).
In the case of historically, significant sites, it shall specify the effect of the facilities on any district, site,
building, structure or object listed in the National Register of Historic Places, 39 Fed. Reg. 6402 (February 19,
1974). It shall also detail any substantial change in the character of the land utilized (e.g., deforestation, water
diversion, wetland fill, or other extensive change of surface features). In the case of wilderness areas, wildlife
preserves, or other like areas, the statement shall discuss the effect of any continuing pattern of human intrusion
into the area (e.g., necessitated by the operation and maintenance of the facilities).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EA shall also be accompanied with evidence of site approval which has been obtained from local or federal land use
authorities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To the extent that such information is submitted in another part of the application, it need not be duplicated in the
EA, but adequate cross-reference to such information shall be supplied.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An EA need not be submitted to the Commission if another agency of the Federal Government has assumed responsibility:
(a) for determining whether their facilities in question will have a significant effect on the quality of the human
environment and, (b) if it will affect the environment, for invoking the environmental impact statement process.

Section III_Question-By-Question Guidelines
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The section must be completed and submitted only by applicants for AM, FM, or TV broadcast stations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Question 1(a). Licensees of noncommercial educational and commercial radio and television broadcast stations
are required by Commission regulation (47 C.F.R. Section 73.2080) to afford equal employment opportunity to all
qualified persons and to refrain from discriminating in employment and related benefits on the basis of race, color,
religion, national origin or sex. In conjunction therewith, every station with five or more full-time employees
must file an employment report on or before May 31 of each year, identifying the station's staff by gender, race, or
color and/or national origin in each of nine major job categories. See 47 C.F.R. Section 73.3612.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, all AM, FM, and TV stations must file an original and one copy of an Equal Employment Opportunity Report
(FCC From 396) with their renewal application. The EEO form is required of all such licensees even where they do not
employ five or more full-time employees or where there are less than 5% minorities in the labor force (however, in such
cases you need only complete the first 2 pages of the EEO form).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Question 1(b). Each noncommercial educational broadcast station licensee is required to submit a current and complete
ownership report (FCC Form 323&hyph;E) with its station's renewal application. See 47 C.F.R. Section 73.361(d).
In such cases, the question should be answered affirmately. However, if the Form 323&hyph;E submitted with the station's
last renewal application is ``up-to-date'' and has been amended, a new ownership report need not be filed with the
current renewal application. The applicant should then answer the question negatively and supply the filing date
of that report and the call letters of the station for which it was submitted. An ``up-to-date'' Form 323-E ownership
report is one that is current for each question on that report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commercial broadcast station licensee is required to submit a current and complete ownership report (FCC Form 323)
once each year on the anniversary of the date that its license renewal application is required to be filed. See 47 C.F.R.
Section 73.3615(a). Licensees of multiple commercial broadcast stations with different renewal anniversary filing
dates may elect a single date to submit information, but the ownership reports may not be submitted more than one year
apart. If no charges have occurred, the licensee may submit a written certification to that fact, instead of filing
a new Form 323 each year. In addition, where the licensee is a partnership composed entirely of natural persons, the
annual reporting requirements does not apply. Similarly, sole proprietorships are exempt from the requirement
to file annually.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All commercial broadcast station licensee that are not exempt from the annual reporting program are required to file
Form 323 SEPARATELY from their renewal applications. The annual ownership report (Form 323 or written certification),
accompanied by its requisite fee payment for each station covered by that report, should be sent to the U.S. Treasury
lockbox bank at the appropriate address and in the manner specified in the ``Mass Media Services Fee Filing Guide.''
Additional information regarding the submission of this report us set fort in the Commission's Public Notice of June
6, 1990, entitled ``Broadcast Annual Ownership Report.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Question 2. A licensee must maintain certain documents pertaining to its station in a file which is usually kept at
the station's main studio or other accessible place in the community of licensee. The file must be available for inspection
by anyone during regular business hours. The documents to be maintained generally include applications for a construction
permit and for licensee renewal, assignment or transfer of control; ownership and employment reports; and quarterly
lists of the community issues most significantly addressed by the station's programming during the preceding three
months. In addition, commercial television licensees only are required to maintain a make available to the public
certain records regarding children's programming and the amount of commercial matter aired during the station's
broadcast of children's programming. A complete listing of the required documents and their mandatory retention
periods is set forth in 47 C.F.R. Section 734.3526 and 73.3527.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Question 3. This question should be completed only by a commercial radio or television renewal applicant. Licensees
for these stations should not that anytime it finds it necessary to cease broadcasting it must notify the Commission's
Washington, D.C. office, by letter, not later than the 120th day of discontinued operation. Further, if a licensee
finds it necessary to cease broadcasting in excess of 30 days, it must, no later than the 30th day of the station being
silent, submit a letter request (no filing fee is required) to the Commission's Washington, D.C. office for temporary
authority to remain silent. The request must include the date the station ceased broadcasting; a detailed explanation
of the reason why it was necessary to take the station off the air; efforts being made to restore service; and the date
by which resumption of operation is anticipated. The request must also include a certification relating to Section
5301 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (See, as an example, Section V, Certification (1), of the Form). Extensions
of temporary authority to remain silent and must be timely requested if station operations do not resume within the
time given. Licensees must notify the Commission's Washington, D.C. office, by letter, once operations have resumed,
giving the date that operations resumed. See 47 C.F.R. Sections 73.1740 and 73.1750.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Question 4. This question should be completed by commercial TV applicants only. Programming directed to the educational
and information needs of children is an identifiable unit of program material that is not a comical or promotional
announcement, that is originally produced and broadcast for an audience of children 16 years of age and under, and
that furthers, the positive development of the child in any respect, including, but not limited to, the child's cognitive/intellectual
or emotional/social needs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Questions 4(b) and (c). Commercial television licensees must limit the amount of commercial matter in ``children's
programming'', which is defined for this purpose as programming originally produced and broadcast primarily for
an audience of children 12 years of age and under. The children's programming commercial limitations are not more
than 12 minutes of commercial mater per hour on weekdays and no more than 10.5 minutes of commercials on weekends. The
commercial limits also apply 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
to children's programs which are 5 minutes or more and which are not part of a longer block of children's programming.
There are no restrictions on how commercial within the limits are configured within an hour's block of children's
programming. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
it is not necessary to prorate the commercial limits for separate children's programs within the hour.

This section must be completed and submitted only by applicants for FM or TV translator or LPTV broadcast station.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Question 1. An FM or TV translator or LPTV station is expected to provide continuous service except where cases beyond
its control warrant interruption. Where causes beyond the control of the licensee make it impossible to continue
operation, the station may discontinue operation for a period of 30 days without further authority from the FCC. However,
notification if the discontinuance must be sent to the FCC in Washington, D.C. no later than 10 days after the discontinued
operation. (See Section III, Question 3 of these Instructions for procedures for requesting temporary authority
to remain silent if the licensee finds it necessary to cease training for more than 30 days.) Failure to operate for
a period of 30 days of more, except for causes beyond the control of the licensee, shall be deemed evidence of discontinuation
of operation and the license of the translator or LPTV station may be canceled at the discretion of the FCC. See 47 C.F.R.
Sections 74.763 and 74.1263.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Questions 2 and 3. Section 325(a) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, prohibits the rebroadcast of the programs
of a broadcast station without the express authority of the originating station. Where the renewal applicant is not
the licensee of the originating station, written authority must be obtained prior to any rebroadcasting. Also, where
the licensee has changed the station being rebroadcast, written notification must be made to the Commission in accordance
with 47 C.F.R. Section 74.784 or 74.1251.

Question 4. This question should be answered by licensees of Low Power TV broadcast stations only. Licensees of Low
Power TV broadcast stations are required by 47 C.F.R. Section 73.2080 to afford equal employment opportunity to all
qualified persons and to refrain from discriminating in employment and related benefits on the basis of race, color,
religion, national origin or sex. In conjunction with these provisions, every station with five or or more full-time
employees must file an employment report on or before May 31 of each year, identifying the station's staff by gender,
race, color, and/or national origin in each of nine major job categories. See 47 C.F.R. Section 73.3612.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, LPTV stations must file an original and one copy of an Equal Employment Opportunity Report (FCC Form 396)
with their renewal application. This EEO form is required of all such licensees even where they do not employ five or
more full-time employees or where there are less than 5% minorities in the labor force (however, in such cases you need
only complete the first 2 pages of the EEO form).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Question 5(a). The provisions of 47 C.F.R. Section 74.1232(d) provide that an authorization for an FM translator
station whose coverage contour extends beyond the protected contour of the commercial primary station (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS is amending the regulations governing ``intermediary nation'' embargoes under the Marine Mammal Protection
Act (MMPA) by removing the regulatory definition of ``intermediary nation,'' which was inconsistent with a new statutory
definition and by incorporating the language of the statutory definition into the applicable regulatory text. This
amendment is necessary to bring the regulations into conformance with a recent amendment to the MMPA.

The MMPA requires the Secretary to prohibit the importation into the United States of any fish harvested with commercial
fishing technology that results in the incidental kill of ocean mammals in excess of U.S. standards. In the case of
yellowfin tuna harvested with purse seine nets in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, the MMPA prohibits the importation
directly from harvesting nations that do not have an affirmative finding from NMFS that they have a comparable marine
mammal protection program and mortality rate, as well as indirectly through intermediary nations. The MMPA defines
an ``intermediary nation'' as:

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

a nation that exports yellowfin tuna or yellowfin tuna products to the United States and that imports yellowfin tuna
or yellowfin tuna products that are subject to a direct ban on importation into the United States pursuant to section
101(a)(2)(B). (Pub. L. 102&hyph;582, section 401(a)).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to the enactment of Public Law 102&hyph;582, which added the definition of ``intermediary nation'' to the MMPA,
NMFS had promulgated a regulatory definition of the term in &sect;216.3. However, that regulatory definition does
not conform to the new statutory definition and, by this rule, is removed. The language of the statutory definition
is incorporated by this rule into the applicable regulatory text in &sect;216.24(e)(5)(xiv). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, this rule relocates to &sect;216.24(e)(5)(xiv) provisions pertaining to reasonable certification
and proof, transhipments, and revocation of intermediary nation findings, which were contained in the definition
removed from &sect;216.3, but which still remain applicable.

This rule amends an existing regulation, without prescribing law or policy, in order to conform the definition of
an ``intermediary nation'' to that contained in a statutory enactment. The Assistant Administrator finds under
section 553(b)(B) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) that good cause exists to waive prior notice and opportunity
for public comment on this rule in that they would serve no useful purpose. Further, in that this rule merely incorporates
a statutory definition already in effect, good cause exists under section 553(d)(3) of the APA to waive the 30-day
delay in effectiveness.

 Any yellowfin tuna or yellowfin tuna products in the classifications listed in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that the intermediary nation has provided reasonable proof and has certified to the United States that it has not imported,
in the preceding 6 months, yellowfin tuna or yellowfin tuna products that are subject to a ban on direct importation
into the United States under section 101(a)(2)(B) of the MMPA. A prohibition on imports under this paragraph may be
lifted by the Assistant Administrator upon a determination announced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, based upon new information supplied by the government of the intermediary nation, that the nation has not imported,
in the preceding 6 months, yellowfin tuna or yellowfin tuna products subject to a ban on direct imports under section
101(a)(2)(B) of the MMPA. Shipments of yellowfin tuna or yellowfin tuna products through a nation on a through bill
of lading or in another manner that does not enter the shipments into that nation as an importation do not make that nation
an intermediary nation. The Assistant Administrator shall act on any request to review decisions under this paragraph
(e)(5)(xiv) that are accompanied by specific and detailed supporting information or documentation, within 30 days
of receipt of such request. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(5)(xiv), certification and reasonable proof means
the submission by a responsible government official from the nation of a document reflecting the nation's customs
records for the preceding 6 months, together with a certificate attesting that the document is accurate.

 The groundfish fishery in the BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by NMFS according to the Fishery Management
Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery
Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels
is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The directed fishery for pollock in the BS by vessels catching pollock for processing by the offshore component was
closed on September 24, 1994, in order to reserve amounts anticipated to be needed for incidental catch in other fisheries
(59 FR 49032, September 26, 1994). NMFS has determined that as of November 12, 1994, 18,550 mt remain unharvested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined that the allowance of the TAC of pollock allocated to the offshore
component in the BS has not been reached. Therefore, NMFS is terminating the previous closure and is opening directed
fishing for pollock in the BS for vessels catching pollock for processing by the offshore component effective at 12
noon, A.l.t., December 5, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All other closures remain in full force and effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be found in the regulations at &sect;675.20(h).

Fifth Memorandum Opinion and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 the Commission resolves petitions for reconsideration or clarification of its competitive bidding rules for the
entrepreneurs' blocks, including provisions established to ensure that small businesses, rural telephone companies
and businesses owned by minorities and women (collectively termed ``designated entities'') have a meaningful opportunity
to participate in the provision of Personal Communications Services in the 2 GHz band (called ``broadband PCS'').
Among the issues the Commission re-examines in this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Memorandum Opinion and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
are matters concerning: the financial caps for entry into the entrepreneurs' block and qualification as a small business;
the equity requirements for the control group and other eligibility criteria; joint venture and consortia rules;
guidelines for defining

1. By this action, we resolve petitions for reconsideration or clarification of our rules governing competitive
bidding for ``entrepreneurs' block'' licenses in the 2 GHz band Personal Communications Service (``broadband PCS'').
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Twenty-six petitions were received, as well as 17 oppositions and 8 replies. Specifically, in this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Memorandum Opinion and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
we resolve issues associated with our entrepreneurs' block rules, as well as other provisions we established to ensure
that small businesses, rural telephone companies and businesses owned by minorities and women (collectively termed
``designated entities'') have meaningful opportunities to participate in the provision of broadband PCS. Our goal
in this proceeding is to ensure that designated entities have the opportunity to obtain licenses at auction as well
as the opportunity to have meaningful involvement in the management and building of our nation's broadband PCS infrastructure.
Thus, as we describe below, we make certain modifications to our rules so that they will better serve these goals.

2. When the new broadband PCS auction rules were adopted in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the Commission declared its intent to meet fully the statutory objective set forth by Congress in Section 309(j) of
the Communications Act. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 47 U.S.C. 309(j). In particular, we observed that it was the mandate of Congress that the Commission should ``ensure
that small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women are
given an opportunity to participate in the provision of spectrum-based services.'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 47 U.S.C. 309(j)(4)(D). We also noted that Congress has directed us to ``promote economic opportunity and competition
and ensure that new and innovative technologies are readily accessible to the American people by avoiding excessive
concentration of licenses and by disseminating licenses among a wide variety of applicants.'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 47 U.S.C. 309(j)(3)(B). With these congressional directives in mind, we established the entrepreneurs' blocks
and designated entity provisions contained in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, which are now under reconsideration.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Although we wish to ``fine-tune'' some aspects of our rules, we generally conclude that the ``entrepreneurs' block''
concept and the special provisions for designated entities adopted in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 are the most efficient and effective means to fulfill our statutory mandate to provide for a diverse and competitive
broadband PCS marketplace. In particular, we have adopted measures to ensure opportunities for meaningful participation
by minority and women-owned businesses in the emerging broadband PCS marketplace by providing that such entities
are eligible for bidding credits, installment payments, reduced up front payments and the benefits of tax certificates,
and by adopting eligibility rules that accommodate noncontrolling equity investment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. On reconsideration of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, we weigh the recommendations of those who have asked us to modify our rules. While we conclude that for the most part
our rules will remain unchanged, we find that some rule modifications are necessary to further empower businesses
owned by women and minorities and designated entities generally to participate in broadband PCS. Also, our rules
need to be clarified in some instances to provide entities wishing to participate in the entrepreneurs' blocks with
greater certainty and a better understanding of what is expected of them. Our rule changes will grant designated entities,
particularly minority and women-owned applicants, additional flexibility in how they raise capital and structure
their businesses. Minority-owned applicants, for example, should be able to draw more readily upon the financial
resources and expertise of other successful minority business enterprises. Our revised rules seek to accommodate
the many existing minority and women-owned firms that want to enter the PCS market, but whose existing corporate structures
do not meet the criteria for entry prescribed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Thus, experienced minority and women entrepreneurs, who are likely to succeed in the broadband PCS marketplace,
are not inadvertently barred from participating in the entrepreneurs' block under our new rules. In sum, our revised
rules permit entrepreneurs' block applicants to structure themselves in a way that better reflects the realities
of raising capital in today's markets, and to obtain the necessary management and technical expertise for their PCS
businesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. As we indicated above, a primary objective on reconsideration is to ensure that our rules promote diversity and
competition in the PCS marketplace of the future. In this regard, we believe a special effort must be made to enable
minority and women-owned enterprises to enter, compete and ultimately succeed in the broadband PCS market. These
designated entities face the most formidable barriers to entry, foremost of which is lack of access to capital. In
our effort to provide opportunities for minorities and women to participate in PCS via the auctions process, we strive
for a careful balance. On one hand, our rules must provide applicants with the flexibility they need to raise capital
and structure their businesses to compete once they win licenses. On the other hand, our rules must ensure that control
of the broadband PCS applicant, both as a practical and legal matter, as well as a meaningful measure of economic benefit,
remain with the designated entities our regulations are intended to benefit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. After reviewing the record, we amend or clarify our entrepreneurs' block rules in several respects.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 We emphasize that these changes constitute a refinement of our original entrepreneurs' block rules adopted in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that will further advance our objectives of promoting competition and diversity in the broadband PCS marketplace.

7. On August 10, 1993, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (the Budget Act) added Section 309(j) to the Communications
Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 309(j). This section gives the Commission express authority to employ competitive
bidding procedures to select among mutually exclusive applicants for certain initial licenses. In the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

awarded through competitive bidding and prescribed a broad menu of competitive bidding rules and procedures to be
used for all auctionable services.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to conduct three separate auctions for broadband PCS licenses: the first for the 99 available broadband PCS licenses
in MTA blocks A and B; the second for the 986 broadband PCS licenses in BTA blocks C and F (the ``entrepreneurs' blocks'');
and, the third for the remaining 986 broadband PCS licenses in BTA blocks D and E.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Fifth Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
address auction methodology, application and payment procedures, and other regulatory safeguards. In addition,
we established the entrepreneurs' block licenses to insulate smaller applicants from bidding against very large,
well-financed entities. We also supplemented our entrepreneurs' block regulations with other special provisions
designed to offer meaningful opportunities for designated entity participation in broadband PCS. In particular,
we made bidding credits and installment payment options available to those entrepreneurs and designated entities
that, according to the record of this proceeding, have demonstrated historic difficulties accessing capital. Additionally,
we extended the benefits of our tax certificate policies to broadband PCS minority and women applicants to promote
participation by these designated entities in the service. We also adopted attribution rules that accommodate passive
equity investment in designated entities, but ensure that control of the applicant resides in the intended beneficiaries
of the special provisions. Furthermore, we reduced the upfront payment required of bidders in the entrepreneurs'
block. Finally, we established partitioning rules to allow rural telephone companies to expedite the availability
of offerings in rural areas.

FCC 94&hyph;178 at &para;37. When we crafted our broadband PCS licensing rules in Gen. Docket 90&hyph;314, we divided
the licensed broadband PCS spectrum into three 30 MHz blocks (A, B, and C) and three 10 MHz blocks (D, E, and F). We also
designated two different service areas: 493 Basic Trading Areas (BTAs) and 51 Major Trading Areas (MTAs). The 493
BTAs and 51 MTAs used in our broadband PCS licensing rules have been adapted from the Rand McNally 1992 Commercial Atlas

11. The Association of Independent Designated Entities (AIDE) contends that the Commission exceeded its statutory
authority in establishing the entrepreneurs' block because they potentially benefit entities that fall outside
of the four designated entity groups enumerated by Congress. AIDE maintains that the entrepreneurs' blocks reduce
meaningful opportunities for smaller designated entities to participate in PCS by forcing them to bid against ``entrepreneurs''
that may not qualify as designated entities. AIDE further argues that the Commission impermissibly restricted the
availability of financial incentives to designated entities for use only in Blocks C and F. Instead, AIDE requests
that the Commission make its financial incentives for designated entities available for every auctionable broadband
PCS license. The United States Interactive &amp; Microwave Television Association and the United States Independent
Personal Communication Association (USIMTA/USIPCA) (filing jointly) support the entrepreneurs' block concept,
but encourage the Commission to provide additional broadband PCS spectrum exclusively for designated entities.
Citing Congress' concern about the historical impediments that small, minority and women-owned businesses have
encountered, USIMTA/USIPCA maintain that ``it would not be unreasonable'' to set aside up to one-half of the available
PCS spectrum. Finally, GTE Service Corporation (GTE) requests the Commission eliminate the entrepreneurs' blocks
and instead allow designated entities to ``partner'' with major investors and be eligible for more generous bidding
credits. Additionally, GTE contends that our entrepreneurs' block scheme unduly restricts the ability of cellular
carriers to participate in the provision of PCS. Specifically, GTE contends that this scheme, combined with the PCS-cellular
cross-ownership restrictions, will effectively limit eligibility for many cellular operators to 20 MHz of spectrum
on the D and E blocks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Contrary to AIDE's contention, it is within our statutory authority to establish the entrepreneurs' blocks,
for which parties other than designated entities are eligible to apply for or invest in, and we believe that this scheme
will provide meaningful opportunities for designated entities to participate in the provision of broadband PCS.
Accordingly, we will retain the entrepreneurs' block structure set forth in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In establishing a competitive bidding process for the provision of spectrum-based services, Congress gave the Commission
broad authority to adopt bidding procedures and policies, so long as certain objectives are fulfilled. Specifically,
Congress mandated that the Commission ``promot[e] economic opportunity and competition and ensur[e] that new and
innovative technologies are readily accessible to the American people by avoiding excessive concentration of licenses
and by disseminating licenses among a wide variety of applicants, including small businesses, rural telephone companies,
and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women.'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
47 U.S.C. 309(j)(3)(B). Thus, the language of the statute allows us to consider other entities in order to ensure that
licenses are widely dispersed among a variety of licensees,
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 so long as we also, among other statutory objectives, ensure that designated entities are given the opportunity to
participate in the provision of broadband PCS.

We believe the term ``including'' used in Section 309(j)(3)(B) of the Communications Act is a term of enlargement,
not limitation, intended to convey that other entities are includable together with, rather than excluded from the
categories of designated entities so long as legislative intent is satisfied.

13. The entrepreneurs' blocks approach adopted in our 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
achieves the statute's objectives by creating significant opportunities for designated entities and other entrepreneurs
to ensure that licenses are widely disbursed to entities that can rapidly deploy broadband PCS services. We are making
additional changes to our rules (including eliminating the personal net worth cap and liberalizing our affiliation
rules for individual minority investors) to help designated entities overcome particularly intractable historic
difficulties in accessing capital. To satisfy Congress' directive, we established the entrepreneurs' blocks in
conjunction with a package of benefits that are narrowly tailored to provide significant opportunities to designated
entities and those entrepreneurs that lack access to capital.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. We disagree with USIMTA/USIPCA who requests that the Commission provide additional spectrum for entrepreneurs'
blocks. Our existing allotment, which comprises one-third of the total amount of licensed broadband PCS spectrum,
is sufficient to ensure that designated entities and other entrepreneurs have significant opportunities to participate
in the PCS marketplace. We therefore deny petitioners' various requests for modification to our entrepreneurs'
block provisions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
15. We also reject AIDE's proposal to make bidding credits and other special provisions available to all designated
entities bidding on all of the broadband PCS frequency blocks (not just the C and F blocks). Our existing approach of
limiting these special provisions to the entrepreneurs' blocks, coupled with changes we are making today are narrowly
tailored to meet Congress' objective of ensuring that designated entities have the opportunity to participate in
broadband PCS. The record does not support broadening this relief to include additional frequency blocks, nor is
there substantial support for broadening the availability of special provisions generally.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. Similarly, we do not accept GTE's argument that we should do away with the entrepreneurs' blocks and instead offer
bidding credits as well as other special provisions across all broadband PCS frequency blocks. As we already explained
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, in our judgment we do not anticipate designated entities to realize meaningful opportunities for participation
in broadband PCS unless we supplement bidding credits and other special provisions with a limitation on the size of
the entities designated entities will bid against. Without the insulation of the entrepreneurs' block, the record
strongly supports the conclusion that measures such as bidding credits will prove ineffective for broadband PCS.
We also disagree with GTE's contention that our entrepreneurs' block plan unduly restricts the ability of cellular
carriers to provide PCS. We believe that the public interest benefits of establishing an entrepreneurs' block outweigh
the need to provide additional opportunities for cellular operators as GTE describes. Moreover, our rules do allow
cellular operators such as GTE to take noncontrolling interests in designated entities and gain opportunities in
the entrepreneurs' block. We have recently revised the cellular-PCS crossownership rules to facilitate such opportunities.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the Commission established eligibility rules for the entrepreneurs' blocks based, in part, on an applicant's gross
revenues. To bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks, the applicant, its attributable investors (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, members of its control group and investors holding 25 percent or more of the applicant's total equity), and their
respective affiliates must cumulatively have gross revenues of less than $125 million in each of the last two years
and total assets of less than $500 million at the time the applicant files its Form 175 (``short form'' application).
We pointed out in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that the $125 million gross revenues limit corresponds roughly to the Commission's definition of a ``Tier 2,'' or
medium-sized local exchange carrier (LEC) and would include virtually all of the independently-owned rural telephone
companies. Additionally, to qualify for the special provisions accorded small businesses, the applicant (including
attributable investors and affiliates), must cumulatively have less than $40 million in gross revenues averaged
over the last three years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18. MasTec, Inc. (MasTec) argues that the Commission's gross revenues test is misleading when applied across the
board to all applicants because the gross revenues of investors operating in different industries will not convey
the same information about size or the ability to attract capital. The Telephone Electronics Corporation (TEC) notes
that the discontinuity between gross revenues and the ability to attract capital is particularly acute where the
entity in question is involved in a volume-intensive business with high operating costs and small profit margins
(such as TEC's interexchange resale carriers). Accordingly, TEC argues that the Commission's gross revenue criteria
are not rationally related to their stated purpose and should be eliminated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
19. Several petitioners request that the Commission modify its gross revenues test, but disagree whether the limits
should be liberalized or made more restrictive. For example, MasTec encourages the Commission to modify its designated
entity criteria to include those minority businesses which are too small to compete outside of the entrepreneur blocks,
but too large to qualify for the entrepreneurs' blocks. The National Paging and Personal Communications Association
(NPPCA) and USIMTA/USIPCA urge the Commission to reduce the gross revenues cap. Specifically, NPPCA requests that
the Commission reduce the gross revenues limit to $75 million and the total assets limit to $250 million. NPPCA maintains
that these modifications are needed because the present size standards encourage mid-sized companies to refrain
from bidding in competitively unrestricted auctions and to compete, instead, against designated entities in the
entrepreneurs' block auctions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20. As an alternative to increasing the revenues cap, Omnipoint Communications, Inc. (Omnipoint) and the National
Association of Black Owned Broadcasters, Inc. (NABOB) argue that the ``aggregation rule,'' under which the Commission
will aggregate the gross revenues and total assets of the applicant, attributable investors and all affiliates in
order to determine whether the applicant complies with the financial caps, should be eliminated. Omnipoint contends
that a ``multiplier approach,'' employed in other areas of Commission practice, should be used to determine compliance
with the financial caps. Under this approach, the revenues and assets attributed to an applicant would be based on
the revenues and assets of each attributable investor, multiplied by the percentage ownership interest in the applicant
held by that investor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
21. Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA) requests that the Commission prescribe specific
dates for measuring the financial thresholds to determine entrepreneurs' block eligibility. Specifically, CTIA
requests clarification that gross revenues will be measured from the two years preceding September 23, 1993.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 CTIA maintains that our current rules, referring only to the ``last two calendar years,'' are ambiguous.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, states that ``[a]ny licensee *&blank;*&blank;* shall maintain its eligibility [for the entrepreneurs' blocks]
until at least five years from the date of initial license grant, except that increased gross revenues, increased
total assets or personal net worth due to non-attributable equity investments *&blank;*&blank;*, debt financing,
revenue from operations, business development or expanded service shall not be considered.'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 47 CFR 24.709(a)(3). Petitioners ask us to clarify whether the following types of growth in assets, revenues, or personal
net worth would result in a licensee's forfeiture of eligibility: (1) Growth of applicant beyond the size limits by
means of mergers or takeovers; (2) any control group member's growth beyond the size limits by means of appreciation
of attributable investments or growth of attributable businesses; and (3) affiliates' or attributable investors'
growth beyond the size limits, by means of mergers or takeovers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

23. We will retain a single gross revenues size standard, which is an established method for determining size eligibility
for various kinds of federal programs that aid smaller businesses.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 We anticipate that applicants will, in many instances, have several investors and that these investors will be drawn
from various segments of the economy rather than from a single industry group such as telecommunications. The financial
characteristics of these industry groups will vary widely,
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 and keying the size standard to each investor entity in question is thus administratively unworkable. A gross revenues
test is a clear measure for determining the size of a business, and will produce the most equitable result for entrepreneurs'
block applicants as a whole.

24. We will also retain the existing gross revenues and total assets limits for the entrepreneurs' blocks and for small
business size status. We find the arguments of those who oppose any reduction in the gross revenues limit most persuasive.
BET, for example, supports the balance it perceives the Commission has struck between small and mid-sized firms by
adopting a $125 million gross revenues test. We agree with BET that a decrease in the gross revenue limit would eliminate
many mid-sized firms from entrepreneurs' block participation while not substantially raising the level of competition
in the blocks. Conversely, an increase in the gross revenue limit would not necessarily provide for greater capital
access for applicants. We believe our $125 million gross revenues test represents an appropriate benchmark for entry
into the entrepreneurs' block, given our interest in including firms that, while not large in comparison to other
telecommunications companies, are likely to have the financial resources to compete against larger competitors
on the MTA blocks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
25. In addition, we will retain the aggregation methodology to assess the size of an applicant, with certain exceptions.
We reject NABOB's proposal to eliminate our aggregation rule and we cannot adopt Omnipoint's proposal to determine
entrepreneurs' block eligibility and small business size status by separately evaluating the assets and revenues
of each attributable investor. Aggregating the gross revenues and total assets of all attributable investors in
and affiliates of the applicant is central to an accurate size determination, and consistent with the Small Business
Administration's (SBA's) approach to similar determinations. Viewing gross revenues and assets of each investor
in isolation could result in very large entities bidding for these licenses. We reject Omnipoint's suggestion that
a multiplier approach be used to make these size determinations. A multiplier is appropriate to arrive at an accurate
determination of ownership interest in an applicant or licensee. In this context, however, we are not concerned with
ownership, but instead seek to make a financially-based size determination in order to assess whether an applicant
is eligible for significant governmental benefits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
26. We agree with CTIA that clarification is required concerning the two-year period in order to provide applicants
with a uniform way to measure gross revenues for purposes of qualifying for the entrepreneurs' blocks. For the initial
entrepreneurs' block auctions involving broadband PCS, companies should use audited financial statements for
each of the two calendar years ending December 31, 1993 or, if audited financial statements are not prepared on a calendar-year
basis, data from audited financial statements for their two most recently completed fiscal years. Therefore, if
applicants and their investors do not have audited statements ending on December 31, 1993, they will have to use one
annual statement ending at a later date (sometime in 1994). This approach will enable the Commission to obtain timely
financial data while providing applicants with some degree of flexibility in their financial reporting practices.
For subsequent entrepreneurs' block auctions (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 license reauctioning), we will require applicants to use their last two annual audited financial statements to determine
compliance with the financial caps. Newly-formed companies should use the audited financial statements of their
predecessors in interests, or financial statements current as of the time their Form 175 (short-form) application
is filed that are certified by the applicant as accurate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
27. Clarification is also needed with respect to the issue of growth and takeovers of an entrepreneurs' block licensee
or its investors. We clarify our rules to the extent necessary to indicate what types of growth will jeopardize an applicant's
continued eligibility as an entrepreneurs' block licensee during the holding period. A licensee could not maintain
its eligibility if a member of its control group were itself taken over, effecting a transfer of control of the licensee
during the license holding period. However, an attributable investor would not affect the licensee's continuing
eligibility for the entrepreneurs' block if another of the investor's affiliates grew or its investments appreciated
during the holding period. Our rules consider such growth either to be revenue from the investor's operations or to
be normal business development and, in either case, fully permissible. If an attributable investor is taken over
or purchased by another entity, the other entity steps into the shoes of the original investor and its assets and revenues
will be considered under the continued eligibility rule. However, if an affiliate of the applicant is taken over by
(or sold to) another entity, the other entity's assets and revenues would not be considered, so long as no new affiliation
arrangement between the applicant and the other entity is created by the takeover or sale. That is, in most cases, the
affiliation with the applicant would be severed by such a takeover and the gain from the sale of the affiliates' assets
would have already been taken into account by the initial consideration of such assets at the time of application.
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 We emphasize that we have a strong interest in seeing entrepreneurs grow and succeed in the PCS marketplace. Thus,
normal projected growth of gross revenues and assets, or growth such as would occur as a result of a control group member's
attributable investments appreciating, or as a result of a licensee acquiring additional licenses would not generally
jeopardize continued eligibility as an entrepreneurs' block licensee.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Thus, for example, if Applicant A is affiliated with Corporation B and that corporation sells its business to Corporation
C, the income derived from the sale would not affect Applicant A's continued eligibility, unless a new affiliation
arrangement arises between Applicant A and Corporation C.

28. In addition to the gross revenues and assets caps, the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 also established a personal net worth limit to determine eligibility for bidding in the entrepreneurs' blocks. The
current rules require that persons that are applicants, attributable investors in the applicant and all of their
respective affiliates who are themselves individuals each have less than $100 million in personal net worth. Additionally,
the rules require that if the applicant seeks to qualify as a small business each individual in the control group, attributable
investors and all affiliates who are individuals, must have less than $40 million in personnel net worth. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 47 CFR 24.720.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
29. BET requests the Commission relax the personal net worth limits applicable to attributable investors in minority-owned
firms. BET argues that eliminating the personal net worth standard would help ensure participation by minority and
women-owned businesses by allowing successful individuals to bring their experience to bear in the PCS marketplace.
At the same time, BET argues that this measure would ensure that relatively small, minority and women-owned enterprises
have a meaningful opportunity to participate in the provision of PCS. TEC also requests the Commission liberalize
its personal net worth standard to permit an attributable individual investor to hold up to $125 million in personal
net worth. MasTec claims that net worth/net revenue definitions are overly restrictive and will exclude those minority
businesses that can best survive and succeed in the competitive PCS market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30. We will eliminate the personal net worth limits (both for the entrepreneurs' blocks and for small business size
status) for all applicants, attributable investors, and affiliates. The obstacles faced by minorities and minority-controlled
businesses in raising capital are well-documented in this proceeding and are not necessarily confined to minorities
with limited personal net worth. Therefore, we agree with the view that the personal net worth requirements should
be eliminated in the case of minority-controlled applicants seeking to qualify for entrepreneurs' block licenses.
However, rather than eliminate the personal net worth limits for minorities only, we will eliminate the requirement
for all applicants because personal net worth limits are difficult to apply and enforce and may be easily manipulated.
We do not believe that eliminating the personal net worth limits will facilitate significant encroachment by ``deep
pockets'' that can be accessed by wealthy individuals through affiliated entities because, in those instances where
access to such resources would create an unfair advantage, the affiliation rules will continue to apply and require
that such an entity's assets and revenues be included in determining an applicant's size. Thus, we emphasize that
we believe the affiliation rules make the personal net worth rules largely unnecessary since most wealthy individuals
are likely to have their wealth closely tied to ownership of another business.

31. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 sets forth specific affiliation rules for identifying all individuals and entities whose gross revenues and assets
must be aggregated with those of the applicant in determining whether the applicant exceeds the financial caps for
the entrepreneurs' blocks (or for small business size status). The affiliation rules were adapted from those used
by the SBA for purposes of assessing size status and consequent eligibility to participate in SBA's loan, procurement
and minority enterprise programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
32. Specifically, our rules identify which individuals or entities will be found to control or be controlled by the
applicant or an attributable investor by specifying which ownership interests or other criteria will give rise to
a finding of control and consequent affiliation. In the August 15, 1994

33. BET and others argue that we did not provide adequate notice or opportunity to comment on the possibility of the
Commission adopting affiliation rules for all entrepreneurs' block participants (specifically, minorities and
women). BET argues that we have thus violated the notice and comment requirements of the Administrative Procedure
Act (APA), and that the Commission is required to issue a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Further Notice
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 prior to adopting the affiliation rules. BET also contends that the affiliation rules add unnecessary complexity
to the broadband auction rules and that they make it very difficult, if not impossible, for potential bidders to tailor
their pre-existing business relationships and ownership structures to our eligibility requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
34. Several parties have filed petitions for reconsideration of our Order on Reconsideration. On reconsideration
of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 several petitioners also challenge the limited exemption granted to Indian tribes or request that generic exemptions
be granted for other applicants. BET and MasTec oppose any special treatment for a particular minority group, arguing
that the exemption accorded Indian tribes creates an imbalance of bidding power in favor of tribally-owned entities
and will skew the broadband PCS auction results. Cook Inlet Region, Inc. (Cook Inlet) argues that the exemption for
Indian tribes should be expanded to encompass eligibility for treatment as a small business for purposes of bidding
credits and installment payments because: (1) Indian tribes are congressionally recognized as particularly disadvantaged;
(2) such an exemption applies when determining size status for SBA's programs; and, (3) substantial legal constraints
with respect to tribal property and businesses preclude their use to raise capital or to cross-subsidize other tribally-owned
entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
35. More specifically, Cook Inlet assets that Indian tribes and Native corporations deserve special treatment because
they face legal constraints that differ from other minority-owned businesses. According to Cook Inlet, Federal
law prohibits Native corporations from pledging their stock as collateral for loans, issuing new stock to raise funds
in traditional capital markets, or utilizing the majority of the revenues from their land holdings to invest in new
enterprises. Thus, Cook Inlet contends that Indian tribes and Native corporations should be exempt from both the
affiliation rules and the small business test because Native corporations cannot utilize their assets or revenues
to fund new business ventures in the same way other corporations can. In reply, BET asserts that Alaska Regional Corporations
still enjoy significantly greater access to capital than other minority-owned entities participating in the bidding
for the entrepreneurs' block licenses despite any restrictions they might have on their assets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
36. TEC seeks an exemption from the affiliation rules for rural telephone companies, arguing that regulatory and
corporate barriers prohibit small telephone companies like TEC from shifting broadband PCS costs to their affiliated
resellers and that courts have found questions of affiliation to be irrelevant where such barriers to cross-subsidization
exist. MEANS/SDN suggests a more narrowly tailored exception that would exempt centralized equal access providers
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a consortia of rural telephone companies that provide centralized equal access and other sophisticated information
services) from the Commission's affiliation rules. MEANS/SDN argues that this modification would allow the consortia
to bring their considerable expertise and efficiencies to bear in the deployment of broadband PCS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
37. After considering petitioners' various concerns, we will not eliminate the affiliation rules. As explained
fully below, however, we create a limited exception to our affiliation rules that will apply when an attributable
minority investor or enterprise in an applicant or an applicant's control group has controlling interests in other
concerns. We also revise our treatment of Indian tribes under our affiliation rules to more narrowly tailor our application
of these rules to the unique status of these minority groups.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
38. As an initial matter we do not believe the promulgation of the affiliation rules violated the notice and comment
requirements of the Administrative Procedures Act. Our 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Notice of Proposed Rule Making
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in this docket
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
 alerted petitioners to the fact that the Commission was considering SBA's size standards which, by their terms (as
set forth in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), incorporate the concept of affiliation in determining a firm's small business size status.
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 The question of affiliation is integral to the concept of size status, by whatever means size status is assessed. Without
affiliation rules, large firms may unfairly avail themselves of the preferences intended for small businesses and
other designated entities since they have an incentive to create subsidiaries (that would have access to the parent's
substantial resources) to compete against 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 applicants in the entrepreneurs' blocks. Adoption of affiliation rules similar to those used by the SBA is a logical
outgrowth of the Commission's decision to impose a gross revenues test for small businesses and to consider SBA's
size standards in establishing that test.
<FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>
 It was reasonable for petitioners to conclude that such rules would be applied in assessing eligibility for the entrepreneurs'
blocks and for small business size status. Thus, sufficient opportunity to comment was provided on the affiliation
rules since they play an integral role in any determination of size status. Moreover, we see no advantage in seeking
additional comment on the affiliation rules since petitioners, such as BET, had a full and fair opportunity to suggest
modifications to our affiliation rules, some of which we adopt on reconsideration. A

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
39. Furthermore, we decline to adopt the suggestion that we eliminate the affiliation rules on the grounds that these
rules are unduly complex or overburdensome. Affiliation rules are an established and essential element in determining
an applicant's compliance with a gross revenues (or other) size standard. Their use ensures that all financial and
other resources available to a company will be considered in assessing its size status. The Commission's affiliation
rules, in conjunction with its attribution rules, are intended to include in this calculation: (1) All individuals
and entities that directly or indirectly control the applicant, any member of its control group, or any other investor
having an attributable interest in the applicant; (2) any other entities also controlled by such individual or entity;
(3) all entities over which the applicant has direct control or indirect control through an intermediary; and (4)
all other entities over which a member of its control group or any other attributable investor has direct or indirect
control. Elimination of the affiliation rules would result in an underassessment of an applicant's size and would
present an unrealistic picture of the applicant's need for bidding credits, installment payments and reduced up
front payments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40. We are persuaded, however, that a limited exception to our affiliation rules is appropriate for minority-owned
applicants and applicants owned by a combination of minorities and women. The exception will apply to affiliates
controlled by investors who are members of minority groups who are attributable members of an applicant's control
group. Under the exception, the gross revenues and assets of affiliates that the minority investor controls will
not be counted in determining the applicant's compliance with the financial caps, both for purposes of the entry into
the entrepreneurs' block and for purposes of the applicant qualifying as a small business.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
41. This exception will permit minority investors that control other concerns to be members of an applicant's control
group and to bring their management skills and financial resources to bear in its operation without the assets and
revenues of those other concerns being counted as part of the applicant's total assets and revenues. By making such
an exception, we further our goal of addressing traditional problems minorities have of accessing capital. As we
documented in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report &amp; Order,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 minorities have faced and continue to face unique barriers to capital from traditional, non-minority sources. To
raise capital for a new business venture, therefore, minorities need the ability to draw upon the financial strength
and business experience of successful minorities and minority-owned businesses within their own communities;
they may not have access to any other source of funds on which to draw. Moreover, this exception permits minority applicants
to pool their resources with other minority-owned businesses and draw on the expertise of those who have faced similar
barriers to raising capital in the past.
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 We therefore conclude that further tailoring of our affiliation rules to the specific capital formation problems
of minorities is necessary to avoid eliminating a traditional source of capital for minority businesses_the minority
community itself. We note that this exception applies only to affiliates controlled by minority investors in the
applicant or members of the applicant's control group. The exception does not apply to affiliates of such investors
or businesses that control the applicant or that have an attributable interest in the applicant. Thus, a minority-owned
firm that exceeds the financial caps would not be able to create a subsidiary to participate in a PCS applicant's control
group.

For example, if M, an attributable minority investor in the applicant, controls Corporation C with assets of $500
million, but Corporation C does not control applicant A and is not an attributable investor in Applicant A, the assets
and revenues of Corporation C will not be counted in assessing A's compliance with the financial caps for either the
entrepreneurs' blocks or small business size status. On the other hand, if M Corporation, a minority-owned company
with an attributable interest in Applicant A, is controlled by Corporation C in the above example, or is under common
control with Corporation C, the assets and revenues of M Corporation's affiliates are attributable.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Order on Reconsideration,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we treat Indian tribes differently under our affiliation rules for purposes of our entrepreneurs' block financial
caps because of their unique legal status. Specifically, we exclude the gross revenues and total assets of Indian
tribes in our calculations for purposes of determining whether an affiliated applicant satisfies our entrepreneurs'
block financial caps. After considering the arguments of petitioners, we also will exclude generally the revenues
of Indian tribes in our calculations for purposes of determining small business eligibility.

43. In response to MasTec's and BET's concerns about special treatment for a particular minority group, we clarify
that we exempt Indian tribes generally from our affiliation rules because Congress has imposed unique legal constraints
on the way they can utilize their revenues and assets. Cook Inlet contends that, while other minority-owned businesses
can issue debt and equity securities and pledge their assets and securities to raise capital, the real and personal
property interests held by Alaska Native Corporations are subject to a number of constraints_both legal and cultural_that
affect their ability to manage and dispose of property. For example, under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act,
43 U.S.C. 1601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the stock held by Native corporations is subject to strict alienability restrictions_it cannot be sold, pledged,
mortgaged, or otherwise encumbered. Thus, Native corporations are precluded from two of the most important means
of raising capital enjoyed by virtually every other corporation: (1) The ability to pledge stock of the company against
ordinary borrowings, and (2) the ability to issue new stock or debt securities. In addition, assets held by Indian
tribes include land holdings that cannot be used as collateral for purposes of raising capital, because the land holdings
are owned in trust by the federal government or are subject to a restraint on alienation in the government's favor.
Congress has not placed similar legal constraints on the assets and revenues of enterprises owned by any other minority
group. We agree with Cook Inlet that such legal restraints on assets and revenues place Indian tribes at a disadvantage
vis-a-vis other minority groups with similar revenues and assets. Finally, as we noted in our 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Order on Reconsideration,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Congress has mandated that the SBA determine the size of a business concern owned by a Tribe without regard to the concern's
affiliation with the Indian tribe. Our policy mirrors this congressional mandate.

44. After considering the record, however, we have determined that gaming revenues generally are not subject to the
same types of legal restrictions as other revenues received by Indian tribes. Therefore, we establish a rebuttable
presumption that revenues derived from gaming pursuant to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 25 U.S.C. 2701 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
will be included in our calculations when determining whether an applicant that is affiliated with an Indian tribe
qualifies for the entrepreneurs' block or as a small business. Cook Inlet has set forth several reasons why we should
treat gaming revenues differently from other types of Indian tribe revenues. First, Cook Inlet argues that these
revenues were not part of the tribal economic picture when Congress enacted the SBA tribal exception to the affiliation
rule in 1970. Second, Cook Inlet contends that the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act provides certain Indian tribes with
a non-traditional source of revenue that could be very substantial. Cook Inlet also asserts that gaming revenues
are not subject to the same types of legal and governmental controls as other revenues received by Indian tribes, and
therefore are more analogous to the revenues of non-Indian entities. Furthermore, Congress granted the SBA (whose
rules inspired our affiliation rules) flexibility to treat tribal and other affiliations with exceptional revenues
differently if such revenues would create an ``unfair competitive advantage.''
<FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>
 Gaming revenues generated by tribal organizations, appear to be exceptional revenues that if not included, create
an unfair competitive advantage in the auctioning of broadband PCS entrepreneurs' block licenses. Thus, we will
include such gaming revenues in our calculations when determining eligibility for the entrepreneurs' block and
for small business status, unless the entrepreneurs' block applicant establishes that it will not receive an unfair
competitive advantage, because significant legal constraints restrict its ability (or an affiliate's ability)
to access and utilize revenues from gaming.

45. Finally, we decline to create an exception to our affiliation rules for rural telephone companies. We are concerned
that relaxing our rules would unfairly match large rural telephone companies, with greater access to capital, against
entrepreneurs and designated entities (including small and medium-sized rural telephone companies). We note in
this regard, that rural telephone companies already enjoy substantial regulatory benefits (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
access to Rural Electrification Administration loans) affecting available capital in comparison to other designated
entities. Moreover, we observe that rural telephone companies will be permitted to acquire partitioned licenses
at any time after the close of auctions. We believe that existing measures will thereby achieve our goal of facilitating
the rapid deployment of PCS to rural areas. At MEANS/SDN's request, however, we clarify that a centralized equal access
provider (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a group of rural telephone companies that provide centralized equal access and other sophisticated information
services)
<FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>
 will not be deemed an affiliate of each of its constituent members. Based on the record, it does not appear that such
entities control their constituent members or that each of the members control the centralized equal access providers.
Thus, for example, if two or more of MEANS' members form a consortium of small businesses that apply for the entrepreneurs'
blocks, MEANS itself would not be attributed to each one of the small businesses. We agree with MEANS that this clarification
will contribute to the efficient deployment of broadband PCS in rural areas.

47. Karl Brothers requests that the Commission amend its definition of ``members of minority groups'' to include
businesses owned by individuals with disabilities. Specifically, Karl Brothers suggest the Commission adopt the
standard established in the SBA Section 8(a) program to determine who should qualify for designated entity status.
According to Karl Brothers, this SBA program includes businesses owned by disabled individuals under a ``means''
and ``socially disadvantaged'' test. Karl Brothers maintains that the congressional mandate to give special preference
to minority groups is not limited to just ethnic minorities, but should include other historically disadvantaged
minorities. Karl Brothers maintains that Congress was merely giving examples of groups to be included in the definition
of minorities, not limiting the definition to ethnic groups only. Karl Brothers contends that there is no statutory
language excluding other disadvantaged groups.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
48. After considering Karl Brothers' request, we will not include persons with disabilities in the definition of
minorities for purposes of bidding on the entrepreneurs' blocks and obtaining the special provisions available
to minority applicants. The record in this proceeding does not contain any evidence that demonstrates that firms
owned by persons with disabilities have more difficulty accessing capital than any other small business. In this
respect, the record of this proceeding on the difficulties that minorities, women and small businesses, in general,
have experienced accessing capital strongly supports the special provisions we adopted for these groups. Moreover,
individuals with disabilities are not expressly named as a designated entity in Section 309(j)(4)(D) of the Communications
Act, and there is no indication in the legislative record of the statute that Congress intended to expand this group
of beneficiaries to include any group or individual that can demonstrate that it is ``socially disadvantaged'' similar
to the SBA Section 8(a) approach described by the Karl Brothers. Unlike the Small Business Act, Section 309(j)(4)(D)
of the Communications Act does not contain the term ``socially disadvantaged.''

8(a) status for minority groups (which are defined in racial and ethnic terms), but firms owned by persons with disabilities
must demonstrate that they are ``socially disadvantaged'' in order to gain entry into the program. Also, the SBA's
denial of Section 8(a) status for firms owned by persons with disabilities where such ``social disadvantage'' has
not been established, has been upheld in court.

49. Additionally, there is no indication that in enacting Section 309(j)(4)(D) Congress intended to expand the definition
of ``members of minority groups'' to include classes of persons other than racial or ethnic groups, such as those listed
in the preceding subsection, Section 309(i).
<FOOTCITE>26</FOOTCITE>
 We further observe that in no other Commission context, have we included disabled persons in the categories of groups
that comprise our definition of minorities. Making such a change here, without clear statutory and legislative support
to do so, would therefore be inconsistent with our traditional application of the definition, which we believe should
be uniform in all licensing contexts.

50. We wish to emphasized also, that it is highly likely that most firms owned by individuals with disabilities will
be eligible to bid in the entrepreneurs' block and for an installment payment option if they meet the required gross
revenues and total assets test. Such firms may also be eligible for ``enhanced'' installment payments and bidding
credits if they qualify as small businesses under our rules. Indeed, absent a substantial record that demonstrates
firms owned by persons with disabilities have any more difficulty accessing capital then any other small business,
we find that we cannot accommodate the Karl Brothers request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
51. We also note that we have before us a Petition for Rulemaking filed by David J. Lieto (Lieto Petition), which requests
that the Commission amend Section 1.2110 of the Commission's rules to provide that disabled individuals are within
the minority group categories and are thus entitled to the benefits associated with being a designated entity under
the Commission's auction rules.

David J. Lieto Petition for Rulemaking, filed September 21, 1994, at 2&hyph;3. As stated above, we believe that our
existing rules provide opportunities for individuals with disabilities to participate in the entrepreneurs' block,
and that there is no direct statutory or record support for Lieto's request. Furthermore, Lieto has failed to provide
a record comparable to that for women and minorities demonstrating that disabled individuals experience difficulties
accessing capital that are unique to their status. Accordingly, we decline to initiate a rulemaking at this time,

Small Business Consortia

53. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the Commission allowed a consortium of small businesses to qualify collectively for the preferences available to
a small business if each business within the consortium individually satisfies the definition of a small business
designated entity. The Commission defined a small business designated entity as any company that, together with
attributable investors and affiliates, has average gross revenues for the three preceding years of not in excess
of $40 million. We defined ``consortium of small businesses'' as a conglomerate organization formed as a joint venture
among mutually-independent business firms, each of which individually satisfies the definition of a small business.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, we concluded that consortia should not always be entitled to qualify for measures designed specifically for designated
entities. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, however, we stated that for the auctioning of broadband PCS, it is especially necessary to allow small businesses
to pool their resources in this manner to help them overcome capital formation problems. Thus, our rules provide that
if a consortium's members are all small businesses (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, defined as companies that do not have average yearly gross revenues for the preceding three years in excess of $40
million), the consortium as a whole will qualify for designated entity provisions for small businesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
54. Omnipoint requests that the Commission allow small businesses to form a single corporate applicant (rather than
a joint venture) and get the same treatment as consortia. BET requests that the Commission eliminate the preference
available to small business consortia.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
55. We believe the current preferences for small business consortia are adequate and necessary to ensure that small
businesses have sufficient opportunities to participate in the broadband PCS auctions. Accordingly, we deny BET's
request to eliminate the small business consortia preferences. As we observed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, allowing small businesses to pool their resources in this manner is necessary to help them overcome capital formation
problems and ensure their participation in the provision of broadband PCS. We believe that small, rural telephone
companies, in particular, are expected to use this mechanism to compete in some of the smaller markets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
56. We also deny Omnipoint's request that small businesses be allowed to form a single corporate applicant that would
be afforded the same treatment as consortia. The concept of a consortium is that each small business participant remains
a distinct corporate entity independent of other consortium members and that each member has rights and obligations
similar, or equal to, those held by participants in other types of joint ventures. Allowing a group of small businesses
to apply as one corporate applicant and receive the benefits or our consortia rule would disadvantage small, independent
businesses wishing to bid as a group under our rule, but who cannot restructure as a corporate applicant and could tend
to dilute each member's influence and insulate their responsibilities in the venture. We believe that such a change
would also eviscerate our small business eligibility size requirement. We wish to clarify, however, that we intent
to examine the qualifications of each consortium member to ensure that each is a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
bona fide
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 small business. In this regard, it is assumed that each concern should be an entity ``organized for profit'' and not
for the sole purpose of qualifying as part of a small business consortia. This is consistent with SBA's long-standing
definition of ``business concern.''

57. On another issue, BET contends that the $40 million gross revenues standard fails to comply with an SBA requirement
that any size standard proposed by a federal agency that varies from SBA's standard be ``proposed after an opportunity
for public notice and comment'' and be ``approved by the Administrator [of the SBA].''
<FOOTCITE>33</FOOTCITE>
 We believe we have fully met our notice and comment obligations, both under the Administrative Procedures Act and
the Small Business Act, in this proceeding. We solicited comment on a range of size options, and received comment that
included SBA's recommendation for a $40 million gross revenues cap (which we ultimately adopted). Indeed, we recently
obtained SBA's approval of the $40 million size standard.

Minimum Equity Limit for the Control Group
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
58. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the Commission adopted a methodology for assessing an applicant's compliance with the financial caps for the entrepreneurs'
blocks and for small business size status based on the distinction between: (a) Noncontrolling investors (whose
financial status would not be attributed to the applicant); and (b) investors holding interests in the control group
of the applicant. The gross revenues, assets and personal net worth limits of attributable investors (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
those with more than 25 percent equity) and all control group members, regardless of the size of their individual interests,
are included in assessing an applicant's compliance with the financial caps. To qualify as a women or minority-owned
business, the Commission further required that the control group be composed entirely of women and minorities. The
control group requirement ensures that designated entity and entrepreneur principals retain control of the applicant
and own a substantial financial interest in the venture. At the same time, it enables noncontrolling investors outside
the control group to provide essential capital to an applicant without their revenues, assets or net worth being attributed
to the applicant or their non-minority or male status disqualifying the applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
59. The Commission adopted two control group options in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the first option, passive investors are permitted to own up to 75 percent of the applicant's total equity, so
long as: (1) No investor holds more than 25 percent of the applicant's passive equity (which was subsequently defined
to include up to 15 percent of a corporation's voting stock); and (2) in the case of a corporate applicant, at least 50.1
percent of the voting stock is held by the control group. In the case of partnership applicants, the control group must
own all the general partnership interests. The Commission determined that this minimum equity level strikes an appropriate
balance between the competing considerations of permitting qualified bidders to raise capital and ensuring that
designated entities receive a significant economic benefit from the venture. The Commission extended an alternate
option to qualified women or minority-owned businesses. Under this option, the Commission would permit a single
investor in a minority or women-owned applicant to own up to 49.9 percent of the passive equity (which we subsequently
defined to include up to 15 percent of a corporation's voting stock), so long as the control group holds the remaining
50.1 percent of the equity. As with the first option, the control group is required to retain control and, in the case
of a corporate applicant, hold at least 50.1 percent of the voting stock. Also, ownership interests are to be calculated
on a fully diluted basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
60. Petitions filed by BET, Columbia PCS, CTIA, EATEL, Lehman Bros. and Omnipoint variously address the Commission's
restrictions on the composition of an applicant's control group. Specifically, petitioners request clarification
that our attribution rules and definitions of minority and women-owned business be interpreted to permit ``nonqualifying''
noncontrolling investors 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
within
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the control group. ``Nonqualifying'' investors, as petitioners describe, are investors that are neither women
nor minorities, or investors that if attributed would cause the applicant to exceed the financial caps. EATEL argues
that to do otherwise may preclude participation by existing companies whose existing corporate structures would
disqualify an applicant absent significant expenditures for corporate restructuring. EATEL maintains that existing
entities have the greatest amount to offer applicants in terms of financial and technical resources. Petitioners
also request that the Commission allow a limited amount of equity investment in the control group to help the applicant
comply with the 25 percent minimum equity requirement. Columbia PCS, for example, advocates adoption of a bright-line
test that would require at least a 75 percent equity and a 100 percent voting interest in the control group to be held
by ``qualifying'' entities. Columbia PCS maintains that designated entities will be unable to raise sufficient
capital unless this clarification is made. EATEL and CTIA maintain that the 100 percent equity requirement for minority
and women-owned control groups is too restrictive for entities already in existence. Instead, they argue that businesses
which are in fact 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
controlled
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by women and/or minorities, but which have numerous non-controlling shareholders (including some that are neither
women nor minorities), should be eligible for the preferences we adopted for minority and women-owned businesses.
BET also requests clarification that a control group may be comprised of a single individual.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
61. Omnipoint, Columbia PCS, CTIA and Lehman Brothers contend that the 25 percent minimum equity ownership restriction
is too high and that designated entities will face insurmountable difficulties arranging financing if it is not reduced.
To remedy this problem, Lehman Brothers proposes two alternative solutions. First, for publicly traded companies,
Lehman proposes that public shareholders with less than 5 percent equity should be counted towards the control group's
25 percent equity threshold. Lehman maintains that this proposal would permit control group equity to be diluted
by new shareholders, but not below a minimum equity level (Lehman recommends 10 percent). Second, Lehman suggests
that all designated entities should be permitted to dilute their 25 percent equity interests in the following circumstances:
(a) Not earlier than one year after license grant, to dilute control group equity to a total of not less than 20 percent;
(b) not earlier than two years, to dilute control group entity to a total of not less than 15 percent; and (c) not earlier
than three years to dilute control group equity to a total of not less than 10 percent. Lehman argues that this proposal
would provide designated entities efficient access to capital, thereby improving their competitive position.
CTIA recommends that an applicant should be eligible to bid on the C and F blocks with at least 10 percent equity. Lehaman
Brothers requests that the Commission modify its control group definition to provide that members of the control
group receive dividends, profits and regular and liquidating distributions in proportion to the actual possession
of equity held, rather than in proportion to their interest in the total equity of the applicant. Lehman Brothers contends
that our rules could be interpreted to mean that such distributions must be paid on options held but not exercised by
control group members, rather than on the basis of actual shares held.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
62. After considering the record, and as described below, we modify our rules to allow certain noncontrolling investors
who do not qualify for the entrepreneurs' block or as a small business to be investors in an applicant's control group.
We also allow entities that are controlled by minorities and/or women, but that have investors that are neither minorities
nor women, to be part of the control group. We agree with petitioners that some accommodation should be made in our regulations
to allow participation in an applicant's control group by existing firms controlled by designated entities or entrepreneurs
that have investors that, if attributed, would cause the applicant to exceed the small business or entrepreneurs'
blocks financial caps or, for minority or women-owned applicants, investors that are not minorities or women. We
will therefore modify our definition of a minority and women-owned business to include preexisting companies that
are controlled by women or minorities but have noncontrolling investors in the control group who are not minorities
or women. Similarly, we will allow preexisting companies that, in aggregate, meet our entrepreneurs' block and small
business size standards to be members of the control group even if one or more of the noncontrolling investors in those
companies would disqualify the company based on its gross revenues or total assets. We believe that these rule changes
will provide a reasonable balance between the need to ensure that designated entities have a significant economic
investment in the applicant and the financing realities of a PCS venture.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
63. We also agree with petitioners that it is not optimal to require the qualifying control group members to hold at
least 25 percent of the applicant's equity. The record indicates that in many cases, designated entities and entrepreneurial
principals will have limited capital to contribute to the applicant's equity and that nonontrolling investors will
be unwilling to advance funds to enable the designated entity (even one with management expertise) to reach the 25
percent threshold. Thus, without some modifications to our rules, designated entities could face insurmountable
difficulties in arranging financing. We therefore conclude that we should modify our rules to address petitioners'
concerns, while balancing the need to ensure meaningful equity participation by ``qualifying'' control group members.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
64. Specifically, we will retain the 25 percent minimum equity requirement for the control group, but we will require
only 15 percent (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 60 percent of the control group's 25 percent equity contribution) to be held by qualifying, controlling principals
in the control group (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 minorities, women or small/entrepreneurial business principals). For example, if the applicant seeks minority
or women-owned status, the 15 percent equity (as well as 50.1 percent of the voting stock of the applicant) must be owned
by control group members who are minorities and/or women. If the applicant seeks small business status, 15 percent
of the equity must be held by control group members who, in the aggregate, qualify as a small business.
<FOOTCITE>35</FOOTCITE>
 The composition of the principals of the control group determines whether the applicant qualifies for bidding credits,
installment payments and reduced upfront payments. The 15 percent may be held in the form of options, provided these
options are exercisable at any time, solely at the holder's discretion, and at an exercise price equal to or less than
the current market valuation of the underlying shares at the time of short-form filing. The remaining 10 percent (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 40 percent of the control group's minimum equity contribution) may be held in the form of either stock options or shares,
and we will allow certain investors that are not minorities, women, small businesses or entrepreneurs to hold interests
in such shares or options. Specifically, we will allow the 10 percent portion to be held in the form of shares or stock
options by: (1) Investors in the control group that are women, minorities, small businesses or entrepreneurs; (2)
individuals who are members of an applicant's management team (which could include individuals who are not minorities
or women or individuals who have affiliates that exceed the entrepreneurs' blocks or small business size thresholds);
(3) existing investors of businesses in the control group that were operating and earning revenues for two years prior
to December 31, 1994; or (4) noncontrolling institutional investors.

For instance, if a preexisting company wants to qualify as a small business control group, its gross revenues and total
assets will be added to the gross revenues and assets of each of its controlling shareholders and to those of all affiliates.
The resulting sum must be under $40 million in gross revenues and $500 million in total assets. The gross revenues and
total assets of the company's preexisting, noncontrolling shareholders will be ignored, however.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
65. The Commission also adopted an alternative to the 25 percent minimum equity requirement for minority and women-owned
businesses, which permits a single investor to hold as much as 49.9 percent of its equity, provided the control group
holds at least 50.1 percent. Several petitioners have expressed similar concerns with respect to the need to revise
the 50.1 percent requirements. Therefore, in tandem with, and for the same reasons as, the modifications to the 25
percent equity requirement, we make similar modifications to the rules governing the 50.1 percent minimum equity
requirement. Accordingly, where a minority or women-owned business uses the 50.1 percent minimum equity option,
we will require only 30 percent of the total equity to be held by the principals of the control group that are minorities
or women. The 30 percent may be held in the form of options, provided these options are exercisable at any time, solely
at the holder's discretion, and at an exercise price equal to or less than the current market valuation of the underlying
shares at the time of short-form filing. The remaining 20.1 percent may be made up of shares and/or options held by investors
that are not women or minorities under the same criteria described in paragraph 64 above. That is, the 20.1 percent
portion of the control group's equity may be held in the form of shares or stock options by any of the following: (1) Investors
in the control group that are minorities, women, small businesses or entrepreneurs; (2) individuals who are members
of an applicant's management team (which could include individuals who are not minorities or women, or individuals
who have affiliates that exceed the entrepreneurs' blocks and small business size standards); (3) existing investors
of businesses in the control group that were operating and earning revenues for two years prior to December 31, 1994;
or (4) noncontrolling institutional investors.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
For our purposes, we define institutional investors in a manner that is similar to the definition that is used by the
Commission in the attribution rules applied to assess compliance with the broadcast multiple ownership; rules.
We modify that definition slightly, however, to fit this service. Specifically, we expect that investment companies
will be important sources of capital formation for designated entities. Accordingly, we adopt a definition that
specifically includes venture capital firms and other smaller investment companies that may not be included in the
definition of investment companies found in 15 U.S.C. 80a-3 (which is cited in our broadcast rules at 47 CFR 73.3555
Note 2(c)). Specifically, we define an institutional investor as an insurance company, a bank holding stock in trust
accounts through its trust department, or an investment company as defined in 15 U.S.C. 80a-3(a) without reference
to, or incorporation of, the exemptions set forth in 15 U.S.C. 80a&hyph;3(b) and (c); provided that, if such investment
company is owned, in whole or in part, by other entities, then such investment company, such other entities and the
affiliates of such other entities, taken as a whole, must be primarily engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting
or trading in securities or in distributing or providing investment management services for securities.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
66. In addition, the control group minimum equity requirement will be reduced three years from the date of license
grant as suggested by Lehman Brothers, but the control group must still retain voting control (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 50.1 percent of the vote). According the control group the option to reduce the equity requirement accommodates the
needs of designated entity licensees to raise capita as they build out their systems. Significantly, the three-year
mark corresponds with the end of the no transfer period under our license holding rule. In the case of a licensee that
has chosen the 25 percent minimum equity option, the principals in the control group will only be required to hold 10
percent of the licensee's equity after three years, with no further equity requirements imposed on the control group.
Similarly, in the case of a licensee that has used the 50.1 percent minimum equity option, the principals in the control
group will be required to hold 20 percent of the licensee's equity, and no further equity requirements will be imposed
on the control group.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
67. After reviewing the record, we are persuaded that these changes will afford the control group greater flexibility
in raising the necessary equity for participation in the entrepreneurs' blocks. In particular, we are allowing that
10 (or 20.1) percent of the equity can come from sources that otherwise would not qualify for the control group. In making
these limited changes to the control group equity requirements, we believe the amended rules will: (1) promote investment
in designated entities generally; (2) attract and promote skilled management for applicants; and (3) encourage
involvement by existing firms that have valuable management skills and resources to contribute to the success of
applicants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
68. With respect to our decision to allow investment in the control group by investors of preexisting firms, the business
involved must be a going concern that has been in existence for a reasonable period of time prior to adoption of our rules
in order to avoid any sham arrangements. Specifically, the business involved must have been operating and earning
revenues for at least two years prior to December 31, 1994 to qualify for this provision. While we want to relax the control
group equity requirements slightly, we also recognize there may be an incentive for nonqualifying investors to purchase
substantial interests in ``preexisting'' businesses unless we place some restrictions on those investors. As a
practical matter, however, we realize that the identity of noncontrolling investors in such businesses, particularly
if they are publicly-traded companies, will change regularly. We intend that the allowed equity (10 or 20.1 percent)
portion should be held by existing investors in such a company although we will not place limits on who qualifies as
such an investor. We emphasize, however, that we will scrutinize any significant equity restructing of preexisting
companies that occurs after adoption of our rules. We would presume that any change of equity by an investor in a preexisting
company (that is in an applicant's control group) that is five percent or less would not be significant, and the burden
is on the applicant to demonstrate whether changes in equity that exceed five percent are not significant.

69. We also agree with petitioners and commenters that greater flexibility should be afforded to any applicant whose
ownership structures were established before our designated entity requirements were formulated. Therefore,
as a further modification, if the sole control group member of an applicant is a business that was in existence and had
earnings from operations for at least two years prior to December 31, 1994, we offer the option that control group principals
establishing the applicant's status as a minority and/or women-owned business, small or entrepreneurial business
may hold 10 percent of the applicant's equity if the 25 percent equity option is used, or a 20 percent equity interest
if the 50.1 percent equity option is used.
<FOOTCITE>37</FOOTCITE>
 The balance of the control group's equity contribution (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 15 or 30.1 percent) must be held in the form of shares or stock options by any of the following: (1) Qualifying principals
in the control group; (2) individuals who are members of the applicant's management team (which could include ``nonqualifying''
individuals); or (3) existing investors of business in the control group that were operating and earning revenues
for two years prior to December 31, 1994.

This equity may be held outright or in the form of options provided these options are exercisable at any time, solely
at the holder's discretion, and at an exercise price equal to or less than the current market valuation of the underlying
shares at the time of the filing of the short-form application.

70. The lower equity requirement of 10 percent for preexisting companies that are sole control group members addresses
the concerns of these firms, many of which have already undergone successive rounds of financing that may have diluted
the qualifying investors' original equity interest in the business. Existing firms that were structured prior to
the adoption of the entrepreneurs' blocks regulatory scheme are less likely to become ``fronts'' for business that
would not qualify for the entrepreneurs' block or the special provisions accorded designated entities. This option
is solely intended to accommodate long-standing capital structures of applicants that have already been required
to dilute equity ownership to raise capital. Thus, we will require that the portion of equity not held by qualifying
principals (15 or 30.1 percent, as the case may be) to be comprised entirely of existing investors of the company (unless
the equity is held by management or qualified principals of the control group). As we stated above, we recognize that
for many companies, especially those that are publicly-traded, the identities of noncontrolling investors change
regularly. Thus we will not place limits on the amount of time a particular individual or entity must have been an investor
in the company. We emphasize, however, that we will scrutinize carefully applicants that engage in significant equity
reshuffling after adoption of our rules.
<FOOTCITE>38</FOOTCITE>
 By giving preexisting applicants additional flexibility, we do not intend to place other applicants at a competitive
disadvantage by permitting greater capital infusion from institutional investors.

71. In implementing our requirements, we will provide that where the interests in question are not held directly in
the applicant, a multiplier will be used to calculate the effective interests held by the control group principals
toward fulfillment of the minimum equity requirement. In addition, we will use a multiplier to calculate the interests
of noncontrolling investors in the control group so as to assess compliance with the 25 percent nonattributable equity
limit.
<FOOTCITE>39</FOOTCITE>
 A multiplier is a traditional tool used by the Commission to calculate the effective ownership levels of investors
that, through one or more intervening corporations, hold indirect interests in a licensee.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
We illustrate the application of a multiplier as follows: If a member of a minority group or a woman holds a 25 percent
equity interest in a corporate member of the control group and that corporation holds a 25 percent equity interest
in the applicant, the effective interest for purposes of assessing compliance with the minimum equity requirement
would be 6.25 percent (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
0.25 &times; 0.25 = 6.25). This falls well below the 25 percent requirement of our original rule. Correspondingly,
if a noncontrolling (and nonqualifying) investor holds a 40 percent interest in a corporate member of a control group
and that corporation holds 25 percent of the applicant's total equity, the effective interest held in the applicant
by the investor would be 10 percent (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
0.25 &times; .40 = 10.00). If that same investor also owns more than 15 percent of the applicant's equity outside of
the control group, it would exceed the 25 percent non-attributable equity limit.

presentation, Metricom requests that we exempt small, publicly-traded corporations with widely dispersed voting
stock ownership from our control group requirement. Metricom contends that the control group concept is unworkable
for small, publicly-traded companies, because it would not be possible to identify a group of shareholders that own
50.1 percent of the corporation's voting stock. As a result, such corporations could be unable to establish eligibility
for the entrepreneurs' blocks, or status as a small business. Metricom proposes a test for identifying small, publicly-traded
corporations with widely-dispersed voting stock ownership that closely follows guidelines used by the Securities
and Exchange Commission.

73. We will adopt Metricom's proposal, and create a limited exemption from the control group requirement for small,
publicly-traded corporations with widely dispersed voting stock ownership. As Metricom points out, a significant
number of small, publicly traded companies have such widely dispersed voting stock ownership that no identifiable
control group exists or can be created. Without a control group, such companies may not be able to bid for entrepreneurs'
block licenses or quality for small business status even though their gross revenues and assets meet our financial
caps. It was not the Commission's intent that these companies be denied the opportunity to bid on the entrepreneurs
block, or to qualify for treatment as a small business.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
74. Consistent with Metricom's proposal, a small, publicly-traded corporation will be found to have dispersed ownership
of voting stock if no person (including any ``group'' as that term is used in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934)
<FOOTCITE>41</FOOTCITE>
 has the power to control the election of more than 15 percent of the corporation's directors. In addition, we will require
that no person shall have an equity interest in the applicant for more than 15 percent, which is consistent with out
revised equity requirements for small business applicants utilizing a control group. Under those requirements
small business principals in an applicant's control group must hold at least 15 percent interest in the applicant
(in combination with an additional, 10 percent equity interest that may come from ``nonqualifying'' sources). A
15 percent equity requirement is appropriate here because the same percentage of equity is needed for a small business
applicant's control group to satisfy its equity obligations (unless it is a preexisting company), and because a 15
percent equity cap is likely to ensure that no control questions arise. We, emphasize that this control group exemption
will only apply to an applicant or licensee that is not controlled by any entity or group other than corporate management,
as should be the case where there is no identifiable group of shareholders holding a controlling interest in the company's
voting stock. A small corporation that has dispersed voting stock ownership and no controlling affiliates will therefore
not be required to aggregate with its own revenues and assets the revenues and assets of management and shareholders
for purposes of entrepreneurs' block eligibility or small business status.

75. Small, publicly-traded corporations that choose to exempt themselves from the control group requirement must
own all the equity and voting stock of the applicant or licensee. We find their ability to reply on the corporation's
existing capital structure to introduce new passive investment on an ongoing basis provides a level of flexibility
that is comparable to applicants/licensees with an identifiable control group. We note that minority and/or women-owned
businesses would not qualify for this exemption since a control group is necessary to determine whether the applicant
is controlled by minorities or women.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
76. Finally we consider a few other points. First, as BET requests, we clarify that an individual can be the control
group of an applicant, so long as our equity requirements and other provisions are satisfied. In response to Lehman
Brothers' concerns, we clarify the control group requirements to provide that control group investors must receive
dividends, profits, and regular and liquidating distributions in proportion to their actual possession of equity
holdings, rather than in proportion to their interest in the total equity (which may include options not yet exercised).
Finally, we see no conflict in our rules with a Pacific Telesis' proposal to allow designated entities and their partners
to allocate amongst themselves tax benefits on a non-pro rata basis.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 control in this context. We therefore clarify that a designated entity or entrepreneurs' control group must demonstrate
at least the following indicia of control to establish that it retains 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 control of the applicant (1) The control group must constitute or appoint more than 50 percent of the board of directors
or partnership management committee; (2) the control group must have authority to appoint, promote, demote and fire
senior executives that control the day-to-day activities of the licensee; (3) the control group must play in integral
role in all major management decisions; and (4) in the case of applicants controlled by minorities and women, at least
one minority or female control group member must have senior managerial responsibility over day-to-day operations,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as President or CEO of the licensee.
<FOOTCITE>44</FOOTCITE>
 We emphasize, however, that these criteria are guidelines only and are not necessarily dispositive of the issue of

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

These same four indicia will be used to determine whether the ``qualified'' members of the control group (

 control over the control group. For example, in a women-owned limited partnership applicant with one corporate general

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
81. With respect to provisions benefitting non-majority or non-voting shareholders, we recognize that inclusion
of such provisions in a common practice to induce investment and ensure that the basic interests of such shareholders
are protected. For example, many corporations require a supermajority of shareholders to approve major corporate
decisions such as taking on additional debt, significant corporate acquisitions, or issuance of new stock. Similarly,
strategic investors making large passive equity contributions to a company frequently insist on a right of first
refusal exercisable in the event that a third party seeks to purchase the company. We agree with petitioners that allowing
such provisions enhances the ability of designated entities to raise needed capital from strategic investors, thereby
bolstering their financial stability and competitive viability. We believe, however, that precedent provides
guidance in determining the appropriate extent to which these safeguards may protect investment. We therefore clarify
that under our case law non-majority or non-voting shareholders may be given a decision-making role (through supermajority
provisions or similar mechanisms) in major corporate decisions that fundamentally affect their interests as shareholders
without being deemed to be in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 control.
<FOOTCITE>45</FOOTCITE>
 Such decisions generally include: (1) Issuance or reclassification of stock; (2) setting compensation for senior
management; (3) expenditures that significantly affect market capitalization; (4) incurring significant corporate
debt or otherwise encumbering corporate assets; (5) sale of major corporate assets; and (6) fundamental changes
in corporate structure, including merger or dissolution.
<FOOTCITE>46</FOOTCITE>
 We also clarify that non-majority or non-voting investors may hold rights of first refusal, provided that right is
exercisable only to prevent dilution of the investor's interest or a transfer of control by the control group to a third
party. We also observe that we would not look favorably upon an assignment or transfer of a license that resulted from
rights of first refusal being exercised if (1) the holder of such rights was a manager of the licensee, and (2) there
was evidence the manager had not acted to maximize the profitability of the business in order to ensure that the options
would be exercised at a lower price.

do not in and of themselves represent the type of transfer of corporate control envisioned by Section 310(d) of the
Communications Act. We found it significant, however, that while BT could block certain major transactions by MCI,
BT could not compel MCI to engage in such major transactions. Thus, we concluded that BT's power was permissibly limited
to protecting its own investment in MCI.

de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 control, some proposals made by petitioners and comments to benefit non-majority shareholders would violate this
standard. For example, non-majority shareholders should not have the power to select or replace members of the control
group or key employees of the corporation. Further, as discussed in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 in this docket, we do not intend to restrict the use of preferential dividends and liquidation preferences. We will
scrutinize, however, any mechanisms that deprive the control group of the ability to realize a financial benefit
proportional to its ownership of the applicant. Finally, we emphasize that any final determination of whether a control
group has yielded 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 control to outside investors must depend on the circumstances of the particular case. For example, while certain
provisions benefitting non-majority investors may not give rise to a transfer of control when considered individually,
the aggregate effect of multiple provisions could be sufficient to deprive the control group of

 Under this test, a licensee may enter into a management agreement with a third party provided that the licensee retains
exclusive responsibility for operation and control of the licensed facilities, as determined by the following six
factors: (1) Unfettered use of licensed facilities and equipment; (2) day-to-day operation and control; (3) determination
of and carrying out of policy decisions; (4) employment, supervision, and dismissal of personnel; (5) payment of
financial obligations; and (6) receipt of profits from operation of the licensed facilities.

 test and argues that further guidance from the Commission is therefore needed to prevent sham agreements between
designated entities and third party managers. Other parties also support the view that the Commission should clarify
its standards regarding management contracts, but do not necessarily agree about what standard should be anticipated.
NABOB, for example, argues that the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Intermountain
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 test is too rigid and that a more flexible standard should be applied to designated entities who enter into management
agreements. Columbia PCS, on the other hand, contends that the Commission should apply a stricter standard by limiting
managers to performing discrete functions on a subcontractor basis as opposed to assuming broad responsibility
for system management.

 we reaffirm the applicability of the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Intermountain
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 factors provide reasonable benchmarks for ensuring retention of control by the licensee while allowing for full
consideration of the circumstances in each case. In the case of designated entity applicants, they will ensure that
designated entities participate actively in the day-to-day management of the company while allowing reasonable
flexibility to obtain services from outside experts as well. We believe that relaxing the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

that such contracts should be subject to a stricter standard than we have applied previously. We conclude that limiting
managers to discrete ``subcontractor'' functions, as Columbia PCS proposes, could prevent designated entities
from drawing on managers with broad expertise. Moreover, whether a manager undertakes a large number of operational
functions is irrelevant to the issue of control so long as ultimate responsibility for those functions resides with
the licensee.

 parties have debated our decision to raise the voting equity threshold for closely-held applicants from five to 15
percent. AIDE argues that raising the voting level of closely-held applicants is imprudent because it increases
the likelihood that big business will control the applicant. AMP disagrees with AIDE that 15 percent voting control
would increase the likelihood of shams, because 15 percent is still not a controlling percentage. Rather, AMP argues
that increasing the permissible level of voting equity will enable applicants to attract more equity financing,
thereby increasing the applicant's likelihood of success.

89. We amend our attribution rules to raise the voting equity threshold that qualifies an investor as having an attributable
interest in an applicant to 25 percent. We will raise the voting equity level for both publicly-traded and closely-held
corporations, and will apply the 25-percent threshold for the 25/75-percent equity option available to all applicants
and to the 49.9/50.1 percent equity option additionally available to minority and/or women applicants. We observe
that 25 percent is the percentage suggested by both CTIA and BET. We agree with CTIA that investors will be more likely
to invest in new companies if they have the ability to protect their investment through increased voting rights. We
also agree that a 25-percent voting interest will not convey a significantly greater risk of control than a 15-percent
voting interest. BET asserts that higher voting thresholds will enable a larger number of existing companies_those
which have established financial structures with a higher percentage of voting stock owned by non-controlling stockholders_to
compete in the entrepreneurial block. Furthermore, in other contexts, Congress has used a 25-percent threshold
as a measure of determining control. For example, under Section 310(b) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 310(b),
foreign companies are permitted to directly or indirectly control up to 25 percent of CMRS licensees. We believe that
in this context as well, a 25-percent threshold strikes an appropriate balance between the need to encourage investment
and our goal of ensuring that designated entities remain in clear control. Finally, for purposes of clarification,
the maximum permissible nonattributable equity level may be no greater than 25 percent of the applicant's total equity
and includes the right to vote such share (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

For example, an investor holding 25 percent of an applicant's voting stock will not be considered a nonattributable
equity investor if it also has the right, through a voting trust or other arrangement, to vote additional shares.

90. Additionally, however, to discourage large investors from circumventing our equity limitations for nonattributable
investors, we clarify that persons or entities that are affiliates of one another, or that have an ``identity of interests,''
will be treated as though they were one person or entity and their ownership interests aggregated for purposes of determining
compliance with our maximum nonattributable equity limits. We will aggregate their ownership interests in calculating
their total equity interests in the applicant and in determining whether their gross revenues and assets will be attributed
to the applicant. Thus, for example, if two entities form a joint venture or consortium to apply for broadband PCS A
and B block licenses, they have an identity of interests that is characteristic of affiliates, and will be treated
as a single entity when investing in the same entrepreneurs' block applicant.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 commenters request that we clarify our rules regarding the treatment of various ownership instruments such as warrants,
stock options and convertible debentures. Additionally, commenters have asked whether rights of first refusal
are considered options and how stock ``calls'' and ``puts'' will be treated. A ``put'' option gives the holder the
right to sell a share of stock at a specified price at any time up to the expiration date. Conversely, a ``call'' option
gives the holder the right to buy a share of stock at a specified price, known as the ``exercise price.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
93. In general, we will treat stock options as fully exercised with the exception of some ownership instruments. We
recognize that some forms of options are common and often beneficial to the management of a company. Many companies,
for example, include stock options in senior management compensation packages. We also recognize that treating
options as fully exercised will encourage companies to hire minorities and women for top management positions, because
any options they receive will count toward the equity eligibility requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
94. We decide that for purposes of calculating ownership interests, however, some ownership instruments will not
be treated as ``fully diluted'', or will not be considered options generally. For example, we will not consider rights
of first refusal as options when calculating ownership interests.
<FOOTCITE>56</FOOTCITE>
 Rights of first refusal differ from other types of options because they cannot be exercised unless there is a proposed
sale to a third party. Sales and transfers to third parties are restricted during the holding period, so rights of first
refusal do not threaten the composition of designated entities.
<FOOTCITE>57</FOOTCITE>
 At the end of the five-year period, it will still be the designated entity's decision as to whether to sell the business,
which ensures that the designated entity controls the decision whether to sell. We agree that without these rights,
investors are likely to shy away from investing in designated entities. As Pacific Telesis and BellSouth point out,
rights of first refusal are a valued safeguard mechanism because they give investors some control over the entry of
new business associates. They also enable investors to prevent their own shares from becoming dilutes as a result
of a sale.

95. ``Put'' options held by the designated entity_which can be realized only after the licensee can permissibly transfer
the license_will not be treated as fully diluted for purposes of determining ownership interests. Put options held
by the designated entity leave the ownership decision in the designated entity's control and do not force an unwanted
sale upon the designated entity. We observe, however, that while such options will not be factored in for purposes
of determining 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de jure
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 control, we will continue to look at whether put options in combination with other terms to an agreement deprive an
otherwise qualified control group of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 control over the applicant. Thus, a ``put'' in combination with other terms to an agreement may result in an applicant
not retaining 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 control. For example, if an agreement between a strategic investor and a designated entity provides that (1) the investor
makes debt financing available to the applicant on very favorable terms (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 15-year term, no payments of principal or interest for six years) and (2) that the designated entity has a one-time
put right that is exercisable at a time and under conditions that are designed to maximize the incentive of the licensee
to sell (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 six years after issue, option to put partnership interest in lieu of payment of principal and accrued interest on loan),
we may conclude that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 control has been relinquished. ``Call'' options held by investors will be considered exercised immediately to calculate
ownership levels because they can be used to force a designated entity to sell its ownership interests. Finally, we
observe that such a call option would vest an impermissible degree of control in the applicant's so-called ``noncontrolling''
investors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
96. In summary, agreements between designated entities and strategic investors that involve terms (such as management
contracts combined with rights of first refusal, loans, puts, etc.) that cumulatively are designed financially
to force the designated entity into a sale (or major refinancing) will constitute a transfer of control under our rules.
We will look at the totality of circumstances in each particular case. We emphasize that our concerns are greatly increased
when a single entity provides most of the capital and management services and is the beneficiary of the investor protections.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we determine that bidding credits were necessary to better ensure that women and minority-owned businesses and small
businesses have meaningful opportunities to participate in broadband PCS. Accordingly, our rules provided that
small businesses will receive a 10 percent credit, women and minority-owned businesses will receive a 15 percent
credit, and small businesses owned by women and minorities will receive an aggregate credit of 25 percent.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to enhance the effectiveness of the entrepreneurs' blocks through the addition of bidding credits reflected our
expectation that broadband PCS will be a capital intensive undertaking. We stated that bidding credits would function
as a discount on the bid price a firm will actually have to pay to obtain a license and, thus, would directly address the
obstacles to raising capital encountered by small, women and minority-owned firms.

98. Several petitioners request that we increase the level of bidding credits. For example, while some petitioners
argue in favor of higher bidding credits for all designated entities, others seek to raise the bidding credit for women
and minority-owned businesses, or only for minority-owned small businesses. Many of these petitioners find support
in our

 in this docket, where we raised the bidding credit for minority and women-owned businesses bidding on regional narrowband
PCS licenses from 25 percent to 40 percent.
<FOOTCITE>59</FOOTCITE>
 Two petitioners contend that rural telephone companies should receive a 10 percent bidding credit, that would be
cumulative with any other bidding credits for which the applicant would be eligible. Finally, consistent with its
argument that the entrepreneurs' blocks should be abolished, GTE supports availability of bidding credits across
all broadband PCS channel blocks.

99. We will retain our existing bidding credit scheme. Present levels of bidding credits, coupled with other provisions
directed at the capital formation problems of designated entities, such as size limitations on the entrepreneurs'
block and installment payments, are sufficient to achieve our regulatory objectives. Moreover, additional measures
that we have adopted on reconsideration, including elimination of the limits on personal net worth and relaxation
on the attribution of affiliates owned and controlled by minorities, will further enhance the value of the bidding
credits to women and minority-owned firms in particular. We find that our action on reconsideration of the narrowband
PCS auction rules does not dictate raising the bidding credit in this instance. As the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Third Memorandum Opinion and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 makes clear, the 40 percent bidding credit for women and minorities bidding on regional narrowband PCS licenses was
adopted in the absence of any entrepreneurs' blocks. Further, we state that in the insulated entrepreneurs' block
setting, a 25 percent bidding credit for minority and/or women-owned small firms is more appropriate. We also find
that the record does not support creation of a new bidding credit for rural telephone companies. In this regard, we
agree with BET that petitioners have failed to demonstrate a historical lack of access to capital that was the basis
for according bidding credits to small businesses, minorities and women. To the extent that a rural telephone company
is also a small business, or minority or women-owned, then bidding credits would, of course, be available. We also
decline to adopt GTE's scheme to eliminate the entrepreneurs' blocks, and distribute bidding credits throughout
the broadband PCS channel blocks. As Omnipoint, Columbia PCS and ET observe, the insulation provided by the entrepreneurs'
block is key to the utility of bidding credits in such a capital intensive undertaking.

Installment Payments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
100. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we made installment payments available to most businesses that obtain entrepreneurs' block licenses. Installment
payments directly address the significant barriers that smaller businesses face in accessing private financing.
With the expectation of enormous costs associated with obtaining and operating a broadband PCS license, installment
payments provide low-cost government financing that reduces the amount of private financing needed before and after
the auction. Our installment payment plan was made available to all entrepreneurs' block eligibles granted licenses
in the 50 largest BTAs. In the smaller BTAs where the costs of license acquisition and operation are expected to be lower,
installment payments are only available to licensees owned by women and minorities, and licensees with less than
$75 million in gross revenues. We also provided an ``enhanced'' installment payment plan for small businesses and
businesses owned by women and minorities where interest-only payments were required for such entities for as long
as five years from the date of license grant if the firm is both small and owned by women or minorities. By tailoring the
deferral of principal payments to the needs of the particular designated entities, we promoted greater participation
in broadband PCS by viable competitors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
101. Vanguard asks us to offer installment payments to all entrepreneurs' block winners for all BTAs. Without this
relief, Vanguard contends that small cellular carriers that are, in fact, more likely to serve the smaller markets
would be forced to comply with the same payment schedule as large carriers bidding for smaller markets. SBPCS seeks
to eliminate interest on installment payments altogether, and limit availability of installment payment plans
to revenue less than $75 million dollars. Hernandez requests that the Commission require bidders to demonstrate
their ability to meet the terms of an installment payment plan when the short-form application is filed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
102. We will extend availability of installment payments to all entrepreneurs' block licensees, regardless of gross
revenues. A key factor to the overall success of the entrepreneurs' blocks is the installment payment plan. The installment
plan was established to facilitate the entry of small and minority-owned businesses into the broadband PCS market.
The top 50 BTAs will be the most competitive wireless communications markets in the country and will require inordinately
large amounts of capital. It will be extremely challenging for any entrepreneurs' block participant to compete in
these markets. The installment plans will greatly enhance the ability of all entrepreneurs' block participants
to raise capital to succeed against major, well-capitalized competitors. As Vanguard points out, disallowing installment
payments to large entrepreneurs' block winners of small BTAs unfairly restricts these companies from competing
for markets in which they will have a logical interest. In addition, the larger entrepreneurs would be forced to pay
for BTAs on the same terms as major companies that do not qualify for the entrepreneurs' blocks. While we accept these
arguments, and therefore extend installment payments to all entrepreneur's block licensees, we note that the terms
of these payments should be less generous than those extended to smaller companies, less able to access traditional
sources of capital. Therefore, we will require entrepreneurs with gross revenues exceeding $75 million to make a
post-auction down payment equaling ten percent of their winning bids, but then pay the remaining 90 percent of the
auction price in installments with interest charges to be fixed at the time of licensing at a rate equal to that for ten-year
U.S. Treasury obligations plus 3.5 percent, with payments on both interest and principal required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
103. We decline to reduce or eliminate interest rates entirely because we believe that the present approach achieves
the proper balance among our regulatory objectives. In particular, our present tailoring of interest rates to the
needs of the designated entity enables licenses to be disseminated to small businesses and furthers the congressional
goal of allowing taxpayers to reap a portion of the value of the licenses. Reducing or eliminating interest payments
could result in very high bids, which could reduce competition and promote defaults among entrepreneurs. Such an
approach could also encourage speculation instead of legitimate applicants who can attract capital. On our own motion,
however we will amend 47 C.F.R. &sect;24.711 to permit small businesses owned by minorities and/or women to make interest-only
payments for six years from the date of license grant. Under our current rules, principal payments start to come due
at the same time the entrepreneur is permitted to transfer the license and immediately following the first, build-out
requirement. By deferring payment of principal an additional year, we intend to assist the designated entity in avoiding
an unwanted sale of business at the five-year mark in order to avoid payment of principal. Finally, for the reasons
discussed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fourth Memorandum Opinion and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
we believe that our existing requirements for broadband PCS auction applicants adequately measure an applicant's
ability to pay.
<FOOTCITE>60</FOOTCITE>
 We therefore decline to impose more stringent requirements to determine whether an applicant can meet the terms of
an installment payment plan.

104. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the Commission established several provisions to help rural telephone companies become meaningful participants
in the emerging PCS market. In that proceeding, we defined a rural telephone company as a local exchange carrier having
100,000 or fewer access lines, including all affiliates. In departing from the more restrictive definition adopted
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the Commission stated that the revised definition strikes an appropriate balance by facilitating the rapid deployment
of broadband PCS to rural areas, without giving benefits to large companies that do not require special assistance.
Qualified rural telephone companies are eligible for broadband PCS licenses through a partitioning system, which
permits rural telephone companies to obtain licenses that are geographically partitioned from larger PCS service
areas. These companies will be permitted to acquire partitioned broadband PCS licenses in any frequency block in
two ways: (l) they may form bidding consortia consisting entirely of rural telephone companies to participate in
the auctions, and then partition the licenses won among consortia participants; and (2) they may acquire partitioned
broadband PCS licenses from other licensees through private negotiation and agreement either before or after the
auction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
105. Under our rules, if a rural telephone company receives a partitioned license from another PCS licensee in a post-auction
transaction, the partitioned area must be reasonably related to the rural telephone company's wireline service
area that lies within the PCS service area. We recognized in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
that rural telephone companies will require some flexibility in fashioning areas in which they will receive partitioned
licenses, so we did not adopt a strict rule concerning the reasonableness of the partitioned area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

106. Petitioners variously request the Commission modify our rural telephone company provisions. Century Telephone
Enterprises, Inc. (Century) and Citizens Utilities Company (Citizens) argue that the rural telephone company definition
adopted in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
is overly restrictive and excludes local exchange carriers that exceed the access line standard but nevertheless
serve predominantly rural areas. Alternatively, Citizens requests the Commission implement waiver procedures.
In addition, Hicks and Ragland and TEC urge the Commission to eliminate its partitioned service area limitations,
stating that the present rules unnecessarily impede the ability of a rural telephone company to provide service in
a technically and economically feasible manner. Finally, MEANS/SDN and TEC contend the rural telephone companies
should be afforded the same benefits as other designated entities, including outside passive investment in rural
telephone company consortia and bidding credits.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
107. We generally will retain the rural telephone company provisions adopted in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We remain convinced that our definition of rural telephone company, which reflects the views of numerous parties
to this proceeding, will ensure that broadband PCS will be deployed rapidly to rural areas. At the same time, it is narrowly
tailored to exclude large local exchange carriers that do not require special treatment. We observe that we can entertain
and grant a waiver request if a local exchange carrier that does not satisfy our rural telephone company definition
can meet our waiver standard set forth in Section 24.819 of the Commission's Rules to warrant qualifying the LEC for
a partitioned broadband PCS license.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
108. We continue to believe that our existing rules, which allow rural telephone companies to obtain broadband PCS
licenses that are geographically partitioned from larger PCS service areas, will provide a viable opportunity for
these entities to successfully acquire PCS licenses and offer service to rural areas. We are confident that the partitioning
system articulated in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
satisfies the directive of Congress to ensure that rural telephone companies have the opportunity to provide PCS
services to all areas of the country, including rural areas. In addition, we believe that the other benefits afforded
to designated entities, combined with the cellular attribution threshold for rural telephone companies adopted
in Gen. Docket No. 90&hyph;314, will further ensure that rural areas have expedient access to PCS services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
109. We disagree with MEANS/SDN's contention that modifications to our consortia provisions are needed to fulfill
Congress' mandate that rural telephone companies have an opportunity to acquire PCS licenses. As we noted in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
we expect that virtually all rural telephone company consortia will be eligible to bid on licenses in Blocks C and F
without competition from ``deep pocket'' bidders. Additionally, if consortia members qualify as small businesses,
the Commission will provide the bidding credit and installment payment provisions extended to similarly-situated
applicants. Accordingly, we believe it is unnecessary to permit passive equity investments in rural telephone company
consortia, as MEANS/SDN requests. Indeed we do not extend similar benefits to small, non-rural telephone businesses
that form bidding consortia.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
110. We also reject TEC's and MEANS/SDN's proposal to extend bidding credits to rural telephone companies even if
they are not small businesses or owned by minorities and/or women. We continue to believe that existing benefits for
rural telephone companies will allow them to effectively compete for licenses that serve rural territories. In addition
to the partitioning and consortia provisions, we also note that rural telephone companies qualify for significant
financial benefits from the Rural Electrification Administration and the Universal Service Fund, which as BET suggests,
adequately compensates these entities for the lack of bidding credits. Additionally, we note that our bidding credits
were specifically tailored to address the discriminatory market barriers faced by women and minority-owned entities.
We concur with BET's assessment that rural telephone companies do not face the same kinds of barriers raising capital.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
111. We note that most, if not all, rural telephone companies meet the entrepreneurs' block size standards and are
permitted to bid directly on entrepreneurs' blocks licenses. To the extent that a rural telephone company does not
qualify for the entrepreneurs' blocks, however, we disagree that it will be forced to negotiate with other licensees
that may not be willing to sell their broadband PCS interests in the from of partitioned licenses or other ownership
arrangements. On the contrary, we believe that other applicants and licensees will find rural telephone companies
attractive entities to negotiate with, because of the efficiencies associated with rural telephone companies existing
infrastructure. Additionally, since a licensee will be permitted to assign a portion of its license to a rural telephone
company without violating the transfer and holding requirements, we expect that licensees will actively solicit
participation by rural telephone companies. For the reasons discussed above, we continue to believe that our existing
scheme, which is narrowly tailored to satisfy Congress' mandate, will provide rural telephone companies with a meaningful
opportunity to participate in the provision of broadband PCS services and further the objective of rapidly getting
service to rural areas.

112. Finally, we dismiss concerns raised by TEC and Hicks and Ragland concerning the permissible size of a rural telephone
company's service area. We addressed these concerns in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and concluded that a partitioned area containing no more than twice the population of that portion of a rural telephone
company's wireline service area provides a reasonable presumption of a permissible service territory. However,
we agree that rural telephone companies will require some flexibility in fashioning a partitioned service area and
thereby affirm our prior conclusion that a strict rule is not needed.

in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
restrict the number of licenses within the entrepreneurs' block that a single entity may win at auction. Specifically,
we impose a limitation that no single entity may win more than 10 percent of the licenses available in the entrepreneurs'
blocks, or 98 licenses. We indicated that the 98 licenses may all be in frequency block C or all in frequency block F,
or in some combination of the two blocks. We observed that such a limit would ensure that at least 10 winning bidders
enjoy the benefits of the entrepreneurs' blocks, while also allowing bidders to effectuate aggregation strategies
that include large numbers of licenses and extensive geographic coverage. We provided that the limit would apply
only to the total number of licenses that may be won at auction on the C and F blocks. Furthermore, we indicated that for
purposes of this restriction we will consider licenses to be won by the same entity if an applicant (or other entity)
that controls, or has the power to control licenses won at the auction, controls or has the power to control another
license at the auction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
114. On reconsideration, the Small Business PCS Association (SBPCS) recommends that the maximum number of entrepreneurs'
block licenses purchased by a single entity be limited to licenses that cover no more than a total of 10 percent of the
national population, or approximately 25 million ``pops.'' SBPCS expresses concern that the existing limit does
not provide for enough diversity of ownership since it would allow a single entity to acquire the top 98 BTA licenses
on the 30 MHz entrepreneurs' blocks.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
115. After considering SBPCS' concerns, we will retain the existing limit, which prevents any single entity from
acquiring more than 10 percent of the entrepreneurs' block licenses. We believe that changing the limit to 10 percent
of the population or 25 million ``pops'' rule would be overly restrictive. We note, for example, that successful entrepreneurs
will need to form coherent regional ``cluster'' strategies to compete against large communications companies,
such as dominant cellular providers, and that such regional clusters may come together into a national alliance with
common technology and marketing strategies, including a common brand name. A 25 million ``pops'' per entity limit
would severely restrict entrepreneurs that win the New York BTA (with 18 million ``pops'') and the Los Angeles BTA
(with 15 million ``pops'') from any meaningful regional cluster strategy, given the size of adjoining markets. In
light of this concern, we want to be careful not to impose a restriction that would unfairly disadvantage C and F block
new entrants in the new PCS marketplace. We are satisfied that the present limit achieves the proper balance between
promoting fair distribution of benefits and ensuring that entrepreneur block winners have enough flexibility to
develop competitive systems on a regional and nationwide basis.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
restrictions on the transfer or assignment of licenses were adopted to ensure that designated entities do not take
advantage of special entrepreneurs' block provisions by immediately assigning or transferring control of their
licenses to non-designated entities. We indicated that the ``trafficking'' of licenses in this manner would unjustly
enrich the auction winners and would undermine the congressional objective of giving designated entities the opportunity
to provide spectrum-based services. Thus, our rules prohibit licensees in the entrepreneurs' blocks from voluntarily
assigning or transferring control of their licenses during the three years after the date of the license grant.
<FOOTCITE>61</FOOTCITE>
 For the subsequent two years (or the fourth and fifth years of the term), the licensee is permitted to assign or transfer
control of its authorization only to an entity that satisfies the entrepreneurs' blocks entry criteria.

117. We also provided that during the five-year period licensees cannot assign an attributable interest in the license
that would cause them to exceed the financial eligibility requirements.
<FOOTCITE>62</FOOTCITE>
 Additionally, we stated that a transferee or assignee who receives a C or F block license during the five-year holding
period will remain subject to the transfer restrictions for the balance of the holding period. Thus, if a C-block authorization
is assigned to an eligible business in year four of the license term, it will be required to hold that license until the
original five-year period expires, subject to the same exceptions that applied to the original licensee. Moreover,
we stated that we will conduct random pre- and post-auction audits to ensure that applicants receiving preferences
are in compliance with the Commission's rules.

, we also adopted rules to prevent entrepreneur block license holders from realizing any unjust enrichment that is
gained through a transfer or assignment that occurs during the original license term.
<FOOTCITE>64</FOOTCITE>
 Specifically, we provided that if, within the original license term, a licensee applies to assign or transfer control
of a license to an entity that is not eligible for as high a level of bidding credit, then the difference between the bidding
credit obtained by the assigning party and the bidding credit for which the acquiring party would qualify, must be
paid to the U.S. Treasury as a condition of approval of the transfer or assignment.

While we indicated that the five-year holding and limited transfer requirements in the entrepreneurs' blocks limit
the applicability of unjust enrichment provisions generally during the first five-years of the license term (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
, in cases where the license-holder has engaged in a permissible transfer or assignment where the buyer is eligible
for comparable bidding credits or is qualified for installment payments), we indicated that such provisions were
still useful, particularly since they are applicable for the full ten-year license term.

119. We adopted similar requirements with respect to repayment of installment payments. Specifically, if a licensee
that was awarded installment payments seeks to assign or transfer control of its license during the term of a license
to an entity not meeting the applicable eligibility standards, we require payment of the remaining principal and
any interest accrued through the date of assignment as a condition of approval of the transfer or assignment. Accordingly,
we explained that if an entity seeks to assign or transfer control of a license to an entity that does not quality for
as favorable an installment payment plan, the installment payment plan, if any, for which the acquiring entity qualifies
will become effective immediately upon transfer or assignment of the license. Thus, a higher interest rate and earlier
payment of principal may begin to be applied.

120. Two petitioners discussed the holding period and limited transfer restrictions imposed on entrepreneurs'
block licenses. Specifically, AIDE requests the Commission repeal the five-year holding period, contending that
the unjust enrichment provisions (to the extent they promote recovery of bidding credits and installment payments)
eliminate the need for such a restriction. AIDE also argues that once a designated entity receives a spectrum-based
license, the mandate of Congress to provide these entities with a fair opportunity to provide spectrum-based services
is satisfied, and that there is no justification for any further restrictions beyond that point in time. AIDE also
wants clarification of how our unjust enrichment provisions will apply if a transfer or assignment does occur during
the five-year holding period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
121. Additionally, CTIA requests that the Commission amend its transfer restrictions to allow all PCS licensees
(including entrepreneurs' blocks and designated entities) to transfer 5 MHz of spectrum immediately after license
grant. Alternatively, CTIA asks that transfer be permitted within one year after service is initiated by a new PCS
entrant in the relevant PCS service area. CTIA contends that this change is needed to provide cellular carriers with
reasonable flexibility to reach the 40 MHz PCS spectrum cap (especially in secondary market transactions), and may
increase the value of spectrum at auction (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, by providing designated entities with an added source of funding and ensuring that market forces place the spectrum
in the hands of those who value it most highly).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
122. We will not modify our five-year holding period and limit transfer restrictions. While AIDE and CTIA ask us to
eliminate or significantly relax our restrictions, many commenters generally support the idea of a holding and limited
transfer period for entrepreneurs' block licenses. BET, for example, contends that without a holding requirement,
the opportunities for circumventing the Commission's rules are increased as non-designated entities weigh the
benefits of sacrificing certain preferences (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, bidding credits) in exchange for control of a valuable PCS license. Contrary to AIDE's point of view, we believe that
unjust enrichment provisions alone do not provide adequate safeguards for ensuring that designated entities retain

control over their licenses. We are satisfied that the five-year holding period and limited transfer restrictions

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

123. Additionally we reject CTIA's request to permit 5 MHz of spectrum to be transferred after the license grant because
it would contradict our determinations in the PCS service rules docket (Gen. Docket 90&hyph;314) concerning the
disaggregation of broadband PCS spectrum. In that docket, we decided that no disaggregation of spectrum should be
allowed until a broadband PCS licensee had met our five-year construction requirements.
<FOOTCITE>67</FOOTCITE>
 We also determined that in-region cellular interests should not be permitted to acquire 10 MHz of broadband PCS spectrum
until the year 2000_when they would be eligible for an additional 5 MHz of spectrum in their service areas.

124. In addition, we wish to clarify the application of our holding rule to our financial caps. As we have stated, under
certain circumstances we will allow licensees to retain their eligibility during the holding period, even if the
company has grown beyond our size limitations for the entrepreneurs' block and for small business eligibility. Thus,
we will permit entrepreneurs' block licensees to transfer their licenses in years four through five to other entrepreneurs'
block licensees even if it would result in growth beyond the permissible gross assets and total revenues caps, as long
as it otherwise complies with our control group and equity requirements. We believe this encourages designated entities
to grow, instead of penalizing them for their success, which was a concern expressed by some commenters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
125. Further, we clarify that between years four and five we will allow licensees to transfer a license to any entity
that either holds other entrepreneurs' block licenses (and thus at the time of auction satisfied the entrepreneurs'
block criteria) or that satisfies the criteria at the time of transfer. Unjust enrichment penalties apply if these
requirements are not met, or if they qualified for different provisions at the time of licensing. For purposes of determining
size eligibility for transfers or assignments that occur between the fourth and fifth years, we will use the most recently
available audited financial statements in cases where the entity to whom the license is being transferred did not
win a license in the original entrepreneurs' block auction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
126. AIDE sought clarification concerning the application of our unjust enrichment provisions to our holding period
and limited transfer rules. In response to their request, we reiterate that if a designated entity transfers or assigns
its license before year five to a company that qualifies for no bidding credit, then such a sale will entail full payment
of the bidding credit as a condition of transfer. If, however, the same transaction occurs (during the same time frame),
but the buyer is eligible for a lesser bidding credit, then the difference between the bidding credit obtained by the
seller and the bidding credit for which the buyer would qualify, must be paid to the U.S. Treasury for the transaction
to be approved by the FCC. With respect to installment payments, we confirm that we expect that when the purchaser is
not to an entity that qualifies for any installment payment plan, we will require payment of the unpaid balance in full
before the sale will be approved.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
was generic and that the Commission does not intend to limit itself to conducting ``random'' audits. While random
selection for audit may be one, acceptable enforcement technique in some cases, it may not be the most efficient. We
expect that audits might also be undertaken on information received from third parties or on the basis of other factors.
<FOOTCITE>68</FOOTCITE>
 Since the audit process will involve the application of in-house and contract resources, we intend to pursue a course
of audits that will be efficient as well as effective. Consequently, we are amending the rules to more fully reflect
the variety of circumstances that might lead to an audit. We will also add an audit consent to the FCC short-form and
other forms where eligibility must be established. Because the Commission's audit program will cover all auction
applications, regardless of the service involved, we will promulgate conforming amendments to Subpart Q in Part
1 of the Commission's regulations in a separate order.

While we anticipate that public scrutiny of entrepreneurs' block applications and the petition to deny process,

against those who abuse our processes. We also emphasize that the initiation of an investigation by the Commission

of a licensee's facilities pending the outcome of such investigation.

the measures to assist designated entities adopted pursuant to Section 309(j) of the Communications Act. To facilitate
our audit program and to provide preliminary assurances that those applicants claiming eligibility for such preferences
are in compliance with the regulatory requirements concerning ownership and financial status, we will require that
applicants list their control group members, affiliates, attributable investors, gross revenues, total assets
and other basic ownership and eligibility information in an exhibit to their short-form applications. Additional,
more detailed information concerning eligibility will be required of winning bidders. All applicants are required
to maintain an updated file of documentary evidence supporting the information and the status claimed. Applicants
that do not win the licenses for which they applied, shall maintain such records until final grant of the license(s)
in question, or one year from the date of the filing of their short-form applications, whichever is earlier. Licensees
shall maintain such records for the term of the license.

measures, we may consider, for example, the licensee's payment history, including whether it has defaulted before
and how far into the license term the default occurs, the reasons for default, whether the licensee has met construction
build-out requirements, the licensee's financial condition, and whether the licensee is seeking a buyer under a
distress sale policy. Following a grace period without successful resumption of payment or upon denial of a grace
period request, we will declare the license cancelled and take appropriate measures under the Commission's debt
collection rules and procedures.

131. Since several commenters requested clarification as to what the Commission would allow in the event a licensee
defaults on payment of its installment monies, we clarify that lenders and entrepreneurs' block licensees are free
to agree contractually to their own terms regarding situations where the licensee has defaulted under the Commission's
installment payment program, and possibly other obligations. As long as there is no transfer of control, we would
not become involved in the particulars of a voluntary workout arrangement between a designated entity and a third-party
lender.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
132. Specifically, an entrepreneurs' block licensee and its lenders may agree that, in the event the licensee defaults
on its installment payments, the lenders to that licensee will cure this default by assuming the designated entity's
payments to the government. Barring any transfer of control, we would not object to such an arrangement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
133. In the event a transfer of control is sought under the terms of the workout, the licensee and its lenders must apply
for Commission approval of the transfer, in accordance with Section 310(d) of the Communications Act. In a situation
where the lender itself is the proposed buyer or transferee, we would scrutinize such an application to determine
whether, by virtue of the loan agreement, an earlier transfer of control was effectuated. We clarify that we would
also expect that any requirements that arise by virtue of a licensee's status as an entrepreneur or as a designated
entity would be satisfied with respect to such a sale. Thus, for example, the transfer would need to be to another qualified
entrepreneur if it is to occur within our five-year holding period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
134. In the event an entrepreneurs' block licensee becomes subject to bankruptcy, our existing rules and precedent
clarify how the Commission would dispose of a license in such a circumstance. Specifically, transfer to a bankruptcy
trustee is viewed as an involuntary transfer or assignment to another party under Section 24.839 of the Commission's
Rules.
<FOOTCITE>71</FOOTCITE>
 In such a case therefore, there would be a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro forma
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 involuntary assignment of the license to a court-appointed trustee in bankruptcy, or to the licensee, as a debtor-in-possession.
Assuming the bankrupt estate is liquidated or the trustee finds a qualified purchaser for the licensee's system,
and assuming payments to the Commission are maintained or a grace period granted, we will continue generally to defer
to federal bankruptcy laws on many matters.
<FOOTCITE>72</FOOTCITE>
 We would, however, ultimately have to approve any final transfer of the license. As stated above, we would expect that
any requirements that arise by virtue of a licensee's status as an entrepreneur or as a designated entity would be satisfied
with respect to such a sale. Thus, for example, the transfer would need to be to another qualified entrepreneur if it
is to occur within our five-year holding period.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Basis for Affiliation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An individual or entity is an 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
affiliate 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
of an applicant or of a person holding an attributable interest in an applicant (both referred to herein as ``the applicant'')
if such individual or entity:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Directly or indirectly controls or has the power to control the applicant, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Is directly or indirectly controlled by the applicant, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Is directly or indirectly controlled by a third party or parties that also controls or has the power to control
the applicant, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Has an ``identity of interest'' with the applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Nature of control in determining affiliation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Every business concern is considered to have one or more parties who directly or indirectly control or have the
power to control it. Control may be affirmative or negative and it is immaterial whether it is exercised so long as the
power to control exists.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example for paragraph (l)(2)(i). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
An applicant owning 50 percent of the voting stock of another concern would have negative power to control such concern
since such party can block any action of the other stockholders. Also, the bylaws of a corporation may permit a stockholder
with less than 50 percent of the voting to block any actions taken by the other stockholders in the other entity. Affiliation
exists when the applicant has the power to control a concern while at the same time another person, or persons, are in
control of the concern at the will of the party or parties with the power of control.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(ii) Control can arise through stock ownership; occupancy of director, officer or key employee positions; contractual
or other business relations; or combinations of these and other factors. A key employee is an employee who, because
of his/her position in the concern, has a critical influence in or substantive control over the operations or management
of the concern.

no effective control can be established.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In a corporation where the officers and directors own various size blocks of stock totaling 40 percent of the corporation's
voting stock, but no officer or director has a block sufficient to give him or her control or the power to control and
the remaining 60 percent is widely distributed with no individual stockholder having a stock interest greater than
10 percent, management has the power to control. If persons with such management control of the other entity are persons
with attributable interests in the applicant, the other entity will be deemed an affiliate of the applicant.

Identity of interest between and among persons. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Affiliation can arise between or among two or more persons with an identity of interest, such as members of the same
family or persons with common investments. In determining if the applicant controls or is controlled by a concern,
persons with an identity of interest will be treated as though they were one person.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Two shareholders in Corporation Y each have attributable interests in the same PCS application. While neither shareholder
has enough shares to individually control Corporation Y, together they have the power to control Corporation Y. The
two shareholders with these common investments (or identity in interest) are treated as though they are one person
and Corporation Y would be deemed an affiliate of the applicant.

Kinship Affiliation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Immediate family members will be presumed to own or control or have the power to control interests owned or controlled
by other immediate family members. In this context ``immediate family member'' means father, mother, husband, wife,
son, daughter, brother, sister, father- or mother-in-law, son- or daughter-in-law, brother- or sister-in-law,
step-father, or -mother, step-brother, or -sister, step-son, or -daughter, half brother or sister. This presumption
may be rebutted by showing that
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The family members are estranged,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The family ties are remote, or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

A owns a controlling interest in Corporation X. A's sister-in-law, B, has an attributable interest in a PCS application.
Because A and B have a presumptive kinship affiliation, A's interest in Corporation X is attributable to B, and thus
to the applicant, unless B rebuts the presumption with the necessary showing.

Affiliation through stock ownership.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) An applicant is presumed to control or have the power to control a concern if he or she owns or controls or has the power
to control 50 percent or more of its voting stock.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) An applicant is presumed to control or have the power to control a concern even though he or she owns, controls or
has the power to control less than 50 percent of the concern's voting stock, if the block of stock he or she owns, controls
or has the power to control is large as compared with any other outstanding block of stock.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If two or more persons each owns, controls or has the power to control less than 50 percent of the voting stock of
a concern, such minority holdings are equal or approximately equal in size, and the aggregate of these minority holdings
is large as compared with any other stock holding, the presumption arises that each one of these persons individually
controls or has the power to control the concern; however, such presumption may be rebutted by a showing that such control
or power to control, in fact, does not exist.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Affiliation arising under stock options, convertible debentures, and agreements to merge. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Stock options, convertible debentures, and agreements to merge (including agreements in principle) are generally
considered to have a present effect on the power to control the concern. Therefore, in making a size determination,
such options, debentures, and agreements will generally be treated as though the rights held thereunder had been
exercised. However, neither an affiliate nor an applicant can use such options and debentures to appear to terminate
its control over another concern before it actually does so.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
If company B holds an option to purchase a controlling interest in company A, who holds an attributable interest in
a PCS application, the situation is treated as though company B had exercised its rights and had become owner of a controlling
interest in company A. The gross revenues of company B must be taken into account in determining the size of the applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 2 for paragraph (l)(5). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
If a large company, BigCo, holds 70% (70 of 100 outstanding shares) of the voting stock of company A, who holds an attributable
interest in a PCS application, and gives a third party, SmallCo, an option to purchase 50 of the 70 shares owned by BigCo,
BigCo will be deemed to be an affiliate of company A, and thus the applicant, until SmallCo actually exercises its options
to purchase such shares. In order to prevent BigCo from circumventing the intent of the rule which requires such options
to be considered on a fully diluted basis, the option is not considered to have present effect in this case.

will or to replace the trustee at will.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If a trustee has a familial, personal or extra-trust business relationship to the grantor or the beneficiary,
the stock interests held in trust will be deemed controlled by the grantor or beneficiary, as appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If the primary purpose of a voting trust, or similar agreement, is to separate voting power from beneficial ownership
of voting stock for the purpose of shifting control of or the power to control a concern in order that such concern or
another concern may meet the Commission's size standards, such voting trust shall not be considered valid for this
purpose regardless of whether it is or is not recognized within the appropriate jurisdiction.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Affiliation under joint venture arrangements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(i) A joint venture for size determination purposes is an association of concerns and/or individuals, with interests
in any degree or proportion, formed by contract, express or implied, to engage in and carry out a single, specific business
venture for joint profit for which purpose they combine their efforts, property, money, skill and knowledge, but
not on a continuing or permanent basis for conducting business generally. The determination whether an entity is
a joint venture is based upon the facts of the business operation, regardless of how the business operation may be designated
by the parties involved. An agreement to share profits/losses proportionate to each party's contribution to the
business operation is a significant factor in determining whether the business operation is a joint venture.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
