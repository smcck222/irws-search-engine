SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is amending its regulations to reflect the completion of the NRC Headquarters
consolidation effort, the merger of the Office of Administration and the Office of Consolidation, the reconstitution
of the Office of the Licensing Support System Administrator as an organizational unit of the Office of Information
Resources Management, and the transfer of the responsibility for administering the Licensing Support System from
the Commission staff to the Office of the Executive Director for Operations (EDO). These amendments also reflect
the change in the name of the Office of Small Business and Civil Rights, the deletion of the Uranium Recovery Field Office,
and the change of the Region V office to a Region IV field office. This final rule corrects several minor typographical
errors. The amendments are necessary to inform the public of these administrative changes to the NRC's regulations.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When the NRC began to consolidate its Headquarters offices, the NRC published a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice on December 29, 1987 (52 FR 49100), that announced the relocation of several of its Headquarters offices to
One White Flint North, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland. On January 1, 1988 (53 FR 1744), the NRC amended
its regulations to codify the relocation of those offices. The NRC has completed its consolidation effort by relocating
its remaining Headquarters offices to the agency's new office building located at Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville
Pike, Rockville, Maryland. This final rule is necessary to codify these consolidation changes. This final rule also
reflects the merger of the NRC's Office of Administration and the Office of Consolidation and the reconstitution
of the Office of the Licensing Support System Administrator (LSSA) as an organizational unit within the Office of
Information Resources Management (IRM). IRM reports to the EDO.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule also notifies the public of the name change of the Office of Small Business and Civil Rights, the deletion
of the Uranium Recovery Field Office, and the change of the Region V office to a Region IV field office.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because these amendments deal with agency practice and procedures, the notice and comment provisions of the Administrative
Procedure Act do not apply pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A). The amendments are effective upon publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Good cause exists to dispense with the usual 30-day delay in the effective date because these amendments are of a minor
and administrative nature, dealing with the agency's reorganization.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC has determined that this final rule is the type of action described in categorical exclusion 10 CFR 51.22(c)(2).
Therefore, neither an environmental impact statement nor an environmental assessment has been prepared for this
final rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Freedom of Information Reform Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99&hyph;570, 100 Stat. 3207&hyph;49, requires that each
agency promulgate regulations to establish procedures and guidelines to process requests received under FOIA.
This final rule amends DOE's FOIA regulation and supersedes DOE Order 1700.1 to state the DOE policy on access to contractor
records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under existing law, information becomes part of the agency's records only when the Government either created or obtained
the information and has control over the information at the time of a FOIA request. See, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Department of Justice v. Tax Analysts, 492 U.S. 136, 142&hyph;145 (1989). The Supreme Court has reasoned that FOIA
imposes no obligations on agencies to create or retain records and that use of federal funds and the Government's potential
access to records do not necessarily transform records into ``agency records'' subject to FOIA, unless the agency
in fact obtains the records.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nonetheless, as reflected in DOE Order 1700.1, DOE's past policy, however, has been to disclose information owned
by DOE, whether or not the Government has actual possession of the information at the time of the request. Under DOE
Order 1700.1, moreover, records not owned by DOE pursuant to a contract are disclosed under FOIA only if the DOE has
possession of them.

Department of Energy,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 No. CV 90&hyph;3568&hyph;ER (C.D. Cal. Oct 15, 1991), held that the DOE's policy on contractor records constitutes
a substantive rule under the Administrative Procedure Act, and, therefore, DOE's treatment of contractor records
should be promulgated through formal notice and comment rulemaking. Thus, this final rule supersedes DOE Order 1700.1
and establishes DOE's policy to provide for more public access to information than is mandated by existing law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 23, 1991, DOE published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (56 FR 55036), a proposal to amend the regulations that included a statement of the DOE policy on contractor records.
The proposed policy provided that, with certain exceptions, contractor records that were the property of the Government
were subject to disclosure under FOIA, whether or not DOE had possession of the documents at the time of a request. Forty-three
comments were received by the agency on the proposed policy. The comments criticizing the proposed policy on contractor
records broke into the two groups. One group of commentors took exception to the proposed DOE contractor records policy
because it extended the scope of documents available under FOIA beyond that which is required by existing case law
to include records not in the possession of DOE. These commentors stated that, regardless of ownership, DOE should
apply FOIA only to records in the possession of DOE in order to protect the confidentiality of certain information.
The second group of commentors opined that since government funds are expended to create contractor records, all
such records should be made available to the public under FOIA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE has reviewed all the comments and has determined to adopt the contractor records policy proposed in October 1991
as modified below as a final rule. Although DOE appreciates the views of both groups of commentors regarding access
to contractor records, the contractor records policy adopted by DOE promotes openness in government and continues
to provide the public access to DOE contractor records. Some members of the public commented that the proposed rule
would subject the public's right of access to contractor records to the vicissitudes of DOE's policies regarding
contractual provisions on ownership of records. However, DOE's management and operating contracts provide that
most records acquired or generated by the contractor in its performance of the contract are the property of the government.
Additionally, the government has a general right to inspect, copy, and audit records acquired or generated by the
contractor in connection with contract performance, including those records not owned by the government. The new
rule makes clear that even were a requested record not owned under the contract by the government, DOE can exercise
its contractual rights to acquire possession of the record if necessary to maximize public disclosure of records
concerning health, safety, and the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new policy also recognizes the necessity to maintain the confidentiality of certain privileged and commercially
sensitive information to protect legitimate contractor interests and the integrity of the Government's operations.
The contractor records policy adopted today is not intended to affect any records management responsibilities of
a DOE contractor under the Records Disposal Act, 44 U.S.C. &sect;3301.

It has been determined that this action is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the Executive Order 12866,
``Regulatory Planning and Review,'' (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993). Accordingly, this action was not subject to review
under that executive order by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of the Office of Management and Budget.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12612 requires that regulations or rules be reviewed for direct effects on States, on the relationship
between the national government and the States, or in the distribution of power among various levels of government.
If there are sufficient substantial direct effects, then Executive Order 12612 requires preparation of a federalism
assessment to be used in all decisions involved in promulgating or implementing a regulation or rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's regulatory action does not affect any traditional State function. There are therefore no substantial effects
requiring evaluation or assessment under Executive Order 12612.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., which requires preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis for any regulations that will have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. DOE finds that sections 603 and 604 of that Act do not apply
to this rule because it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Thus
the preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis is not warranted.

There is no impact on the human environment under the regulatory amendments being issued today. Accordingly, DOE
has determined that this is not a major Federal action on which significant impact upon the quality of the human environment
and, therefore, preparation of an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement is not required
and categorically excluded from preparation under the National Environmental Policy Act pursuant to Appendix A6
of 10 CFR Part 1021.

Section 2 of Executive Order 12778 instructs each agency to adhere to certain requirements in promulgating new regulations
and reviewing existing regulations. These requirements, set forth in sections 2(a) and (b)(2), include eliminating
drafting errors and needless ambiguity, drafting the regulations to minimize litigation, providing clear and certain
legal standards for affected conduct, and promoting simplification and burden reductions. Agencies are also instructed
to make every effort to ensure that the regulation specifies clearly a preemptive effect, effect on existing Federal
law or regulation, and retroactive effect; describes any administrative proceedings; and defines key terms. The
DOE certifies that today's final rule meets the requirements of sections 2(a) and (b)(2) of Executive Order 12778.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This action establishes Class E airspace at Wilmington, Airborne Airpark, OH. Presently, this area is designated
as Class D airspace when the associated control tower is in operation. However, controlled airspace to the surface
is needed when the control tower located at this area is closed. The intended effect of this action is to provide adequate
Class E airspace for instrument flight rule (IFR) operations when the control tower is closed.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Although this action is in the form of a final rule, and was not preceded by notice and public procedure, comments are
invited on the rule. When the comment period ends, the FAA will use the comments submitted, together with other available
information, to review the regulation. If the FAA receives no adverse comments in response to this action, this rule
will become effective on the date specified in the ``DATES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' section. After the review, if the FAA finds that further changes are appropriate, it will initiate rulemaking proceedings
to amend the regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments that provide the factual basis supporting the views and suggestions presented are particularly helpful
in evaluating the effects of the rule, and in determining whether additional rulemaking is required. Comments are
specifically invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, environmental, and energy-related aspects
of the rule which might suggest the need to modify the rule.

The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 71 of the Feral Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) establishes Class E airspace at Wilmington,
Airborne Airpark, OH. Currently, this airspace is designated as Class D when the associated control tower is in operation.
Nevertheless, controlled airspace to the surface is needed for IFR operations at Airborne Airpark when the control
tower is closed. The intended effect of this action is to provide adequate Class E airspace for IFR operations at the
airport when the control tower is closed. As noted in the Airspace Reclassification Final Rule, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 17, 1991, airspace at an airport with a part-time control tower should be designated as a Class D airspace
area when the control tower is in operation, and as a Class E airspace area when the control tower is closed (56 FR 65645).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations are published
in Paragraph 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated
by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently
in the Order. Under the circumstances presented, the FAA concludes that there is an immediate need to establish this
Class E airspace area in order to promote the safe and efficient handling of air traffic in these areas. Therefore,
I find that notice and public procedures under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and contrary to the public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

 This action modifies Restricted Area R&hyph;5111C, Elephant Butte, NM, by vertically subdividing the area into
two separate areas designated as R&hyph;5111C and R&hyph;5111D. The present vertical dimension of R&hyph;5111C
is from the surface to unlimited. This action will amend R&hyph;5111C to 13,000 feet mean sea level (MSL) to unlimited
and establish R&hyph;5111D from the surface to but not including 13,000 feet MSL. The lateral dimensions will remain
the same. Stratification of the present R&hyph;5111C will enable the military to activate only that portion of the
airspace that is actually needed to contain their operations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations modifies Restricted Area R&hyph;5111C, Elephant Butte,
NM, by vertically subdividing the area into two separate areas designated as R&hyph;5111C and R&hyph;5111D. This
action does not change the activities conducted in the area. This action will create an effective management tool
for the military by allowing it to activate only that portion of the special use airspace that it needs to contain hazardous
activities. This action does not alter the boundaries of restricted airspace, nor is the mission conducted within
the airspace changed, therefore, I find that notice and public procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are unnecessary because
this action is a minor technical amendment in which the public is not particularly interested. The coordinates for
this docket are based on North American Datum 83. Section 73.51 of part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations was republished
in FAA Order 7400.8B dated March 9, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) for
operations at certain airports. These regulatory actions are needed because of changes occurring in the National
Airspace System, such as the commissioning of new navigational facilities, addition of new obstacles, or changes
in air traffic requirements. These changes are designed to provide safe and efficient use of the navigable airspace
and to promote safe flight operations under instrument flight rules at the affected airports.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs). The complete regulatory description on each SIAP is contained
in the appropriate FAA Form 8260 and the National Flight Data Center (FDC)/Permanent (P) Notices to Airmen (NOTAM)
which are incorporated by reference in the amendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part 51, and &sect;97.20 of the Federal
Aviation Regulations (FAR). Materials incorporated by reference are available for examination or purchase as stated
above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The large number of SIAPs, their complex nature, and the need for a special format make their verbatim publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 expensive and impractical. Further, airmen do not use the regulatory text of the SIAPs, but refer to their graphic
depiction of charts printed by publishers of aeronautical materials. Thus, the advantages of incorporation by reference
are realized and publication of the complete description of each SIAP contained in FAA form documents is unnecessary.
The Provisions of this amendment state the affected CFR (and FAR) sections, with the types and effective dates of the
SIAPs. This amendment also identifies the airport, its location, the procedure identification and the amendment
number.

The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
SIAPs. For safety and timeliness of change considerations, this amendment incorporates only specific changes contained
in the content of the following FDC/P NOTAM for each SIAP. The SIAP information in some previously designated FDC/Temporary
(FDC/T) NOTAMs is of such duration as to be permanent. With conversion to FDC/P NOTAMs, the respective FDC/T NOTAMs
have been cancelled.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FDC/P NOTAMs for the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the U.S. Standard
for Terminal Instrument Approach Procedures (TERPS). In developing these chart changes to SIAPs by FDC/P NOTAMs,
the TERPS criteria were applied to only these specific conditions existing at the affected airports. All SIAP amendments
in this rule have been previously issued by the FAA in a National Flight Data Center (FDC) Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) as
an emergency action of immediate flight safety relating directly to published aeronautical charts. The circumstances
which created the need for all these SIAP amendments requires making them effective in less than 30 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the TERPS. Because of the close
and immediate relationship between these SIAPs and safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedure
before adopting these SIAPs are unnecessary, impracticable, and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable,
that good cause exists for making these SIAPs effective in less than 30 days.

Conclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA certifies that this amendment will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) for
operations at certain airports. These regulatory actions are needed because of the adoption of new or revised criteria,
or because of changes occurring in the National Airspace System, such as the commissioning of new navigational facilities,
addition of new obstacles, or changes in air traffic requirements. These changes are designed to provide safe and
efficient use of the navigable airspace and to promote safe fight operations under instrument flight rules at the
affected airports.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs). The complete regulatory description of each SIAP is contained
in official FAA form documents which are incorporated by reference in this amendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part
51, and &sect;97.20 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR). The applicable FAA Forms are identified as FAA Forms
8260&hyph;3, 8260&hyph;4, and 8260&hyph;5. Materials incorporated by reference are available for examination
or purchase as stated above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The large number of SIAPs, their complex nature, and the need for a special format make their verbatim publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 expensive and impractical. Further, airmen do not use the regulatory text of the SIAPs, but refer to their graphic
depiction on charts printed by publishers of aeronautical materials. Thus, the advantages of incorporation by reference
are realized and publication of the complete description of each SIAP contained in FAA form documents is unnecessary.
The provisions of this amendment state the affected CFR (and FAR) sections, with the types and effective dates of the
SIAPs. This amendment also identifies the airport, its location, the procedure identification and the amendment
number.

The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 97 is effective upon publication of each separate SIAP as contained in the transmittal. Some
SIAP amendments may have been previously issued by the FAA in a National Flight Data Center (FDC) Notice to Airmen (NOTAM)
as an emergency action of immediate flight safety relating directly to published aeronautical charts. The circumstances
which created the need for some SIAP amendments may require making them effective in less than 30 days. For the remaining
SIAPs, an effective date at least 30 days after publication is provided.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the U.S. Standard for Terminal
Instrument Approach Procedures (TERPS). In developing these SIAPs, the TERPS criteria were applied to the conditions
existing or anticipated at the affected airports. Because of the close and immediate relationship between these
SIAPs and safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedure before adopting these SIAPs are unnecessary,
impracticable, and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable, that good cause exists for making some
SIAPs effective in less than 30 days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA certifies that this amendment will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

This amendment establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) for
operations at certain airports. These regulatory actions are needed because of the adoption of new or revised criteria,
or because of changes occurring in the National Airspace System, such as the commissioning of new navigational facilities,
addition of new obstacles, or changes in air traffic requirements. These changes are designed to provide safe and
efficient use of the navigable airspace and to promote safe flight operations under instrument flight rules at the
affect airports.

This amendment to part 97 is effective upon publication of each separate SIAP as contained in the transmittal. The
SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the United States Standard for Terminal Instrument

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined through testing that current non-localizer type, non-precision instrument approaches developed
using the TERPS criteria can be flown by aircraft equipped with Global Positioning System (GPS) equipment. In consideration
of the above, the applicable Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) will be altered to include ``or GPS''
in the title without otherwise reviewing or modifying the procedure. Because of the close and immediate relationship
between these SIAPs and safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedure before adopting these SIAPs
are unnecessary, impracticable, and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable, that good cause exists
for making some SIAPs effective in less than 30 days.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In a notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 4, 1988 (53 FR 44670), corrected on December 23, 1988 (53 FR 51950), FDA announced that a food additive petition
(FAP 7B4017) had been filed by Nippon Gohsei (U.S.A.) Co., Ltd., 747 Third Ave., New York, NY 10017. The petition proposed
that the food additive regulations in &sect;175.300 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Resinous and polymeric coatings
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (21 CFR 175.300) be amended to provide for the safe use of a polyester resin prepared from terephthalic acid, isophthalic
acid, succinic anhydride, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, and 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-propanediol as a component
of polymeric coatings intended to contact alcoholic foods.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Upon further review of the petition, the agency noted that the petitioner had also requested use of the additive in
contact with aqueous foods in addition to its use in contact with alcoholic foods. In a notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of June 15, 1994 (59 FR 30803), FDA amended the November 4, 1988, notice to state that the petitioner had requested that
the food additive regulations be amended to provide for the safe use of the additive in contact with aqueous and alcoholic
foods.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has evaluated data in the petition and other relevant material. The agency concludes that the proposed use of the
additive is safe and that &sect;175.300(b)(3) should be amended as set forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with &sect;171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied
upon in reaching its decision to approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and
Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h),
the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure before making
the documents available for inspection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person who will be adversely affected by this regulation may at any time on or before January 11, 1995, file with
the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written objections thereto. Each objection shall be separately numbered,
and each numbered objection shall specify with particularity the provisions of the regulation to which objection
is made and the grounds for the objection. Each numbered objection on which a hearing is requested shall specifically
so state. Failure to request a hearing for any particular objection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing
on that objection. Each numbered objection for which a hearing is requested shall include a detailed description
and analysis of the specific factual information intended to be presented in support of the objection in the event
that a hearing is held. Failure to include such a description and analysis for any particular objection shall constitute
a waiver of the right to a hearing on the objection. Three copies of all documents shall be submitted and shall be identified
with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Any objections received in response to the
regulation may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of January 7, 1983 (48 FR 834), FDA published a proposal to affirm that citric acid, dibasic ammonium citrate, calcium
citrate, potassium citrate, sodium citrate, isopropyl citrate, stearyl citrate, and triethyl citrate are GRAS
for use as direct human food ingredients. The proposal was published in accordance with the announced FDA review of
the safety of GRAS and prior-sanctioned food ingredients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with &sect;170.35 (21 CFR 170.35), copies of the scientific literature review and the report of the
Select Committee on GRAS Substances (the Select Committee) on citric acid and these citrate derivatives have been
made available for public review in the Dockets Management Branch (address above). Copies of these documents are
also available for purchase from the National Technical Information Service, U.S. Department of Commerce, 5285
Port Royal Rd., Springfield, VA 22161.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal gave interested parties an opportunity to submit comments. Several letters, each containing one or
more comments, were received in response to the proposal. The substantive comments received addressed several points,
among which were additional uses for certain citrates, changes in the description of the manufacturing methods for
other specific citrates, and other technical corrections to the regulations proposed for other specific citrates.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of August 20, 1992 (57 FR 37738), FDA published a tentative final rule announcing that it was tentatively affirming
the GRAS status of citric acid and the citrate derivatives named above. In the tentative final rule, the agency responded
to the comments that had been received in response to the proposal. The agency published a tentative final rule before
proceeding to final action because a significant period of time had elapsed since publication of the proposal. In
addition, the agency wished to allow for comment on two provisions in the tentative final rule that were not part of
the original proposal: (1) The inclusion of the changes published in the third supplement to the Food Chemicals Codex,
3d ed., in the specifications for citric acid in new &sect;184.1033(b); and (2) the revised description of isopropyl
citrate in new &sect;184.1386(a) and of stearyl citrate in new &sect;184.1851(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Response to Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three comments were received in response to the agency's tentative final rule on citric acid and the citrates named
above. None of the comments addressed the provisions in the tentative final rule on which the agency had requested
comments. Two of the comments merely expressed general support for the agency's tentative affirmation of the GRAS
status of citric acid and the above named citrates. One comment reported additional direct food uses for calcium citrate
and requested inclusion of these uses in the final rule. The additional uses, for which the comment provided information
on dietary exposure, were in home-prepared jams and jellies, and in beverages and beverage bases; the technical effects
specified were as an anti-caking and free-flow agent, or as a processing aid. The comment also indicated that calcium
citrate is used as a pH control agent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its safety review, the Select Committee had concluded that no evidence in the available information on calcium
citrate demonstrates, or suggests reasonable grounds to suspect, a hazard to the public at levels that are now current
or might reasonably be expected in the future. In the proposal, the agency stated that it had undertaken its own review
of the available information on calcium citrate and concurred in the conclusion of the Select Committee (48 FR 834
at 836). The agency has considered the requested additional uses of this ingredient and finds that the additional
amounts consumed would not be large enough to change that conclusion and that sufficient safety data exist to affirm
the uses as GRAS when the ingredient is used in accordance with current good manufacturing practice. The agency also
concludes that the ingredient will perform the technical effects specified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency concludes that a large margin of safety exists for current and reasonably expected future uses of calcium
citrate in food. In light of this large margin of safety, the agency finds that inclusion of all of the food categories
and technical effects in which calcium citrate is used, or in which its use was requested, would result in a regulation
for calcium citrate that would be unnecessarily long. Therefore, the agency is no longer including a list of technical
effects nor a list of food categories in new &sect;184.1195(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Scope of the Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is amending the current regulations by removing 21 CFR 182.1033, 182.1195, 182.1625, 182.1751, 182.1911, 182.6033,
182.6195, 182.6386, 182.6511, 182.6625, 182.6751, 182.6851, and 182.8195. The agency is adding new 21 CFR 184.1033,
184.1140, 184.1195, 184.1386, 184.1625, 184.1751, 184.1851, and 184.1911.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Environmental Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has previously considered the environmental effects of this rule as announced in the proposed rule that
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of January 7, 1983 (48 FR 834). No new information or comments have been received that would affect the agency's previous
determination that there is no significant impact on the human environment and that an environmental impact statement
is not required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Economic Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has examined the economic implications of this rule, which affirms that citric acid, dibasic ammonium citrate,
calcium citrate, potassium citrate, sodium citrate, isopropyl citrate, stearyl citrate, and triethyl citrate
are GRAS for use as direct human food ingredients, under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act
(Pub. L. 96&hyph;354). Executive Order 12866 directs Federal agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available
regulatory alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits
(including potential economic and environmental benefits, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts
and equity). The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires analyzing options for regulatory relief for small businesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency finds that this rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined by Executive Order 12866. Because
no current activity is prohibited by this rule, the compliance cost to firms is zero. Because no increase in the health
risks faced by consumers will result from this final rule, total costs are also zero. Potential benefits include the
possible wider use of these substances to achieve intended technical effects and any resources saved by reducing
the need to prepare further petitions to affirm the GRAS status of certain of these substances. In accordance with
the Regulatory Flexibility Act, FDA has also determined that this rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small businesses.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard is changing the regulation governing the operation of the S36 Bridge over the St. Croix River at mile
23.4, at Stillwater, Minnesota. The existing regulation was temporarily amended for the 1994 St. Croix River boating
season because the previous opening schedule was contributing to traffic delays and congestion in Stillwater. This
revised opening schedule was evaluated through the 1994 St. Croix River boating season. As a result of traffic studies
and evaluations, a new opening schedule is being implemented to reduce traffic delays and congestion.

Regulatory History
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On Friday, October 8, 1993, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled Drawbridge Operation
Regulations, St. Croix River, Minnesota and Wisconsin in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 52466). The Coast Guard received six comments on the proposal. A public meeting was requested and held on April
7, 1994, in the Stillwater Municipal Building. At that meeting the bridge owner, Minnesota Department of Transportation
(MNDOT), recommended a revised opening schedule based on traffic data and studies. The Coast Guard decided to issue
a temporary regulation which would allow evaluation of MNDOT's proposed changes during the summer boating season.
The temporary regulation was published as a Final Temporary Rule on Friday, June 3, 1994 in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 28776).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The St. Croix River is heavily used by recreational craft. River excursion boats are the only known commercial navigation
passing the bridge. To meet the navigational needs of these boaters the S36 Bridge is presently required to open on
signal from May 15 through October 15 on a set schedule of hourly and half hourly openings from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. From October
16 through May 14, the draw opens on signal if at least 24 hours notice is given.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In an effort to reduce traffic congestion on the approaches to the bridge, the Mayor of Stillwater requested that the
bridge's operating schedule be amended. The Coast Guard proposed a change which would permit hourly openings on weekdays
from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. and on Saturdays, Sundays and federal holidays from 8 a.m. to midnight. The two hours advance notice
from 10 p.m. to 8 a.m. weekdays, and from midnight to 8 a.m., Saturdays, Sundays and federal holidays would remain in
effect.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Discussion of Comments and Changes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard received six comments on the Proposed Rulemaking. Three supported the proposed change; a fourth,
from the Minnesota Historical Society, stated that the proposed action would have no effect on the historic characteristics
of the bridge, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Two comments, one from a local recreational
boater and the other from the owner of a local marina, objected to the proposed change. As a result of the objections,
the Coast Guard requested that MNDOT conduct traffic studies, evaluate the results and recommend an opening schedule
that would retain an acceptable number of bridge openings and provide for peak highway traffic. Based on the evaluation
of vehicle traffic counts and studies, MNDOT reported that no change was warranted by traffic conditions during weekday
morning hours. Because heavy vehicular traffic arrived between 3 p.m. and 7 p.m. on weekdays, MNDOT recommended that
the existing schedule be observed up to and including the 2:30 p.m. opening, and that openings after 2:30 p.m. should
occur at 4 p.m., 5:30 p.m., 6:30 p.m. and 7 p.m. with an opening every half hour thereafter until 10 p.m. Because heavy
vehicular traffic arrived between 9 a.m. and 8 p.m. on weekends and holidays, MNDOT recommended that the existing
schedule be retained, up to and including the 9 a.m. opening, and that the opening schedule be revised for one opening
per hour from 9 a.m. until 8 p.m. with half hourly openings from 8 p.m. until midnight.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard published a Final Temporary Rule promulgating the opening schedule recommended by MNDOT, and requested
comments throughout the evaluation period, which ended November 15, 1994. No comments have been received. Accordingly,
the Coast Guard is revising the existing regulation to promulgate the opening schedule in effect for the 1994 boating
season.

Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not under the regulatory policies and procedures of the
Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies
and procedures of DOT is unnecessary because operators of commercial vessels have indicated that they can adjust
to the changes without impact on their businesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Small Entities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After considering the comments submitted in response to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on Friday, October 8, 1993, (58 FR 52466), the Coast Guard finds that any impact on small entities, if any, is not substantial.
Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Collection of Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Federalism Assessment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard has analyzed this final rule under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612
and has determined that it does not raise sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism
Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Environmental Assessment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard has reviewed the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that under section 2.B.2 of the NEPA
Implementing Procedures, COMDTINST M16475.1B, this final rule is categorically excluded from further environmental
documentation because promulgation of changes to drawbridge regulations have been found to not have a significant
effect on the human environment. A Categorical Exclusion Determination is available in the docket.

Regulatory History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking was not published for this regulation and good cause exists
for making it effective in less than 30 days after 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 publication. Due to the date the application was received, there was not sufficient time to publish proposed rules
in advance of the event. If the event, which is centered around a national holiday, were required to be postponed by
publishing an NPRM, the event would be cancelled. Publishing an NPRM and delaying the event would be contrary to the
public interest since the fireworks display is to celebrate the New Year's national holiday.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Background and Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 31, 1994, the city of New Bedford is sponsoring a fireworks display in celebration of New Year's Eve. The
fireworks will be launched from a barge anchored in New Bedford Channel in the vicinity of New Bedford Channel Lighted
Bell Buoy 16 (LLNR 16895), beginning at 12 midnight December 31, 1994. This safety zone will be established within
a 350 yard radius around the fireworks barge. The fireworks display will last for approximately one half hour. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this rulemaking is to establish a safety zone to prohibit vessels from transiting or anchoring in the
area of New Bedford Harbor over which the fireworks will be launched, in order to protect these vessels and the persons
onboard from potential damage, fire, or personal injury due to sparks and falling debris. The safety zone will be in
effect between 11 p.m. on December 31, 1994, and 1 a.m. January 1, 1995, and will effectively close New Bedford Channel
in the vicinity of New Bedford Channel Lighted Bell Buoy 16 (LLRN 16895) to all vessel traffic during the period.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulatory Evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures
of DOT is unnecessary. The entities most likely to be effected are pleasure craft wishing to view the fireworks from
the water as well as fishing vessels and other commercial vessel traffic wishing to transit the area. Spectator vessels
will still be able to view the fireworks from the water but will be required to do so at a distance of more than 350 yards
from the barge, which will not cause them undue hardship. Fishing vessels will be prohibited from transiting through
the area while the zone is in effect. This will not have a significant economic impact on them because of the short duration
of the zone and extensive advisories which will be made. Most of the fishermen who work out of New Bedford are aware that
the fireworks and accompanying safety zone will be in place the evening of December 31, 1994. The commercial terminals
in the harbor have been notified and any scheduled traffic will be aware of the safety zone. Thus, this safety zone should
not cause undue hardship to any entity.

Small Entities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant
in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act
(15 U.S.C. 632).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons outlined in the Regulatory Evaluation above, the Coast Guard expects the impact to be minimal on all
entities. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605 (b) that this final rule will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

This rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard has analyzed this final rule in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive
Order 12612 and has determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the
preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this rule and has concluded that under Section 2.B.2.c.
of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, it is an action under the Coast Guard's statutory authority to protect public
safety, and thus is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A Categorical Exclusion
Determination will be made available in the docket.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
(59 FR 10104), a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to revise the regulations governing the program for Grants for
Faculty Training Projects in Geriatric Medicine and Dentistry, authorized under section 777(b) of the Public Health
Service Act (the Act) (42 U.S.C. 294o). The Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;408)
amended and renumbered former section 789(b) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 295g&hyph;9(b)) to section 777(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM proposed amendments to implement several statutory provisions by: (1) Adding a definition for the term ``Geriatric
psychiatry'' to implement the requirement for the expansion of project support to include the training of physicians
who plan to teach geriatric psychiatry, and by (2) adding a definition for the term ``Relevant advanced training or
experience'' to implement the requirement for dentists who are awarded a 2-year internal medicine or family medicine
fellowship. The NPRM also proposed to remove a section in the regulations regarding the period of time for appointment
to fellowships to allow for less restrictive requirements for those individuals who may benefit from further fellowship
or retraining experience in a lifetime.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public comment period on the proposed regulations closed on April 4, 1994. The Department received 4 public comments.
The comments received on the proposed rule to section 777(b) and the Department's responses to the comments are discussed
below according to the section numbers and headings of the regulation affected.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department proposed the following definition for the term ``Geriatric psychiatry'':
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Geriatric psychiatry
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' means the prevention, diagnosis, evaluation and treatment of mental disorders and disturbances seen in older
adults.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This definition was proposed to be added to the section to incorporate the statutory requirement for the expansion
of project support to include the training of physicians who plan to teach geriatric psychiatry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department received positive responses to this definition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department also proposed the following definition for the term ``Relevant advanced training or experience'':
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Relevant advanced training or experience
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' means at least one of the following: (1) Completion of at least a 12-month graduate training program in a health-related
discipline, the basic sciences, or education; or (2) a minimum of 2 years of clinical practice, of which at least 12
months were devoted in part to managing older dental patients in a hospital, long-term care facility, or other setting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This definition was proposed to be added to the section to incorporate the statutory requirement for the expansion
of fellowship eligibility of dental fellows in the program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One respondent found this definition ``extremely helpful in setting a high standard for the selection of highly motivated
and qualified candidates''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department also received a request that dentists who have had ``relevant teaching experience in an accredited
dental school'' be added to the definition. The Department accepts the general intent of this recommendation while
noting that ``relevant'' alone is not explicit and is open to interpretation. In response to this concern, the Department
has expanded the definition of ``Relevant advanced training or experience'' in the final regulations to include
an additional experience, ``a minimum of 2 years of teaching experience in an accredited dental educational program
of which at least 12 months were devoted in part to issues pertaining to the care of older adults.''

Section 57.4111 ``Duration of Fellowships''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department proposed to remove this section from the regulations to allow less restrictive requirements for those
individuals who may benefit from further fellowship or retraining experience in a lifetime. The section language
read:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
``An appointment to a fellowship may be made for a period not to exceed 12 months. Fellowship assistance for participants
in a 1-year fellowship program and a 1-year retraining program is limited to 12 months. Participants in 2-year fellowship
programs may receive a second 12-month appointment for a total period of 24 months.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department gave an example in the NPRM how this language might be restrictive to fellows: ``For example, a faculty
fellow who completed a 1-year retraining to have the skills required to incorporate geriatrics into course content
and clinical rotations may discover 5 years later that another fellowship experience would provide the opportunity
to develop research skills in geriatrics required to expand the scope and depth of practice-based geriatric research.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One respondent requested the ``removal of the 1-year fellowship [retraining] limit of Federal support for psychiatrists
who wish to train other psychiatrists in geriatric psychiatry''. The respondent stated that this is a reasonable
request as it would permit the training to fully meet the requirements of exposure to the physical and mental disabilities
of a diverse population of elderly individuals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has not accepted this recommendation because the statute requires that the 2-year fellowship program
be an internal medicine or family medicine fellowship program, not a psychiatry fellowship program. (See section
777(b)(3)(B) of the Act and &sect;57.4105(d) of the regulations.) However, psychiatrists are eligible to participate
as fellows in the 2-year programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the changes proposed above, a number of technical, clarifying, and ministerial changes were included
to conform the existing regulations with amendments made by Pub. L. 102&hyph;408. The Department also received a
few comments on some of these technical changes. The Department's responses are also discussed below. These changes
affecting the program for Faculty Training Projects in Geriatric Medicine and Dentistry are as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Revise the section number of the Act from ``789(b)'' to ``777(b)'' wherever it appears in subpart PP, as renumbered,
and the United States Code citation from ``(42 U.S.C. 295g&hyph;9(b))'' to ``(42 U.S.C. 294o)'', in accordance with
Pub. L. 102&hyph;408.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Revise &sect;57.4101, entitled ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
To what projects do these regulations apply?'', 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
by adding the words ``geriatric psychiatry'' to reflect statutory language which expands project support to include
the training of physicians who plan to teach geriatric psychiatry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Revise &sect;57.4102, entitled ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Definitions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'', to amend the following terms to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Remove the definition of ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Council
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' regarding the National Advisory Council on Health Professions Education, in accordance with Pub. L. 102&hyph;408.
The statute repealed the Council effective October 1, 1992;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Revise the phrase ``by an organized medical staff'' to ``by an organized health care staff'' at the end of the definition
of ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Extended care facility
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' to clarify that staff of health care institutions includes nurses, physical therapists, social workers and other
health care staff who provide ``medically-prescribed skilled nursing care or rehabilitative services''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department received one comment regarding the proposed clarifying change to the phrase ``organized health care
staff'' as having potential conflict with individual State laws or licensing authorities. It is the Department's
view that the clarifying phrase includes medical staff along with all other health care professionals and should
not be in conflict with any individual State laws or licensing authorities. Therefore, this amendment will remain
as proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Revise the introductory text to the definition of ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fellowship program
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' by removing the reference to a 1-year fellowship program which is no longer a statutory provision for project support;
and revise paragraph (2) of the definition to reflect new statutory requirements for the training of dentists who
have ``demonstrated a commitment to an academic career and who have completed postdoctoral dental training, including
postdoctoral dental education programs or who have relevant advanced training or experience''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department received favorable support for this change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Revise the section number of the Act in the definition of ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
School of medicine or school of osteopathic medicine

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' from ``701(5)'' to ``799(1)(E)'', in accordance with Pub. L. 102&hyph;408.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Amend &sect;57.4105, entitled ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Project requirements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'', to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Revise paragraph (d) regarding the requirement that projects be based in a graduate medical education program
by adding the words ``or psychiatry'' after the phrase ``or in a department of geriatrics'' to reflect statutory language
which expanded project support to include the training of physicians who plan to teach geriatric psychiatry. Paragraph
(d) is further revised by removing the phrase ``in existence as of December 1, 1987'' at the end of the sentence, in accordance
with Pub. L. 102&hyph;408;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Revise paragraph (e) regarding the requirement that projects be staffed by at least two physicians in full-time
teaching positions who have experience or training in geriatric medicine by adding the words ``or geriatric psychiatry'',
in accordance with Pub. L. 102&hyph;408; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Revise the introductory text to paragraph (f) regarding the requirement that the project must provide fellows
``with training in geriatrics and exposure to the physical and mental disabilities of'' a diverse population of elderly
individuals, to more appropriately reflect the language in Pub. L. 102&hyph;408.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Revise &sect;57.4106, entitled ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
How will applications be evaluated?
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'', by:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Removing the reference to the National Advisory Council on Health Professions Education, in accordance with Pub.
L. 102&hyph;408, in paragraph (a) introductory text and revising the introductory text to reflect current statutory
language regarding the evaluation and recommendation process of awarding grant applications; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Adding a comma and the words ``psychiatry, or'' after the words ``geriatric medicine'' in paragraph (a)(5) to reflect
statutory language which expanded training to include geriatric psychiatry.

'', as &sect;57.4114 and revise the section number ``705'' in the text to ``798(e)'', in accordance with Pub. L. 102&hyph;408.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is further revising &sect;57.4115 by removing the reference to ``section 705 of the PHS Act'' instead
of renumbering the section number to ``798(e)'' as proposed in the NPRM. The reference to section 705 concerning audit
and inspection requirements is redundant to the requirements that are already covered under 45 CFR part 74. We are
also removing the parenthetical phrase at the end of the section text citing the OMB approval number regarding information
collection requirements as no longer necessary.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, Public Law 103&hyph;227, enacted on March 11, 1994, prohibits smoking in certain facilities in which minors
will be present. The Department of Health and Human Services is now preparing to implement the provision of that law.
Until those implementation plans are in place, the PHS continues to strongly encourage all grant recipients to provide
a smoke-free workplace and promote the non-use of all tobacco products.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Economic Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12866 requires that all regulations reflect consideration of alternatives, of costs, of benefits,
of incentives, of equity, and of available information. Regulations must meet certain standards, such as avoiding
unnecessary burden. Regulations which are ``significant'' because of cost, adverse effects on the economy, inconsistency
with other agency actions, effects on the budget, or novel legal or policy issues, require special analysis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that the resources required to implement the requirements in these regulations are minimal.
Therefore, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, the Secretary certifies that these regulations
will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. For the same reasons, the Secretary has
also determined that this is not a ``significant'' rule under Executive Order 12866.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 28, 1994, 59 FR 38418 (``NPR'' or ``Proposed Rule''),
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 proposing to establish new filing fees. In the NPR, the Commission noted that the Independent Offices Appropriation
Act (``IOAA''), 31 U.S.C. 9701, permits it to establish fees for services and benefits that the Commission provides
to specific recipients. The primary guidance for implementation of IOAA is Office of Management and Budget (``OMB'')
Circular A&hyph;25, as revised July 8, 1993. OMB Circular A&hyph;25 requires that a reasonable charge be made to each
recipient for a measurable unit or amount of Federal Government service from which the recipient derives a benefit,
in order that the Government recover the full cost of rendering that service. OMB Circular A&hyph;25 further provides
that costs be determined or estimated from the best available records in the agency, and that cost computations shall
cover the direct and indirect costs to the Government of carrying out the activity.

The NPR advised that the Commission's existing filing and service fees do not include fees for certain services that
appear to provide special benefits to identifiable members of the public. The Commission, accordingly, proposed
to establish several new fees to reflect the full cost of services that provide special benefits to identifiable members
of the public.

Tariff and ET Filing Fees

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The bulk of the comments focuses on the new fees for tariff and ET filings. Those commenters opposed to the proposed
fees for tariff and ET filing primarily contend that the Commission should not require carriers to pay for filings
that are mandated by law; that facilitate the administering of FMC regulations; and that, they believe, benefit the
shipping public as a whole. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As regards the argument that tariff and ET filings are required by law, we would point out that the Federal Communication
Commission's (``FCC'') imposition of fees for processing carrier tariffs has been upheld,

, 777 F.2d 722, 730&hyph;36 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (``Central &amp; Southern''). The courts in these cases upheld the agencies'
assessment of tariff filing fees even though tariff filing was mandated by law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is also argued that carriers should not pay for such filings because the purpose of the Commission's tariff filing
program is to provide rate information to shippers.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Carriers, however, derive identifiable benefits from tariff filing. The carrier benefits of tariff filing were
explained in Central &amp; Southern, 777 F.2d at 734, n.8, in which the court observed:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
For example, JCG argue that the primary purpose of tariff filing is to ensure certainty and stability in rates that
enables a shipper to obtain the rates that its competitors receive.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The tariff-filing requirement may contribute to industry stability in at least two ways. First, it may make secret
price-cutting impossible, since tariffs are of course public records and inasmuch as a motor carrier must charge
the rate specified in its tariff. Second, the requirement may make instantaneous price cuts more difficult; before
lowering its rates to meet or undercut the competition, a carrier must go to the trouble of filing its new proposed rates
with the ICC. These statutorily provided constraints on competition, in turn, stabilize profits of individual carriers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Our conclusion that this increased industry stability warrants the imposition of a filing fee may appear, at first
blush, inconsistent with the statement . . . that a fee may not be predicated merely upon the adoption of some practice
of general benefit to the industry as a whole. Such is not the case, however. The tariff system is, in a sense, a cooperative
venture, sanctioned by statute and supported by the ICC, in which each carrier agrees to publish its rates, thereby
foregoing the opportunity of making secret, precipitous rate cuts that would be advantageous to the carrier in the
short run. In return, all the other carriers agree to similar behavior, the result of which is to stabilize prices in
the industry. As already noted, this stability is one of the chief purposes underlying the tariff-filing requirement.
The ICC, by accepting a carrier's tariffs, assists that carrier in fulfilling its obligation to the other carriers,
even as it assists the carrier in complying with its statutory duty. Hence, in these special circumstances, the ICC's
tariff-filing services benefit the individual carrier, and not merely the industry as a whole.

While the court in Central &amp; Southern was considering the benefits of the ICC's tariff filing program to surface
carriers, its observations are applicable to ocean common carriers as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NPR, the Commission recognized that there exist public benefits from tariff and ET filings, such as increased
public access to carriers' rate and service information. In cases where, as here, fees have been assessed for programs
conferring both public and private benefits, reviewing courts have concluded that there need only be a special private
benefit to an identifiable beneficiary to justify assessment of a fee, regardless of ``incidental'' public benefits.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 The court in Central &amp; Southern concluded that ``[i]f the asserted public benefits are the necessary consequence
of the agency's provision of the relevant private benefits, then the public benefits are not independent, and the
agency would therefore not need to allocate any costs to the public.'' Central &amp; Southern, 777 F.2d at 732.

A public benefit that results from nothing more than providing a private benefit, or is a necessary consequence of
the agency's providing a private benefit, would be ``incidental'' to the private benefit. In contrast, an ``independent''
public benefit is a benefit that results from additional expense or effort above and beyond providing the private
benefit. In

20 F.3d 1177, 1180 (D.C. Cir. 1994), the court noted that ``*&blank;*&blank;* the public benefits associated with
cleaner air are incidental to, not independent of, that private benefit, in the sense that they are produced at no cost
beyond that required to produce the private benefit.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The difference between ``independent'' and ``incidental'' benefits has been explained in a case involving the FCC
as follows:

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
If the Commission, in granting an equipment type approval *&blank;*&blank;* is required to incur expenses for testing
or inspection, such expenses can be charged in full to the applicant. These activities have undisputed private benefits
although they may also create incidental public benefits as well. But if the agency were to engage in further activity
to determine whether a piece of equipment which has already been found to have no potential for creating `harmful interference'.
. . meets standards for consumer safety it would be doing so to satisfy some independent public interest, and the charge
for these additional expenses could not be included in fees imposed on equipment owners. Although there may be some
private benefit in safety testing, it is not a part of the service the agency must render to the manufacturer in order
for him to comply with the statute: the additional tests service an independent public interest, with only incidental
private benefits.

Given the distinction drawn between ``independent'' and ``incidental,'' the NPR invited the industry to comment
on whether the public benefit of tariff and ET filings is ``independent'' or merely ``incidental'' to that of tariff
and ET filers, and, if ``independent,'' to comment on what proportion of the costs to tariff-filing and ET-filing
carriers should be pro-rated to reflect any ``independent'' benefit to the general public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
JCG contends that the benefit to shippers from tariff and ET filings is ``independent'' rather than ``incidental,''
and that filers therefore should not be required to pay the full cost of tariff and ET filings. JCG refers to the Report
of the Advisory Commission on Conferences in Ocean Shipping,
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 which noted that the majority of shippers supported tariff filing provisions, and stated that the provisions:

The Advisory Commission on Conferences in Ocean Shipping was established pursuant to section 18(d) of the Shipping
Act of 1984 (``1984 Act''), 46 U.S.C. app. 1717(d), to conduct a comprehensive study of conferences in ocean shipping.
The Advisory Commission issued a final report in April, 1992.

*&blank;*&blank;* Protect the shipper by requiring that a rate filed in a tariff be available to all shippers of like
transportation characteristics *&blank;*&blank;*. The notion of protecting small shippers vis-a-vis larger
shipper *&blank;*&blank;* is also widespread. Small shippers focus on this particular notion of common carriage,
and are concerned that larger shippers will get rates and/or services that they will not be able to get. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
*&blank;*&blank;* Support for [Tariff Filing and Enforcement] also came from certain shippers and shippers' associations
who use the filed rate as a benchmark when negotiating service contracts. Since part of the benefit to a shipper of signing
a service contract is obtaining a discount from the prevailing tariff rate, knowing the rate in advance provides an
effective starting point. Shippers' associations state that they also use the tariff rate as an indicator of the benefit
of a collectively negotiated service contract. Shippers' associations say they may also use the tariff to discover
the value of alternative service options for their members. Since tariffs identify both the rates and the conditions
of service, the information is available to the association to tailor the contract to the varying needs of its members.

JCG Comments at 13&hyph;14, quoting The Advisory Commission on Conferences in Ocean Shipping Report, at 117&hyph;118
(April 1992). JCG argues further that since the initiation, implementation, and, to a larger extent, oversight and
enforcement of tariff and ET filing requirements were, and are, done for the benefit of shippers and consignees, it
must be concluded that such benefits are ``independent.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Similarly, Lykes questions whether the 29 cents of the 34 cent tariff filing fee covering the cost of staff review is
actually for the benefit of the filers. Lykes argues that ATFI was initially proposed as being for the benefit of the
shipper, and that there is an ``independent'' rather than ``incidental'' public benefit from tariff and ET filings,
and that fully 50 percent of the benefits of tariff and ET filings are for the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
JCG and Lykes recommend a 50 percent reduction in any fee to be charged to a carrier or conference, arguing that at least
half of the benefit of the Commission's services can be attributed to shippers. JCG further suggests that, since Commission
services also benefit the general public, 50 percent may be too high a percentage to charge filers. The Japan Conferences
contend that no more than one-third of the Commission's tariff and ET filing processing costs should be borne by the
carrier industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These comments, urging that tariff and ET filing confer public benefits that are ``independent'' rather than ``incidental,''
have merit. In Electronics Industries, the court observed that if an agency engages in further activity beyond that
which is required to ensure statutory compliance, in order to satisfy some ``independent'' public interest, the
charges for these additional efforts could not be included in fees assessed to private applicants. Some elements
of the Commission's tariff filing program go beyond those that are necessary to ensure compliance with statutory
tariff filing requirements,
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 and instead are designed to confer a benefit on the shipping public. Specifically, the requirement in 46 CFR 514.15(a)
that carriers file algorithms with their tariffs facilitates shipper calculation of total applicable freight charges.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Similarly, the Commission incurs additional costs by carefully 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reviewing each tariff commodity description to make tariffs clearer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and more accessible to the shipping public. This review goes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beyond what is required by the statutory tariff filing provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current practice of extensively reviewing commodity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
descriptions represents an additional cost and confers an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
independent public benefit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At this time, it is not possible to quantify the amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commission costs in reviewing tariff and ET filings that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attributable to the provision of an independent public benefit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, it appears that the approach urged by the commenters_that is, the even division of these costs between
filers and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public at large_is the most equitable way of resolving the issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, the Commission is reducing the proposed tariff and ET 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filing fees by 50 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters have argued that the imposition of any tariff 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filing fee is an undue burden on the ocean transportation industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
They point out that the proposed filing fees would be a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional cost to what they have already spent to convert their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tariffs to the ATFI system. Commenters also submit that the tariff 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filing fee could prompt carriers to file tariff information in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more generic manner, and could have a chilling effect on the filing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of independent actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the Commission's own assessment and the broad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry position that tariff and ET filing fees impose an undue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burden on the industry, the Commission will seek an OMB exception 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for imposing these fees. Under OMB Circular A&hyph;25, an agency may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request that OMB grant the agency an exception from OMB's general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policy of assessing fees, permitting the agency to forego assessing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fees if conditions exist to justify an exception. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to those discussed above, respondents comment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a number of other issues concerning tariff and ET filing fees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These are addressed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
JCG, PRMSA, and the Japan Conferences raise questions about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Commission's methodology in calculating the proposed fees. JCG 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the Japan Conferences question the Commission's methodology as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being less than thorough, and argue that the Commission was unclear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in describing its time allocation methodology.

JCG contends that it is premature to propose user fees based on services provided under a system, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As explained in the NPR, the Commission employed the best 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available data to calculate the proposed filing fees, employing inhouse surveys to determine the time and cost involved
in providing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular services. Extensive time and motion studies are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessarily required. See Central &amp; Southern, 777 F.2d at 736&hyph;37. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OMB Circular A&hyph;25 provides that the ``full cost [of a service] shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be determined or estimated from the best available records of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency, and new cost accounting systems need not be established

In addition to providing an extensive explanation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commission's methodology to calculate its proposed fees, the NPR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also indicated that a detailed summary of the data used to arrive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the proposed fees was available to the public from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commission. To our knowledge, only one commenter availed itself of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this opportunity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the comment that it is premature to implement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a user fee for ATFI, the Commission explained in the NPR that OMB 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directed the Commission to pursue establishing a tariff filing fee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in 1994. Further, the Commission employed the best available data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to calculate the proposed fees. Moreover, the Commission intends 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to periodically update tariff filing fees, adjusting for changes in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs as warranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Japan Conferences question the Commission's calculations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of indirect costs assignable to fee-related services. They further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
question why the Commission included the proportional costs of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
several FMC bureaus and offices
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 that are only peripherally

As explained in the NPR, the FMC generally adopted the ICC's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methodology for determining indirect costs because the ICC's fee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
schedule and methodologies have been reviewed by the courts and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally deemed acceptable.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 See Central &amp; Southern, 777 F.2d 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at 722. Although we developed an indirect cost methodology based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the ICC's experience, we nevertheless deducted a number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenses to calculate the FMC's indirect costs. For example, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ICC employs an indirect cost item for operations overhead, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apportions senior executive time across fee-generating activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because we were able to account for senior executive time in each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service item, a separate overhead item would be redundant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, this ICC component was not included in the FMC's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculations. Additionally, in calculating our indirect costs, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deducted certain expenses that have no nexus with any fee activity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the office general and administrative component of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indirect cost calculation (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

The Japan Conference also point out that the Commission's indirect costs, calculated at 99.5 percent of direct costs,
is more than 50 percent higher than the ICC's indirect costs reviewed in Central &amp; Southern, supra 777 F.2d at 726&hyph;27.
However, the Japan Conferences fail to take into account that the ICC's indirect costs cited in Central &amp; Southern
were calculated almost ten years ago, and that the ICC's current indirect cost factor is 100.8 percent, slightly higher
than that of the FMC.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In light of appeals court precedent supporting the methodology employed in calculating the FMC's indirect costs,
and because of the attention given to include only those expenses that are relevant to our indirect cost calculations,
the Japan Conferences' arguments are rejected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
JCG also states that a tariff filing fee may act as a disincentive to taking independent action by conference members,
and further, that it could lead carriers and conferences to delay tariff filing at the expense of clarity. The Japan
Conferences recommend that the Commission calculate a flat per-tariff or per-carrier/conference fee that would
not have, they contend, a disabling effect on the independent action process or commodity-based tariffs. Similarly,
JCG urges the Commission to consider establishing a fixed annual fee for each tariff filed to avoid repeat billings
and collections and to reduce both Commission and conference/carrier administrative time and costs. JCG contends
that a flat fee would also create a certainty for filers from the standpoint of knowing the annual fees that will be paid
for tariff filing activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrative costs may decline if the Commission implements a flat annual fee for tariff filing. A flat annual fee
for tariff filing, therefore, has some appeal. Further study would be required, however, to determine the level of
a cost-based fee. Also, adoption of a flat fee is beyond the scope of this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lykes argues that the Commission should reserve a certain percentage of any user fees assessed for system enhancement
in the future, thereby addressing a certain lack of flexibility in the current system. According to Lykes, these enhanced
capabilities should include simultaneous multiple tariff access, better definition and capabilities for inland
table construction and utilization, and inclusion of transport mode in through single factor rate filings. Whatever
its merit otherwise, Lykes' suggestion is irreconcilable with the IOAA and OMB Circular A&hyph;25, which instruct
that user fee collections not be used to offset costs of activities that are not related to the specific service the
Commission is performing for an identifiable recipient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Japan Conferences comment that ATFI contractor costs should be pro-rated between filing and retrieval expenses,
otherwise the Commission will be charging twice for the same service. As explained in the NPR, only that portion of
the ATFI system cost allocated to filers was included in the proposed filing fee. Because there is no double billing
of contractor costs, the Japan Conferences' concerns are unfounded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hanjin Shipping Co., Ltd. (``Hanjin'') contends that the proposed fees constitute a tax on international trade because
such fees fail to consider international comity, that is, other countries do not require such filings and fees. Hanjin
argues that the Commission should not impose burdensome fees in the United States, where no such fees are assessed
by foreign governments on carriers operating there. Contrary to Hanjin's assertions, the proposed tariff filing
fee is not a tax. The fee is designed to recover the full cost to the Commission of performing a service that provides
tariff filers with a special benefit, as mandated by OMB Circular A&hyph;25. In

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Tampa Port Authority urges that public entities, like itself, be exempted from tariff filing fees because they
are exempted from the Commission's subscription fees. Exempting port authorities from paying subscription fees
is a courtesy provided by the Commission, since port authorities typically request Commission issuances for informational
purposes. However, tariff filing provides a specific benefit to members of the shipping public, including port authorities,
similar to that gained by private entities. No distinction would appear to exist between the status of public and private
tariff filers to justify the exemption of port authorities from filing fees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To address other matters raised concerning tariff and ET filings, the Commission clarifies that: (1) The tariff and
ET filing fee will apply even if the filing or ET is subsequently rejected; (2) billing for ETs will be based on a set of
terms for an individual service contract rather than on each term in the set, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a filer of a service contract who files a set of ten essential terms for that contract will be billed a total of $1.65,
not $16.50; (3) billing for tariff filing will be done according to a filer's logon identification number; and (4)
to the extent possible, the Commission intends to bill filers on a monthly basis.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters contend that they should not be required to pay the full cost of agreement filing because of the
broad public benefit associated with such filings, but do not elaborate on the nature and extent of this public benefit.
They also state that the proposed agreement filing fees will discourage regular compliance and encourage withholding
important changes until such time as several changes can be filed in a single amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated in the NPR, the processing of agreements benefits the filing parties because of the concomitant antitrust
immunity conferred by the Shipping Act, 1916, 46 U.S.C. app. &sect;801 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and the Shipping Act of 1984, 46 U.S.C. app. &sect;1701 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Agreements enable joint ratemaking or cost-cutting measures to accrue to the benefit of the signatory parties. The
sales revenues or cost savings, or both, can add up to millions of dollars for one carrier, let alone several carriers.
While carrier savings may eventually benefit the public, that benefit is incidental to the private benefits enjoyed
by the parties to agreements filed under the Shipping Acts. Concerns that the proposed filing fee will have a dampening
effect on filing agreements, or amendments thereto, are speculative at best and do not weigh against imposing the
proposed filing fee.

The NPR explained how filers of GRIs in the domestic offshore trades specifically benefit because of the potential
for increased revenues.

The Commission believes that carriers operating in the domestic offshore trades receive a clear and definite benefit
from GRIs, and that any public benefit flowing from Commission review of such filings is ``incidental'' to the benefits
accruing to the filers. The benefits to carriers include their potential for increased revenues, and assistance
in meeting their statutory duty to charge ``just and reasonable'' rates. Therefore, reduction of the GRI filing fee
to account for public benefit is not warranted.

Matson Navigation Company, Inc. (``Matson'') regards the imposition of a new filing fee at this time as untimely.
It points out that the Commission is considering revisions of its methodology for determining the reasonableness
of a carrier's GRIs.
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
 Matson states that the new GRI fee is based on historic cost data and that there is no indication in the NPR that the Commission
has yet made an analysis of what the costs will be under the proposed revised methodology. The Commission is therefore
urged to defer implementation of its GRI filing fee proposal until it has developed sufficient cost experience under
the new methodology to justify imposition of such a fee.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Matson's concerns themselves appear untimely, as any new GRI methodology is some time away. If and when the Commission
changes methodologies, the cost of processing GRIs under the new method will be studied and adjustment made accordingly.
For now, the Commission still employs the current method for determining the reasonableness of GRIs, and the proposed
fee reflects the current cost to the Commission of analyzing GRIs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PRMSA comments that including the agency's general and administrative costs and other indirect costs (many of which
PRMSA sees as not pertaining to the cost of processing a GRI) is unreasonable and improper. It argues that carriers
should not be required to pay Government overhead, which includes matters such as travel, furniture and other expenses
of the Commission, and which have little bearing on the processing of those documents. At a maximum, PRMSA urges that
the industry should pay only those costs that are directly related to GRI review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As explained in the NPR, the Commission employed the best available data to calculate the proposed filing fees, employing
surveys to determine the time and cost involved in providing particular services. The courts have leaned toward reasonableness
in attributing costs, not necessarily exactitude.
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 Furthermore, the Commission's method for allocating indirect costs follows what has been generally accepted in
Central &amp; Southern. Finally, the Commission deducted certain expenses from its indirect cost calculations
so that only relevant expenses remained in calculating the proposed fees.

PRMSA claims that the Commission's proposal to cover the full cost of GRI filings is arbitrary because recouping the
full cost does not extend to other types of filings such as formal complaints, petitions, and informal complaints,
none of which include the Administrative Law Judges' or Hearing Counsel's time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission's method for the assessment of user fees for GRI filings is similar to the approach used for other Commission
activities. The proposed fees for filing formal complaints, petitions, and informal complaints do not include any
cost for adjudicatory functions that they may require.
<FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>
 Similarly, the proposed fees for GRI and agreement filings do not include any cost for adjudicatory functions. The
filing fee for GRIs only covers the analytical staff work in reviewing GRIs.

Finally, PRMSA contends that the Commission's GRI fee of $11,951 is inconsistent with the fees charged by other agencies.
PRMSA cites the ICC, which charges a fee of $7,700 to process requests for nationwide and regional collectively filed
GRIs under 49 CFR 1002.2(f). FMC review of GRI filings in the domestic offshore trade is distinct in both purpose and
resource requirements from the ICC's processing of GRIs. Further, while the FMC adopted the approach used by the ICC
in developing a methodology for determining indirect costs, we recognized the need to develop our own fees due to differing
cost structures between the two agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed fees concerning applications filed by carriers in the domestic offshore trades, requesting permission
to deviate from annual reporting requirements, did not elicit any comment and are adopted as final. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the foregoing, the Commission is adopting as final the proposed new fees, as amended herein. Because the Commission
finds that there is an ``independent'' public benefit associated with tariff and ET filings, the Commission is reducing
by half the tariff filing fee to $.17 per filing object, and the ET filing fee to $1.65 per set. See Appendix B for a summary
of the new fees established in this proceeding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To permit sufficient time to develop, test, and implement billing procedures for collecting tariff and ET filing
fees, the Commission is delaying the effective date for those fees to April 1, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In keeping with OMB guidelines, the Commission intends to update its fees on an annual basis. In updating its fees,
the Commission will incorporate changes in the wages and salaries of its employees into direct labor costs associated
with its services, and recalculate its indirect costs (overhead) based on current costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the NPR, the Commission certified, pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b),
that the Proposed Rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, including
small businesses, small organizational units, and small governmental jurisdictions. The Commission did recognize,
however, that the proposed new fees may have an impact on the shipping industry, but not of the magnitude that would
be contrary to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As mentioned earlier, commenters argue that the proposed tariff and ET filing fees would significantly increase
their cost of doing business, and that this additional cost coupled with what they have already spent to convert their
paper tariffs to the ATFI system represents an undue burden on the industry.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, agencies may examine alternatives to minimize the economic burden of proposed
rules on an industry. Given the obligation to assess fees imposed on the FMC by the IOAA and OMB Circular A&hyph;25,
the Commission finds that there are no viable alternatives, and that the proposed tariff and ET filing fees, as amended
herein, are the least burdensome choice for the Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although there is no apparent alternative that would minimize the economic burden of tariff and ET filing fees on the
industry and achieve the Commission's regulatory objective, the Commission is pursuing, nevertheless, an OMB exception,
which would permit the Commission to forego collecting these fees. If the Commission receives a favorable response,
the Commission will remove these fees from its rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule does not contain any collection of information requirements as defined by the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1980, as amended. Therefore, OMB review is not required.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Memorandum Opinion and Order on Reconsideration 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
in Common Carrier Docket 87&hyph;266, the Commission substantially affirmed the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
while modifying and clarifying that Order in various respects. Among the more significant actions, we first reaffirm
the basic video dialtone regulatory construct adopted in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Local exchange carriers (LECs) offering video dialtone service must make available a common carrier platform that
provides sufficient capacity to serve multiple video programmers, and may not allocate all or substantially all
analog capacity to a single ``anchor programmer.'' Second, we clarify and modify our video dialtone policy to help
ensure that telephone ratepayers do not have to bear the costs of video dialtone. These measures should also protect
cable operators from potential anticompetitive actions by LECs, stemming from LEC incentives and opportunities
to price video dialtone service unreasonably low relative to the cost of providing such service. For instance, we
set forth specific guidance for application of our pricing rules to ensure that interstate video dialtone rates cover
video dialtone costs_both the incremental costs of video dialtone and a reasonable allocation of shared plant costs
and overheads. We also establish a data collection program to monitor the impact of video dialtone deployment on local
rates as well as on separation results. Third, we modify our assertion of exclusive jurisdiction over all video dialtone
services to recognize that states have jurisdiction over intrastate video dialtone services. This modification
should provide a sound jurisdictional basis for the exercise of federal and state regulatory authority over video
dialtone services. Finally, we issue a

Third Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking

1. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Memorandum Opinion and Order on Reconsideration, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the Commission added video dialtone service to the basic service categories for which it requires that LECs report
installation and maintenance activities. In addition, the Commission required that each of the Bell Operating Companies
(BOCs) and GTE Service Corporation (GTE) to file, by March 14, 1995, a detailed description of the types of CPNI to which
it anticipates having access as a provider of video dialtone service. The Commission directed the BOCs and GTE to explain
how they would plan to use such information in marketing video dialtone services to video programmers or consumers.
The Commission also required LECs providing video dialtone service to notify the Chief of the Common Carrier Bureau,
of any anticipated or existing capacity shortfall in their video dialtone platform and of plans for addressing such
shortfall. Such notice must be provided within thirty days after the LEC becomes aware of an anticipated shortfall

A. Sufficient Capacity to Serve Multiple Service Providers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. We affirm our requirement that telephone companies wishing to offer video dialtone service must make available
a basic common carrier platform offering sufficient capacity to serve multiple video programmers. This requirement
will enable multiple video programmers to obtain access on nondiscriminatory terms to LEC video delivery capabilities,
thereby fostering new and diverse sources of video programming and generating competition in the provision of such
programming to end users. Such competition will be generated both among users of the video dialtone platform and among
such users and video programmers that use other systems, such as cable systems, to distribute their products to end
users in the same geographic area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. We also affirm our requirement that video dialtone common carrier platforms offer sufficient capacity to serve
multiple video programmers. Without this requirement, video dialtone would not be as effective in achieving our
goal of fostering a diversity of information sources to the public. This goal was and remains one of the key purposes
of our video dialtone policy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. We reject requests that LECs be permitted to allocate all or substantially all analog capacity to a single ``anchor
programmer.'' These requests appear to be premised on the assumption that only analog capacity allows a viable alternative
to cable service in the short term. To grant these requests would thus be inconsistent with the common carrier model
for video dialtone and our requirement that LECs offer sufficient capacity to accommodate multiple video programmers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Finally, we affirm our expandability requirement, subject to the modification discussed below. This requirement,
we believe, compounds the benefits of video dialtone by ensuring greater diversity in the sources of video programming
and fostering infrastructure development. This requirement is also a critical factor in reducing the ability of
LECs to discriminate in their provision of video dialtone service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. While we affirm our capacity and expandability requirements, we take this opportunity to elaborate on the scope
of the expandability obligation. As critical as this obligation is to our video dialtone construct, it would not be
reasonable to require LECs to expand to meet all demand, regardless of technical and economic considerations. Indeed,
such a requirement might well discourage LECs from constructing and operating video dialtone systems because of
the risk of excessive idle investment. We therefore clarify that, under our video dialtone requirements, LECs are
required to expand whenever, and to the extent that, expansion is technically feasible and economically reasonable.
A LEC may not refuse to expand simply because it does not wish to permit video programmers to offer certain types of video
programming on its video dialtone system. We will address claims by LECs that expansion is not technically feasible
and economically reasonable on a case-by-case basis in light of all relevant circumstances. In this review process,
we will look to all relevant information and data, including the capacity offered on other video dialtone systems,
data relating to demand for video delivery in the LEC's region or in comparable regions, and technical data. To monitor
LEC progress in expanding capacity and to ensure that LECs expand in accordance with the standards set forth herein,
we require LECs to notify the Chief of the Common Carrier Bureau of any anticipated or existing capacity shortfall
and of plans for addressing such shortfall. Such notice must be provided within thirty days after the LEC becomes aware
of an anticipated capacity shortfall or within five days after denying capacity to a video programmer, whichever
occurs first. To the extent a LEC concludes that expansion is not technically feasible or economically reasonable
at that time, the LEC must explain in detail the basis for its determination and indicate when it anticipates expansion
would be technically feasible and economically reasonable.

B. Acquisition of Cable Facilities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
8. We substantially affirm our decision in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to prohibit telephone companies from acquiring cable facilities in their telephone service areas for the provision
of video dialtone. We believe that generally retaining the ban will benefit the public by promoting greater competition
in the delivery of video services, increasing the diversity of video programming, and advancing the national communications
infrastructure. At the same time, however, we recognize that the ban may effectively preclude the deployment of video
dialtone systems in markets that cannot support an additional wired video delivery system and could in those markets
impede our goal of eliminating regulatory barriers to investment. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Third Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
we seek information and comment that would permit us to develop criteria for identifying those markets. We also propose
to amend our rules so that these criteria serve as the basis for either an automatic exception to the ban or a presumption
that the ban should not apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. In general, opponents of the ban assert that it is an inefficient and counterproductive means of implementing video
dialtone, and one that is likely to deter widespread deployment of video dialtone. Contrary to these assertions,
we believe that retaining the ban in areas where facilities-based competition is viable will spur the development
of competitive wire-based video delivery systems, thereby offering significant benefits to consumers. First,
the added competition will likely provide a check on both cable and video dialtone rates. LECs that charge too much
for video dialtone delivery services will face the risk that video programmers will forgo video dialtone service
and rely on cable systems for distribution of their product. To the extent that competition can provide a check on video
dialtone rates, video programmers will be able to lower their rates to consumers. This, in turn, would constrain cable
rates. Second, competition between cable operators and LECs would give both incentives to invest in infrastructure
and develop new and innovative services to increase the attractiveness of their products to consumers. Third, the
availability of additional distribution systems would offer increased channel capacity, thereby fostering greater
diversity of programming options for consumers. Retaining the ban could also facilitate the development of competitive
local telephone networks by cable operators.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
10. By contrast, if we eliminate the ban, LECs might seek to acquire cable systems in their service areas to eliminate
competition in the provision of video delivery services. They might also have incentives to acquire cable facilities
to eliminate a likely competitor in the provision of local telephone services. At the same time, elimination of the
ban would unacceptably increase cable operator's incentives to move their video programming to a LEC's video dialtone
system, rather than make the changes necessary to respond effectively to competition. We therefore disagree with
parties who argue that eliminating the ban would allow market forces to dictate the deployment of video dialtone technology.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. While we thus generally retain the ban on acquisitions of cable facilities for provision of video dialtone, we
conclude that allowing telephone companies to lease cable company drop wires, if the lease is limited in scope and
duration, should be permitted. Our prohibition on acquisitions of in-region cable facilities is intended generally
to encourage the development of competing LEC and cable video delivery systems. We do not believe that permitting
LECs to lease drop wires from a cable operator for a limited term of three years on a non-exclusive basis will impede
the realization of this goal. In particular, we do not believe that any revenues that a cable operator may derive from
such leases would be sufficient to affect materially its decision to use video dialtone or provide a competitive transmission
service. Moreover, permitting LECs to lease cable drops could accelerate the delivery of video dialtone services
to end users and thus increase competition in the video marketplace. Therefore, we do not prohibit such leasing arrangements,
provided they are executed for non-renewable terms no longer than three years. At the conclusion of the three-year
period, LECs are prohibited from acquiring the cable drop wires.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. We also prohibit LECs from acquiring exclusive rights to use cable drops. Specifically, LECs may not unreasonably
restrict the access of any video programmer to leased cable drops, nor may they restrict cable operators from providing
to third parties drops not covered by the LEC lease. We will require any LEC proposing to lease cable drop wires to describe
in its Section 214 video dialtone application the material terms of that lease, including the cost of the lease to the
LEC. We will scrutinize these terms to ensure that they are reasonable and, in particular, do not undermine our goal
of promoting competitive wire-based video systems.

C. Ownership Affiliation Standards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
13. We affirm the ownership affiliation standard of up to 5%, as adopted in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We modify the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 however, by defining more clearly the application of the standard. For example, we hold that, while a nonvoting ownership
interest, which confers no power to control or influence decision making, may not implicate the purposes of the mass
media multiple ownership rules, that same interest may raise concern about incentives for discrimination. The same
could be true for a 49% interest in an entity with a single majority shareholder. In light of these different goals,
we decline to apply all aspects of the mass media multiple ownership rules to video dialtone. We do, however, modify
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by clarifying that the provisions of our mass media multiple ownership standards relating to vertical ownership
chains, not involving investment companies, do apply in the video dialtone context. While the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 did not specifically address this issue, these rules are essential to ensure that LECs cannot avoid ownership limitations
by using intervening corporate entities. We also hold that, consistent with the statutory prohibition on provision
by LECs of video programming to subscribers in their telephone service areas, an LEC may not hold an ownership interest
of 5% or greater in a video programmer that offers service in the LEC's telephone service area. For purposes of the video
dialtone rules, we define a video programmer as any person who provides video programming directly, or indirectly
through an affiliate, to subscribers. Any entity shall be deemed to ``provide'' video programming if it determines
how video programming is presented for sale to subscribers, including making decisions concerning the bundling
or ``tiering'' of the programming or the price, terms, or conditions on which the programming is offered to subscribers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. We clarify that our cross-ownership rules do not prohibit LECs from owning video programming, even programming
that another, independent programmer (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, a programmer neither owned nor controlled by the LEC) provides over the LEC's video dialtone system. Nor is any LEC
prohibited from owning entities that provide video programming outside its service area. LECs may not, however,
provide or distribute any video programming directly to subscribers in their telephone service area. Further, LECs
may not hold a cognizable ownership interest, as defined above, in any entity that provides video programming directly
to subscribers in their telephone service area.

D. Non-Ownership Relationships and Activities Between Telephone Companies and Video Programmers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
15. We affirm our decision to permit LECs to enter into non-ownership relationships that exceed a carrier-user relationship
with video programmers, but modify our rules in this area in several respects. We relax these rules in two respects:
First, we permit LECs to offer enhanced and other nonregulated services related to video programming to any video
programmer, in areas substantially served by a video dialtone platform, without regard to whether the video programmer
purchasing such services has a nexus to that platform. An area shall be considered substantially served by a video
dialtone platform if video dialtone service is available to a significant majority_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 70%_of the households in that area. Second, we permit LECs to enter into certain other types of non-ownership relationships
with video programmers who are not franchised cable operators, without regard to the existence of a video dialtone
platform.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
16. We also tighten the non-ownership rules in two respects. First, we generally prohibit LECs from exceeding the
carrier-user relationship in their telephone service area with franchised cable operators, except to provide enhanced
or other nonregulated services related to the provision of video programming in areas substantially served by a video
dialtone platform, or to lease cable drop wires. Second, we generally prohibit affiliations between LECs and any
video programmer for the purpose of operating a basic video dialtone platform.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. We relax our non-ownership rules as described above because those rules as originally structured appear to be
more restrictive than necessary to achieve our objectives. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we permitted LECs to exceed the carrier-user relationship with a video programmer, but only if that programmer was
a customer of, interconnected with, or shared the construction or operation of the basic video dialtone platfrom.
In requiring this connection, we explained that we believed it necessary ``to assure that, in exceeding the current
carrier-user relationship, telephone companies will both provide the basic platform to video programmers and use
it as the basis for their own participation in the video marketplace.'' We were concerned that, absent this link, telephone
companies might forego investing in video dialtone, limiting themselves instead to providing services on existing
cable facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18. We conclude that our goal of encouraging LECs to build and use basic video dialtone platforms can be achieved without
requiring that purchasers of LEC enhanced or other nonregulated services related to the provision of video programming
maintain a nexus to those platforms. So long as a LEC has built a basic platform that satisfies our video dialtone requirements,
and that is available in a particular video programmer's service area, there is no public interest justification
for prohibiting the LEC from offering enhanced or other nonregulated services to that video programmer, even if the
programmer has no nexus to the platform. Indeed, permitting that video programmer to purchase such services from
the LEC expands the range of potential customers of LEC enhanced and nonregulated services, thereby increasing LEC
incentives to build video dialtone systems. At the same time, permitting LECs to provide services to video programmers
who have no nexus to a video dialtone platform, including cable operators, benefits video programmers by enabling
them to take advantage of such services, even if they choose not to use video dialtone as their transmission medium.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
19. We recognize that a video programmer's service area often will not coincide precisely with the area served by a
video dialtone platform. For example, a cable operator's franchise service area that substantially overlaps a video
dialtone service area may include households outside the video dialtone service area. In that situation, so long
as the LEC has made video dialtone available to a significant majority of the households in the area in which the cable
company seeks enhanced or other nonregulated services from the LEC, there would be no reason to prohibit the LEC from
providing enhanced or other nonregulated services to that cable operator. We therefore hold that LECs may provide
enhanced and other nonregulated services within their telephone service area to a video programmer if video dialtone
is available to a significant majority of the households in the area in which the video programmer seeks such services.
We also hold that, for purposes of applying this rule, 70% of the households in the area in which a video programmer seeks
enhanced or other nonregulated services would constitute a ``significant majority.'' We acknowledge that this
seventy percent standard is not the only standard that we could have adopted. We believe, however, that this standard
is reasonable because it does require that video dialtone be available to a significant majority of households within
the area in which the video programmer seeks to take LEC nonregulated services and thus provides LECs with the necessary
incentives to deploy video dialtone.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20. We also permit LECs to enter into certain other non-ownership relationships (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, joint ventures and debt financing) within their service area with video programmers who are not cable operators,
without regard to the existence of a video dialtone platform. Eliminating the requirement that LECs build a video
dialtone platform before establishing these other relationships will not compromise our goal of encouraging video
dialtone deployment. The revenues offered by a video dialtone system, including the ability of LECs to provide enhanced
and other nonregulated services in areas substantially served by video dialtone, should provide ample incentives
for LECs to construct video dialtone platforms. Indeed, it is not clear that the rule adopted in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
would further the goal of ensuring widespread deployment of video dialtone systems. Under that rule, it could be argued
that a LEC could enter into a non-ownership relationship with any video programmer who had a nexus to a single video
dialtone platform of that LEC. Thus, for example, a LEC could provide debt financing to a national video programmer
if that programmer offered one program on one video dialtone platform operated by that LEC. We do not believe that this
required nexus has a sufficiently compelling relationship to our goals to retain it.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
21. While we thus liberalize our non-ownership relationship rules in certain respects, we also narrow these rules
in other respects. First, we generally prohibit LECs from exceeding the carrier-user relationship in their telephone
service area with any franchised cable operator, except (as described above) to provide enhanced or other nonregulated
services related to the provision of video programming in an area substantially served by a video dialtone platform,
or to lease cable drop wires. One of the primary goals of this proceeding is to lay the groundwork for the development
of competition in wire-based video delivery services. We believe that allowing a broad range of affiliations between
LECs and cable operators in a LEC's telephone service area could undermine this goal. For example, permitting LECs
and cable operators to construct or operate jointly a video dialtone platform could encourage cable operators to
abandon their facilities in favor of the video dialtone platform. Indeed, we consider it highly unlikely that a cable
operator would participate in the construction or operation of a video dialtone system unless it planned to use or
was using that platform. In that event, the public would lose the benefit of competition provided by the cable system.
Conversely, LECs might be inclined to underwrite a cable operator instead of building competing video distribution
systems. Moreover, even in markets in which LECs build video, dialtone systems, incentives to compete vigorously
could be tempered by debt financing, joint ventures, and other non-ownership relationships with the cable operator.
We are particularly concerned about that possibility given that, in the near-term, the LEC and cable operator are
likely to be the only two wire-based video systems in most markets. Under the circumstances, the risks of anticompetitive
consequences outweigh any public gain that could be offered by permitting such relationships. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22. Second, we generally prohibit cable operators or any other video programmers from participating in the operation
of a basic video dialtone platform. Unlike LECs, which are subject to Title II of the Communications Act, and, in the
case of the largest LECs, nonstructural safeguards designed to prevent or reveal discrimination, video programmers
are subject to no Title II nondiscrimination obligations or requirements. We therefore conclude that, without special
safeguards, permitting video programmers wide latitude in participating in the operation of the basic video dialtone
platform raises too great a risk of discrimination. Nevertheless, we may permit discrete roles for video programmers
in operating the video dialtone platform if we conclude that the benefits of permitting such roles outweigh any risk
of discrimination that they raise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
23. These modifications, aside, we otherwise affirm our rules governing non-ownership affiliations. We also affirm
that we are not statutorily precluded from allowing LECs to exceed the carrier-user relationship in providing video
dialtone service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
24. To summarize, LECs may provide enhanced or other nonregulated services related to the provision of video programming
to any video programmer, including a cable operator, in areas substantially served by a video dialtone platform.
LECs may also enter into other types of non-ownership relationships with video programmers that are not franchised
cable operators, except that they generally may not jointly operate the video dialtone platform. LECs may not, however,
otherwise exceed the carrier-user relationship in their telephone service area with franchised cable operators,
except to lease cable drop wires. We believe that these modifications of the non-ownership affiliation rules make
them more consistent with our overall video dialtone policies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
25. We note that LECs remain unrestricted in the provision of enhanced or other nonregulated services unrelated to
the provision of video programming, whether within or outside the LEC service area. LECs also remain unrestricted
in the provision of video programming directly to subscribers outside their service area. Finally, for purposes
of our non-ownership affiliation rules, we will treat debt that is convertible to stock as non-cognizable unless
the interest is converted, or, based on an analysis of the specific facts involved, we conclude that the interest confers
control over a video programmer. This is consistent with our treatment of convertible debt in other areas. Moreover,
to the extent the equity interest would be impermissible, LECs would be unable lawfully to convert the debt. Therefore,
it is proper to view it as debt, rather than equity, unless and until any such conversion occurs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, of exclusive jurisdiction over all video dialtone services. We hold that we have exclusive jurisdiction over only
interstate video dialtone services, which include services involving delivery of video communications that are
part of a continuous stream of communication provided at least partially by means of radio waves. We hold that states
have jurisdiction over intrastate video dialtone services.

, the court held that channel service provided by a LEC for a cable operator, formerly known as a community antenna television
operator, is ``an integral component in an indivisible dissemination system which forms an interstate channel of
communication from the broadcaster to the viewer.'' The court held that the Commission has exclusive jurisdiction
over LEC provision of services that form part of a broadcast transmission. Because broadcasting is inherently interstate,
the court held, LEC delivery of signals that have been broadcast over radio waves is interstate, even if the LEC delivers
such signals over physically intrastate facilities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, we conclude that broadcast or other radio-based video signals delivered by a LEC over a video dialtone system constitute
an integral part of an interstate radio transmission service. Accordingly, we have exclusive jurisdiction over
video dialtone services involving delivery of video communications that are part of a continuous stream of communication
provided at least partially by means of radio waves. A determination of whether certain other, non-radio-based video
dialtone services are interstate and thus within our exclusive jurisdiction depends upon the nature of the communication,
as in the telephone context. For example, we have exclusive jurisdiction over all video dialtone services provided
between two or more states because such services are interstate. In contrast, under Section 2(b) of the Communications
Act, states retain authority to regulate intrastate video dialtone service to the extent such regulation has not
been preempted by the Commission under the standards set forth in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Louisiana Public Service Commission v. FCC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and its progeny. For example, states have jurisdiction over the delivery by wire of video programming between a video
library and an end-user located within the same state, as part of a video-on-demand service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30. While we do not in this proceeding preempt any state regulation of intrastate video dialtone services, we note
that we have already preempted certain state regulations of BOC provision of enhanced services in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
BOC Safeguards Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 57 FR 4373 (February 5, 1992). In that decision, we preempted any state regulation requiring (1) Separation of facilities
and personnel to provide the intrastate portion of jurisdictionally mixed enhanced services; or (2) prior authorization
for use of Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI) whenever such authorization is not required by our rules.
Because we have explicitly applied our existing enhanced services safeguards to video dialtone, state regulation
in the areas preempted in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
BOC Safeguards Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, are also preempted by that decision in the video dialtone context. We reject various parties' requests for broader
preemption at this time, but we will consider preempting any state regulation of intrastate video dialtone service
that is not severable from interstate service if such regulation would negate federal policy.

G. Section 214 Process
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
31. We now affirm our decision to require LECs to obtain approval pursuant to Section 214 of the Act before beginning
construction of video dialtone facilities or offering video dialtone service. We reject arguments that we lack authority
to require such approval or that we should refrain from exercising that authority at this time. Because video dialtone
is based upon new and evolving technologies, the Section 214 process is critical to our ability to ensure that video
dialtone is implemented in a manner that best serves the public interest. Nevertheless, we permit LECs to seek generic
approval of those aspects of a video dialtone system that do not require case-by-case review. In addition, we anticipate
that, over time, as the service evolves and precedents are established, it may no longer be necessary to require the
same level of Section 214 scrutiny to future video dialtone offerings. We will consider, at that time, on our own motion
or on petitions of parties, streamlining our Section 214 requirements for video dialtone offerings.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. FCC Authority to Require Section 214 Certification
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
32. As an initial matter, we conclude that the Commission has jurisdiction to require LECs to obtain Section 214 certification
to upgrade existing facilities to provide video dialtone. Section 214(a) requires a carrier to obtain certification
before constructing or extending a line it will use for interstate communications. Even facilities that are wholly
located within a state are interstate for Section 214 purposes, if a LEC uses those facilities at least in part for interstate
communications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
33. We conclude further that an upgrade of LEC facilities to offer video dialtone service constitutes the establishment
or extension of a ``line'' pursuant to Section 214. In 1944, Congress amended Section 214 to define ``line'' as a ``channel
of communication established by appropriate equipment *&blank;*&blank;*.'' Because video dialtone systems create
new channels of communication, the systems constitute the establishment of lines under Section 214.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
34. We also conclude that video dialtone systems involve ``new construction.'' The exemption in Section 214 for ``any
installation, replacement, or other changes in plant, operation, or equipment, other than new construction'' applies
only if no new construction occurs, or any new construction or installation is minor. The upgrading of existing facilities
to be used for video dialtone thus does not fall within this exemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
35. Furthermore, we conclude that new construction occurs even when LECs upgrade existing facilities to provide
video dialtone through the addition of small amounts of equipment, because such upgrades enable the LECs to offer
a new and different type of interstate service. Section 214 requires a carrier to obtain certification before upgrading
existing intrastate facilities for interstate service. Thus, upgrading customer loops, which are currently used
primarily for intrastate local exchange service, to provide video dialtone service, constitutes ``new construction,''
and Section 214 certification is required. Moreover, because the construction of video dialtone systems does not
constitute the construction of ``local, branch, or terminal lines not exceeding ten miles in length,'' we reject
arguments that we should apply the statutory exemption contained in Section 214(a)(2) of the Communications Act
to LEC video dialtone Section 214 applications.

2. Elimination or Streamlining of Section 214 Requirement for Video Dialtone
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
36. We decline to eliminate or streamline the Section 214 certification process at this time. We reject arguments
that the tariff review process is at this time, by itself, an adequate mechanism for overseeing video dialtone deployment.
Because video dialtone is an emerging technology, and because we anticipate and encourage variations in networks,
architectures, technology, and services, many important policy issues would likely be raised only in connection
with specific video dialtone proposals. Therefore, streamlining our Section 214 process could preclude us from
properly overseeing video dialtone deployment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
37. For similar reasons, we also decline to limit the type of construction or deployment subject to full Section 214
review. Particularly during the early stages of video dialtone implementation, even those applications that propose
previously approved architectures may pose other issues that warrant careful consideration in the context of that
specific proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
38. While we do not streamline our Section 214 process at this time, we will consider generic applications for approval
of those aspects of a Section 214 application that do not require case-by-case consideration. These generic applications
can serve to narrow the range of issues to be considered in the Section 214 process. We also note that we anticipate that,
as video dialtone evolves, and we develop a body of precedent governing its implementation, the Section 214 process
may become a less critical vehicle for identifying and addressing policy issues, thereby making streamlining appropriate
at that time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
39. Finally, as another possible means of expediting the Section 214 process, we direct the Bureau to consider whether
it would serve the public interest to clarify in a Public Notice the basic information that the Commission requires
in a video dialtone Section 214 application. We note that the Bureau has found it necessary to request additional information
from LECs in connection with the Bureau's review of virtually every application that has been filed for Section 214
authorization to construct a commercial video dialtone system. Further clarification of the information required
in a Section 214 application could help LECs avoid the delays that necessarily result when applications have to be
supplemented.

3. Delaying Section 214 Certifications
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
40. We determined in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and affirm now that our existing rules and safeguards generally will prevent improper cross-subsidization and discrimination
by LECs in the provision of video dialtone. Therefore, we do not believe that an additional comprehensive review of
these rules is necessary prior to the implementation of video dialtone service. Indeed, to the extent that any further
changes in these rules may be necessary, permitting deployment of video dialtone should provide us with a better basis
for fashioning such changes. While we thus decline to defer consideration of Section 214 applications pending a comprehensive
review of our rules, we will condition the granting of each Section 214 certificate on implementation of any accounting
and other safeguards that we have adopted or subsequently adopt.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
H. Cross-Subsidy/Pricing Issues
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Overview
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
41. We conclude that initial video dialtone service offerings by LECs subject to price cap regulation should be subject
to the existing price cap rules. Proceeding under existing price cap rules is consistent with eliminating regulatory
barriers and distorted incentives to efficient investment in telecommunications facilities, thereby serving
our goals of increasing video services competition and investment in telecommunications infrastructure, and promoting
greater diversity of video programming. We also conclude that these rules, as further delineated below, should protect
telephone ratepayers from improperly subsidizing video dialtone service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
42. As Joint Petitioners point out, LECs, along with other telecommunications providers, may, over time, invest
billions of dollars to build a modern telecommunications infrastructure. We share their concern regarding possible
effects of video dialtone investment on basic regulated telephone rates, and possible anticompetitive results
with respect to cable television service and other multichannel video programming distributors. We are committed
to implementing video dialtone in a manner that does not subject basic telephone ratepayers to unreasonable rate
increases or allow improper cross-subsidization. We do not, however, agree that ratepayer protection requires
that this Commission adopt comprehensive, video dialtone-specific accounting and cost allocation rules before
authorizing video dialtone services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
43. Contrary to the arguments of the Joint Petitioners, this Commission's actions in authorizing interstate video
dialtone services will not require increases in telephone rates on the order of $20 per month to pay for the cost of a
nationwide fiber-to-the-home network. No LEC Section 214 application for video dialtone service has proposed a
fiber-to-the-home architecture, and it appears unlikely based on the record that anyone will. In addition, where
integrated networks are proposed, much of the investment will be used in the provision of intrastate telephone services,
and will require the necessary state regulatory approvals. We also note that investment in video dialtone will, of
necessity, proceed over a period of years, permitting Federal and State regulators to monitor the results of the initial
deployments and take any actions that might be needed to prevent large amounts of video dialtone investment from being
improperly shifted to ratepayers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
44. We decline, however, to adopt technology-specific cost accounting rules. The record in this proceeding demonstrates
that such cost accounting rules can be rapidly overtaken by technological or marketplace changes. Joint Petitioners,
for example, supported in their pleadings the establishment of accounts to identify loop investment as either copper
or fiber. Such accounts, had we adopted them in 1992, would no longer serve the purposes envisioned by their proponents
because carriers have since that time developed proposals to incorporate a third transmission medium, coaxial cable,
into the loop.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
45. While we do not propose to amend Parts 32, 64, 36, and 69 of our rules before authorizing video dialtone services,
we find that adjustments are necessary to fit video dialtone into our regulatory program. These adjustments, which
will be implemented on a case-by-case basis and do not require further rulemaking at this time, are explained below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
46. We view the price cap regulatory regime, and not the Part 36/Part 69 cost allocation scheme, as our primary means
of protecting the telephone customers of price cap LECs from unreasonably high rates. Under price caps, a LEC has no
guarantee that it will be able to recover increased costs in telephone rates. Its incentive to ``shift'' costs from
video dialtone to regulated telephone services is thus greatly reduced.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
47. In addition, the price cap baskets and service categories limit the extent to which price reductions in one service
can be offset by price increases in another. We conclude that a separate price caps basket for video dialtone services
may be necessary both to protect interstate telephone ratepayers and to deter anti-competitive pricing of video
dialtone services. Therefore, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Price Caps Performance Review
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 docket, 59 FR 23042 (May 4, 1994), we will seek comment on a proposal to establish that basket.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
48. We recognize that LECs under rate base/rate of return regulation (ROR) or the optional incentive plan may also
wish to develop video dialtone services. Such carriers will bear the burden of demonstrating to us how they will ensure
that the costs of video dialtone will not be improperly recovered in the rates charged for other interstate services.
They, like the price cap LECs, will also be required to comply with the other safeguards adopted in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Memorandum Opinion and Order on Reconsideration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
49. We deny requests by parties that seek a comprehensive examination of both jurisdictional separations and access
charge rules in this proceeding. As explained above, we believe our existing rules adequately protect consumers
against improper cross-subsidy and anti-competitive activity at this time. As video dialtone systems are implemented
and we gain more experience with this new service, we can amend our rules if necessary or appropriate to address unanticipated
problems or results. We agree that long-term video dialtone cost allocation issues would be a part of any comprehensive
review of Parts 36 or 69. We do not think, however, that the public interest would be well served by postponing for consumers
the benefits that video dialtone services may offer pending the commencement and completion of such proceedings.
Therefore, and for the reasons discussed in more detail below, we reject requests for adoption of video dialtone-specific
accounting, cost allocation, separations, and pricing rules prior to granting video dialtone authorizations.

2. Part 32_Uniform System Accounts for Telecommunications Companies
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
50. We reject the parties' requests that we amend our accounting rules to require carriers providing video dialtone
to segregate all video plant investment in new Part 32 accounts or separate subaccounts. Part 32 accounting rules
were designed to create a stable basic account structure that would not require modifications as technologies, services,
or reporting requirements change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
51. We further conclude that, in the case of video dialtone, our regulatory information needs can be satisfied without
making permanent changes to the accounting system at this time. Because it would help our monitoring effort and tariff
review process to have a record of LEC video dialtone costs, we hereby require that LECs offering video dialtone identify
all video dialtone costs by establishing two sets of subsidiary accounting records: one to capture the revenues,
investments and expenses wholly dedicated to video dialtone, the other to capture any revenues, investments and
expenses that are shared between video dialtone and the provision of other services. These accounting records will
also assist state regulators in assuring that video dialtone costs are not improperly included in local rates. LECs
authorized to provide video dialtone must file a summary of these subsidiary records with the Commission on a quarterly
basis. All video dialtone Section 214 authorizations will be conditioned upon compliance with this requirement.
We delegate to the Chief, Common Carrier Bureau, the authority to determine the content and format of the subsidiary
accounting records as well as the quarterly reports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 -->
3. Part 64_Separation of Regulated and Nonregulated Costs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
52. We reject claims that we should amend Part 64 because current rules would not prevent LECs from improperly subsidizing
video dialtone nonregulated services. To the contrary, we conclude that existing Part 64 rules do not require modification
to prevent such an outcome.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
53. The Joint Cost 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
rules set forth in Part 64 were formulated to accommodate new enhanced services offerings in an increasingly competitive
telecommunications environment. Part 64, for the most part, does not prescribe cost categories or allocation factors.
Rather, each carrier selects, subject to public comment and Commission review, the cost pools and allocators it needs
to identify the costs of all of its nonregulated activities. The Commission chose this approach because it believed
that the mix of nonregulated activities and the organizational structure would vary widely from carrier to carrier,
and that a single, prescribed manual could not adequately encompass the possible variations. No party has shown that
video dialtone-related nonregulated products and services will exhibit, initially, less variety than other nonregulated
activities, or will be more amenable to uniform treatment. Similarly, parties that object to the aggregation of video
dialtone-related nonregulated costs with the costs of other nonregulated activities fail to explain what valid
regulatory purpose of this Commission would be served by revisiting our determination in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Joint Cost Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
52 FR 6557 (March 4, 1987), to avoid product-specific cost allocations to nonregulated products and services. Therefore,
we decline to promulgate video dialtone-specific cost allocation rules for nonregulated activities related to
video dialtone service at this time. However, we may require uniformity in the video dialtone cost allocation procedures
in the future as we gain experience with video dialtone services and LEC Part 32 subsidiary accounting records.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
54. Under our rules, interested parties, as well as the Commission, will have ample opportunity to review the application
of Part 64 to video dialtone-related nonregulated offerings. All LECs with $100 million or more in annual operating
revenues are required to keep their current Part 64 Cost Allocation Manuals (CAMs) on file with this Commission. To
assist State regulators and other interested parties in tracking video dialtone-related CAM filings, we hereby
require that any LEC receiving authorization to provide video dialtone file CAM amendments within thirty days after
the effective date of the Section 214 authorization and at least sixty days prior to providing nonregulated products
or services related to video dialtone. Video dialtone-related CAM amendments are subject to public comment and will
be closely scrutinized by the Commission. Changes to time reporting procedures, cost apportionment tables, and
the affiliate transactions statement can, if necessary, be suspended for up to 180 days, after which the Bureau may
either allow the new procedures to become effective or prescribe different procedures.

4. Part 36_Jurisdictional Separations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
55. We decline the parties' requests that we institute at this time Federal-State Joint Board proceedings to amend
our Part 36 jurisdictional separations rules for video dialtone service. For the time being, LECs will allocate regulated
video dialtone investment and expenses between the State and Federal jurisdictions in accordance with existing
rules. To ensure that our decisions do not have untoward effects outside of our regulatory jurisdiction, we are directing
the Common Carrier Bureau to monitor the impact of video dialtone on separations results and on intrastate local telephone
rates, and to report its findings periodically to this Commission. This course of action will provide us and State
regulators with the practical experience and the data necessary to make appropriate decisions concerning the future
of the Part 36 rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
56. Joint Petitioners and others have complained that existing separations rules would assign to the States 75% of
increased loop costs attributable to video dialtone, but no video dialtone revenues. This argument is premised on
our jurisdictional determination in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
which we now modify on reconsideration. Thus, regulated video dialtone services of a purely intrastate nature may
be tariffed in the intrastate jurisdiction. The availability of intrastate video dialtone revenues should help
offset any increase in intrastate costs caused by LEC provision of video dialtone services and help prevent any local
rate increases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
57. In declining to institute a Joint Board proceeding to address issues raised by the particular video dialtone proposals
now pending before the Commission, we do not mean to imply that we will never revisit Part 36. Indeed, it appears likely
that, as telecommunications networks and the marketplace evolve, the separations rules will require revision.
In our judgment, however, it is too soon to begin proceedings to propose specific rule changes in this area. Video dialtone
is but the first of what we expect to be an array of broadband services, and the current video dialtone proposals may
or may not be representative of the manner in which those services will use network facilities, or of the jurisdictional
mix of those services. Under these circumstances, scarce Federal and State regulatory resources should not be expended
to craft separations rules tailored to video dialtone.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
58. We will take the following steps to help ensure that local telephone ratepayers are not being harmed by the advent
of video dialtone_a preeminent concern of State commenters. We direct the Common Carrier Bureau to develop a data
collection program that will track the impact of video dialtone on both separations results and intrastate telephone
rates. As part of this program, the Bureau will require all carriers offering video dialtone to submit detailed explanations
of how they are applying the Part 36 rules, as well as Parts 32, 61, and 64, to video dialtone investments and expenses.
The Bureau will report is results periodically so that this Commission and State regulators can determine when and
if rule changes or other actions appear necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
59. We also will open an inquiry proceeding focusing on a matter of paramount concern to both Federal and State regulators_the
implications for the jurisdictional separations process of the introduction of new technologies, including broadband
technology, into LEC networks. This proceeding will provide a forum for exploring the broader separations policy
issues raised by continuing changes in network technology, of which video dialtone is but one example. The inquiry
also will be a vehicle for updating, in light of actual video dialtone experience, the record created in the instant
proceeding. We strongly encourage active State commission involvement in our inquiry and seek to establish a dialogue
between State and Federal regulators on these issues. The information we gather in this inquiry could serve as a basis
for future rulemaking proposals as we examine our existing rules in light of the evolving nature of LEC networks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
60. State commissions, of course, bear the primary responsibility for ensuring that intrastate rates are reasonable.
We emphasize that neither our decisions in this proceeding nor our actions on the various video dialtone Section 214
applications preempt the State commissions from disallowing from local telephone service rates any video dialtone-related
costs that do not meet their own standards for inclusion in rates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
61. Finally, some parties contend that Section 410(c) of the Communications Act legally compels us to refer all separations
issues, including use of common plant for video dialtone, to a Joint Board. Although Section 410(c) requires the Commission
to refer separations issues to a Joint Board upon instituting a notice and comment rulemaking proceeding, we are not
proposing to modify any separations rules here but are simply applying our existing rules. We conclude that we have
the authority to apply existing jurisdictional separations rules during the initial phase of video dialtone service
deployment. Our initial determinations regarding implementation of existing jurisdictional separations to video
dialtone are, of course, subject to revision as we gain further experience with video dialtone.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
62. We conclude that access to the basic video dialtone platform is a form of interstate access to the extent it is used
to route interstate video programming to end users. We also conclude that a separate access charge category for video
dialtone may be desirable to help ensure that interstate video dialtone costs are not recovered through charges for
access services provided to interexchange carriers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
63. We decline, however, to prescribe a new rate element or to initiate a notice of proposed rulemaking at this time.
We recognize that the access charge rules define rate elements established for traditional telephone facilities.
Video dialtone may use both new and existing network facilities to deliver services in ways not contemplated at the
time the Part 69 rules were written. Because video dialtone is a nascent service, though, and in light of the wide variety
of possible video dialtone architectures LECs may employ, we find that there is a significant risk that any uniform
rate structure we would prescribe now would fail to produce rate elements that logically match each carrier's video
dialtone offering.

64. Instead, as the Commission has done in the past with other new services, we will require local telephone companies
that wish to offer video dialtone services to file petitions for waiver of our Part 69 rules prior to the establishment
of a permanent video dialtone rate structure. The waiver process, as an interim solution, will afford all interested
parties an opportunity to participate, and challenge or support the rate structure proposed by the local telephone
company. The waiver process will also provide a forum for reviewing the cost allocation proposals of ROR and optional
incentive plan carriers.

6. Part 61_Price Cap Treatment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
65. We conclude that price cap local telephone companies should continue to be subject to the existing price cap rules
for their provision of video dialtone services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
66. We also conclude that video dialtone service is a ``new service'' under our price cap rules. New services are services
that ``add to the range of options already available to customers.'' In contrast to restructured services, which
involve the rearrangement of existing services, video dialtone adds to the range of options for customers because
multiple video programmers will have access to a basic common carrier platform for the first time. Video dialtone
thus differs from a carriers's provision of channel service or other video transport services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
67. Local telephone companies will be required to make a cost-based showing under the price caps new services test
to establish initial video dialtone prices. As explained below, this test, as applied in established tariff review
processes, provides an adequate vehicle for full consideration of the reasonableness of proposed video dialtone
rates. We therefore find it unnecessary to initiate a rulemaking to develop new, video dialtone-specific tariffing
requirements. We also conclude that, given our current dearth of experience with video dialtone tariffs, it would
be both premature and counterproductive to attempt to promulgate such rules at this time. The first few tariff proceedings
will provide a far more concrete and realistic factual context for future decision making than would be developed
in a general rulemaking proceeding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
68. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Application of the LEC Price Cap New Services Test.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We decline to amend the new services test specifically for video dialtone services. The Commission currently has
generally applicable rules in place that specify the cost support that must be submitted with any new service tariff,
including a video dialtone tariff. Pursuant to these rules, carriers must submit engineering studies, time and wage
studies, or other cost accounting studies to identify the direct costs of video dialtone. LECs have proposed a number
of different network architectures for video dialtone, and there are wide variations in the manner in which, and the
degree to which, LECs are proposing to integrate their video dialtone systems with their telephone networks. This
diversity and experimentation, which we view as beneficial to the development of a modern telecommunications infrastructure,
precludes us from adopting a one-size-fits-all rule for the identification of video dialtone direct costs. The tariff
review process, which includes the possibility of tariff investigations under Section 204(a), will allow close
examination of each LEC proposal and enable us to require such cost information as may be necessary to evaluate each
proposal. If the application of our existing rules has unintended consequences, or if the process reveals systematic
problems, we will revisit our determination to rely on existing procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
69. We conclude, however, that it is important that we provide more specific guidance regarding the identification
of direct costs in video dialtone tariffs than is ordinarily given. LECs may, over time, make large investments to
upgrade their networks for video dialtone and other broadband services. The large amounts of investment involved,
and the serious concerns about cross-subsidization expressed in the record of the instant proceeding, suggest that
video dialtone rates will be subject to intense scrutiny. We conclude that the video dialtone tariff review process
will proceed more smoothly, and LECs and interested parties will be able to participate more constructively, if they
better understand our expectations in advance of tariff filings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
70. Because video dialtone is an essential component of a multichannel video service that will compete directly with
cable television operators and other multichannel video programming providers, LECs may have an incentive to understate
the direct costs of the service in order to set unreasonably low prices and engage in cross-subsidization. Therefore,
as explained below, we will require the LECs to submit with their video dialtone tariffs a more detailed and complete
identification of direct costs than we have generally required in other new services filings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
71. Under our established practice, direct costs include the costs and cost components associated with the primary
plant investment that is used to provide the service. In the case of video dialtone, some of these plant costs will be
incremental costs associated with plant dedicated to video dialtone service. The direct costs of video dialtone
will also include any incremental costs that are associated with shared plant used to provide video dialtone and other
services, that is, costs of shared plant that are caused by the carrier's decision to offer video dialtone service.
In reviewing video dialtone tariffs, we will scrutinize the basis on which those costs are identified and included
in the proposed charges for video dialtone services. We recognize and accept the challenges inherent in determining
which costs are truly the consequences of a carrier's decision to provide video dialtone service, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, are incremental costs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
72. Moreover, we expect LECs to include in direct costs a reasonable allocation of other costs that are associated
with shared plant used to provide video dialtone and other services. We will scrutinize the basis on which those costs
are identified and included in the proposed charges. An LEC allocating an extremely low proportion of these other
costs of shared plant to video dialtone will be expected to provide a strong justification for that approach, and we
do not anticipate accepting a 0% allocation of the common costs of shared plant as reasonable.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
73. Ordinarily carriers decide, in the first instance, whether to include in their direct cost studies any categories
of costs (investment and expenses) in addition to primary plant. For video dialtone, however, we direct carriers
to treat costs in other accounts as direct costs if those costs are reasonably identifiable as incremental costs of
video dialtone service. Examples of accounts that might include reasonably identifiable incremental costs of video
dialtone are those to which carriers book costs associated with land, buildings, network administration, testing,
engineering, plant operations administration, product management, sales, advertising, customer services, and
legal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
74. For purposes of the new services test, all costs not treated as direct costs are classified as overheads. Carriers
bear the burden of justifying why their overhead loadings do not produce a final rate that is unreasonably high. As
with shared plant, we will also require a strong justification for allocation of extremely low overheads to video
dialtone service, and would not anticipate accepting a 0% allocation of overhead as reasonable. At the same time,
we emphasize that we are not seeking to saddle video dialtone with an unreasonable proportion of overheads and other
common costs. We hope and expect that video dialtone will be a successful service in the marketplace, and therefore
contribute to the recovery of common costs. We recognize that imposing excessive cost burdens on video dialtone could
diminish demand and possibly overall revenues and thereby thwart these objectives. Accordingly, the effects of
price changes on video dialtone demand should be given due consideration in determining what constitutes a reasonable
allocation of common costs and overheads. In this regard, we will scrutinize the basis for claims and projections
of demand elasticities submitted in support of proposed video dialtone rates. And, of course, our rules will provide
interested parties ample opportunity to comment on these claims and projections.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
75. In implementing this specific guidance, we direct the Chief, Common Carrier Bureau, to ensure that video dialtone
carriers file all the information necessary for purposes of evaluating the costs of providing video dialtone service
and the reasonableness of the proposed cost allocations and overhead loadings. We further direct the Chief, Common
Carrier Bureau, to consider whether the Bureau should adopt specific minimum requirements, including the possible
use of standardized formats, for the supporting documentation that video dialtone providers must furnish with their
proposed tariffs. We note that the Bureau previously has adopted such requirements in connection with the LECs' annual
access tariff filings, as well as tariffs filed to provide specific services, such as Open Network Architecture (ONA)
and Expanded Interconnection services. The goal of any such requirements would be to make the review of video dialtone
tariffs by the Bureau and interested members of the public more expeditious and less costly. In addition to making
the tariff review process more accessible to interested parties, the establishment of minimum standard format and
information requirements would facilitate their ability to participate in a meaningful way.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
76. We tentatively conclude that a separate price cap basket for video dialtone would help prevent improper cross-subsidization
by preventing local telephone companies from offsetting a price reduction for video dialtone service with an increase
in rates for other regulated interstate services. However, it is not necessary to establish this basket now, on an
interim basis. Because no tariffs for permanent video dialtone service have yet been filed, it is unlikely that any
such tariff will go into effect prior to January 1, 1995. July 1, 1996 is thus the earliest date on which a video dialtone
service could be included in a price cap index. We therefore will seek comment on establishing a separate price cap
basket for video dialtone service in a supplemental notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
LEC Price Cap Performance Review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
77. At this time we will not address the merits of whether basket-by-basket earnings calculation should be required.
We recognize that investment in video dialtone facilities may generate costs that will have an impact on sharing.
Issues regarding sharing, however, are being examined in the LEC Price Cap Performance Review.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the near term, we will continue to determine sharing and lower end adjustments on an overall interstate basis.

I. Two-level Regulatory Framework and Application of Other Enhanced Service Safeguards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
78. We now affirm our decision in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to adopt a two-level regulatory framework for video dialtone services and to require the BOCs and GTE to comply with
our existing enhanced services safeguards. In adopting a two-level regulatory framework, we noted that this dichotomy
tracks our existing regulatory framework for LEC basic and enhanced services. We do not think the public interest
would be well-served by adopting a different set of rules for video dialtone services, particularly given that LECs
will provide both video and non-video offerings through these systems. Moreover, the two-level framework should
promote competition and broaden consumer choice. The level-one common carrier platform will enable multiple video
service providers, for the first time, to obtain access on a nondiscriminatory basis to the basic network functions
that will allow such service providers to distribute their services to consumers. Requiring LECs to offer nonregulated
services subject to existing safeguards for the provision of such services will help ensure that LECs are not able
to compete unfairly with other enhanced service providers and that LECs cannot bundle enhanced and nonregulated
services with basic services in order to impede competition.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
79. We also affirm the Commission's decision to apply existing enhanced service safeguards to BOC and GTE provision
of nonregulated level-two video dialtone services. No party offers any new evidence or argument that would persuade
us that this decision should be revised.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
80. We also reject arguments that we should adopt more stringent requirements at this time, such as requiring LECs
to offer all level-two services through a separate subsidiary. Here again, commenters have raised no new issues or
arguments. We have found that separate subsidiary requirements for enhanced services impose inefficiencies and
other costs, and that discrimination and cross-subsidization can be policed adequately through less onerous means.
No party has shown that provision of video-related enhanced services, which at this time do not include video programming
itself, is so fundamentally different from provision of other enhanced services as to require a different regulatory
regime. We do, however, make one minor change to our nonstructural safeguards. Currently, the BOCs and GTE must file
nondiscrimination reports on their installation and maintenance of 49 categories of basic services. To adapt this
requirement to video dialtone, we require the BOCs and GTE to add an additional service category for video dialtone
delivery service. We note that the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit recently vacated in part and
remanded the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
BOC Safeguards Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
on the ground that the Commission had not adequately explained how, without full unbundling of BOC networks under
ONA, discrimination could be prevented in the absence of structural safeguards. We delegate to the Common Carrier
Bureau authority to establish interim measures to govern BOC provision of enhanced services, including video dialtone-related
enhanced services, if and when this decision becomes effective.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
81. Finally, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
we stated that we would review our video dialtone rules and policies in 1995. Such review no longer appears to be necessary
in light of the detailed examination we have undertaken in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Memorandum Opinion and Order on Reconsideration 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
of those rules and policies, as well as our continuing work on major video dialtone issues through the CPNI data request
and the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Third Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Indeed, we are concerned that the regulatory uncertainty that could stem from another comprehensive review of video
dialtone rules and policies could discourage video dialtone deployment pending that review. For these reasons,
we will not initiate a formal review of our video dialtone rules and policies in 1995. Nevertheless, we will continue
to monitor the evolution of video dialtone and oversee its implementation in specific applications through the Section
214 process and the tariff review process. In addition, if in the future it becomes apparent that we should modify aspects
of our video dialtone rules and policies, we will initiate a proceeding to do so.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
J. Joint Marketing and Customer Proprietary Network Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
82. We affirm our decision to permit LECs to engage in joint marketing of basic and enhanced video dialtone services,
as well as of basic video and nonvideo services. We also affirm our decision to apply existing CPNI rules to video dialtone
at this time. Nevertheless, we direct the BOCs and GTE, the carriers to which our CPNI rules currently apply, to provide
us with additional information about the kinds of CPNI to which they will have access as a result of providing video
dialtone service so that we may obtain a better record in assessing whether existing CPNI rules best balance the various
interests that are implicated by the use of CPNI in the video dialtone context.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
83. We permit LECs to engage in joint marketing of basic and enhanced video services, and of basic video and nonvideo
services, because we believe that the benefits of permitting joint marketing outweigh any adverse effect on competition.
Joint marketing can offer consumers the convenience of one-stop shopping both for basic telephone and video dialtone
services and for basic and enhanced video dialtone services. Through joint marketing, LECs will be able to increase
customer awareness not only of the video dialtone system generally, but of enhanced features and functions available
on that system. This awareness will benefit programmer-customers as well as end users and result in greater usage
of the video dialtone platform. At the same time, LECs will be able to market video dialtone services in the most efficient
manner possible, avoiding the costs imposed by structural separation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
84. The record in this proceeding does not support a finding that joint marketing of video and telephony services will
have an anticompetitive impact on the provision of video programming services to end users. While consumers moving
to a new residence typically arrange for telephone service prior to or immediately after the move, they also will be
arranging for other services at that time, including video programming services. No one has shown that the first call
placed is necessarily to the telephone company. More significantly, the cable operator, not the telephone company,
will be the incumbent video programming provider in the market. We believe that consumers today are likely to be aware
that they may order video programming services from the local cable operator. We also believe that they will do so if
the cable operator's rates and programming are preferable to those offered by programmers on the video dialtone network.
Simply because telephone companies may sometimes have an initial contact with consumers changing residences in
our view does not demonstrate a likely anticompetitive effect or warrant a prohibition on joint marketing. We also
note that the extent to which LECs will market basic video dialtone service to end users is unclear, particularly since
in some video dialtone applications, LECs have proposed to charge their programmer-customers, but not end users,
for basic video dialtone service. Moreover, since telephone companies, as common carriers, are prohibited from
favoring a particular video programmer's product, the ability of LECs to market video dialtone services to consumers
will be constrained in any event. By contrast, cable companies with authorization to provide telephone service can
jointly market video and telephony services without restrictions on favoring particular video programmers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
85. We also apply to video dialtone, at this time, our existing CPNI rules, which were recently upheld by the United
States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
California 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
v. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FCC. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No party has provided evidence that existing CPNI rules do not properly balance our CPNI goals relating to privacy,
efficiency, and competitive equity in the video dialtone context. Nevertheless, because of the significant privacy
issues that are potentially implicated by video dialtone-related CPNI, we believe we should obtain additional information
about such CPNI so that we may carefully assess whether existing CPNI rules sufficiently protect customer privacy
in the video dialtone context. For example, we seek information as to whether LECs, in providing video dialtone, will
have access to information about the types of programming that each customer views. This information would raise
greater privacy concerns than other CPNI, which does not generally include information about the content of customer
communications. We are also interested in assessing the competitive value of CPNI obtained from video dialtone,
as well as the extent to which access to this information promotes the efficient provision of regulated and nonregulated
services by LECs.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
86. In order to obtain a better record for addressing these issues, we direct each of the BOCs and GTE to file, within

, a detailed description of the types of CPNI to which it anticipates having access as a provider of video dialtone service.
We also direct each to explain how it would plan to use such information in marketing video dialtone services to video
programmers or consumers. Other interested parties, including, but not limited to, independent LECs, may also file
at that time any information responsive to these issues. After this information is filed, we will issue a public notice
establishing a supplemental pleading cycle that will give all interested parties the opportunity to comment. Based
on this record, we will then reassess whether the public interest would be served by modifying existing CPNI rules
for video dialtone service and propose any changes in those rules that may be warranted.

K. Preferential Access to Video Dialtone
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
87. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
we decided not to mandate preferential treatment for certain classes of video programmers largely because we concluded
that mandatory preferential treatment is generally inconsistent with a Title II common carrier regime, the cornerstone
of which is the provision of service to the public on the basis of rates, terms, and conditions that are not unreasonably
discriminatory. We still have concerns about this issue. A system of discounts or free access for certain video programmers
could also introduce economic distortions that would restrict demand for video dialtone service. For these and other
legal and policy reasons, mandating preferential rates for any specific class of programmer may not be compatible
with the public interest. On the other hand, however, the continued availability of diverse sources of programming
clearly serves the public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
88. We have recognized exceptions to the general principle of nondiscrimination in the provision of common carrier
services. These exceptions have been based upon a compelling showing of need and strong public policy concerns. Based
on our review of the record, we conclude that we do not currently have a sound basis for determining whether a similar
exception should be made here, and if so, for which programmers, and to what extent. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Third Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we seek comment on these issues. We also seek comment on whether a proposal by Bell Atlantic that seeks to permit LECs

L. Special Incentives
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
89. The petitioners have not presented any persuasive basis for the Commission to modify its decision in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 regarding special incentives. In particular, they have not persuaded us that our existing practices for prescribing
depreciation rates pose an impediment to the deployment of new technologies. Under our existing rules, the Commission
reviews the depreciation rates of each carrier on a three year rotating cycle. Carriers may also seek interim updates
of their depreciation rates. Based on a review of a variety of service life indicators, the Commission establishes
depreciation rates for each major category of plant designed to recover the carrier's investment over the plant's
projected remaining life. In the case of telephone plant, based on the most recent (1993) depreciation represcription
order, the average remaining life is 9 years and approximately 40 percent of the original cost of those facilities
has already been taken as depreciation expense. We believe that our existing practices are adequate to respond to
any acceleration in the rate of technological change in the provision of loop facilities. We also note that to date
we have received more than thirty video dialtone applications proposing use of advanced broadband networks. These
applications provide evidence that the measures we have taken in this proceeding to eliminate artificial regulatory
constraints will by themselves promote investment in broadband networks and that special incentives are unnecessary.

M. Recommendation to Congress
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
90. Although petitions for reconsideration do not lie against reports to Congress, we nevertheless take this opportunity
to affirm our recommendation that Congress amend the 1984 Cable Act to permit LECs to provide video programming directly
to subscribers in their telephone service areas, subject to appropriate safeguards. As we noted in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the 1984 Cable Act's ban on LEC provision of video programming was originally enacted to prevent LECs from establishing
a monopoly position in the provision of video services. Given the enormous growth of the cable industry during the
past decade, the risk of telephone companies preemptively eliminating competition in the video marketplace has
lessened significantly. While there remains some risk of anticompetitive behavior by the LECs, we affirm our finding
that this risk can and should instead be addressed through our video dialtone framework and other appropriate regulatory
safeguards.

Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Statement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
91. Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612, the Commission considered whether
this decision could disadvantage small non-vertically integrated cable systems, wireless cable systems, and broadcasters
because it could supplant these video distribution mechanisms. The Commission also considered whether this decision
could threaten small businesses involved in the video rental market by eliminating the current video distribution
chain. On the basis of the record, however, the Commission determined that the public interest in a competitive video
marketplace, increased opportunities for development of an advanced infrastructure and the promotion of a diversity
of video services, would be best served by permitting local telephone companies to offer video dialtone.

and options, shall not be included in the determination of cognizable ownership interests unless and until conversion
is affected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Attribution of ownership interests in a video programmer that are held indirectly by any party, other than an investment
company, through one or more intervening entities, will be determined by successive multiplication of the ownership
percentages for each link in the vertical ownership chain, and application of the relevant benchmark to the resulting
product, except that wherever the ownership percentage for any link in the chain exceeds 50%, it shall not be included
for purposes of this multiplication. (For example, if A owns 10% of company X, which owns 60% of company Y, which owns
25% of a video programmer, then X's interest in the video programmer would be 25% (the same as Y's interest since X's
interest in Y exceeds 50%), and A's interest in the video programmer would be 2.5% (0.1 &times; 0.25)). Under the 5%
attribution benchmark, X's interest in video programmer would be cognizable, while A's interest would not be cognizable.
Paragraph (e)(2) of this section governs stock ownership interests held by an investment company in a corporation.

(f) Nothing in this section prohibits a telephone company from providing video programming directly to subscribers
outside its telephone service area or from owning video programming that an unaffiliated video programmer directly
provides to subscribers in the telephone company's service area.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) As used in this section, the term ``video programmer'' shall mean any entity that provides video programming either
directly or indirectly through an affiliate, directly to subscribers. Any entity shall be deemed to ``provide''
video programming if it determines how video programming is presented for sale to subscribers, including making
decisions concerning the bundling or ``tiering,'' or the price, terms, or conditions on which video programming
is offered to subscribers.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA), is the agency within the DOT that has been delegated with
the responsibility of developing and promulgating regulatory requirements for the transportation of hazardous
materials. The RSPA has issued regulations which identify, define, describe and classify hazardous materials.
These requirements are codified, generally, in the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR) at 49 CFR Parts 171 through
180. The responsibility for enforcement of certain aspects of the HMR is delegated to the appropriate modal Administration,
and for highways, this responsibility rests with the FHWA. The FHWA consistently incorporates hazardous materials
terminology, descriptions, and classifications that are promulgated by the RSPA into the FMCSR, as appropriate,
in order to maintain uniformity between the requirements of the HMR and the requirements of the FMCSR.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The RSPA published a final rule on December 21, 1990 (55 FR 52402), entitled Performance-Oriented Packaging Standards;
Changes to Classification, Hazard Communication, Packaging and Handling Requirements, Based on United Nations'
Standards and Agency Initiative. This rule comprehensively amended the hazardous materials communication requirements
in the HMR, based upon the United Nations' Recommendations on the Transportation of Dangerous Goods, which are codified
at 49 CFR Part 107 through 180. Descriptions of certain hazardous materials currently found in Parts 387, 391, 392,
and 397 are incompatible with the RSPA's final rule which incorporated certain aspects of the United Nations' Recommendations
on the Transportation of Dangerous Goods, into the HMR, now codified at 49 CFR Parts 171&hyph;180. Hazardous materials
such as explosives, poison gases, and radioactive materials heretofore have been classified in the FMCSR using the
descriptive language and regulatory requirements of Parts 171 through 177 of the HMR, that were in effect prior to
the implementation of the United Nations' Recommendations. Therefore, in order to effectively carry out its responsibility
for enforcement of certain parts of the HMR, the FHWA has initiated these technical amendments to the FMCSR to provide
for regulatory consistency and uniformity.

Minimum Levels of Financial Responsibility for Motor Carriers, 49 CFR Part 387, was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on June 11, 1981 (46 FR 30974&hyph;30987). This part set forth requirements for motor carriers transporting non-hazardous
property, and/or hazardous materials or substances, to maintain minimum levels of financial responsibility. The
levels of financial responsibility vary, depending upon whether the cargo being transported is a non-hazardous
material, or a hazardous material.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Qualifications of drivers, 49 CFR Part 391, was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 22, 1970 (35 FR 6460). The requirements in this part establish minimum qualification standards for drivers
who drive motor vehicles as, or for a motor carrier engaged in interstate commerce. This part includes limited exceptions
for drivers who are otherwise qualified and regularly employed, and were hired before July 1, 1975. A driver is not
subject to the requirements of this part if the driver continues regular employment, is transporting certain material
considered to be hazardous, and transports that hazardous material in

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 25, 1968 (33 FR 19732). Among other things, this part requires drivers who drive a motor vehicle to stop
at all railroad grade crossings, and to utilize, in lieu of flame producing devices, emergency reflective triangles
or other such devices, when transporting certain types of hazardous materials.

Transportation of Hazardous Materials; Driving and Parking Rules, 49 CFR Part 397, was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 13, 1971 (36 FR 4876). This part requires motor carriers to have in place various procedures, policies, and
documents during the transportation of hazardous materials by motor vehicle. Part 397 classified hazardous materials
using the descriptive language and regulatory requirements of the HMR. These classifications, in place since 1971,
included explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizing materials, and gases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA is making appropriate conforming changes to 49 CFR Parts 387, 391, 392, and 397 of the FMCSR, that reference
any hazardous material classification or description, based upon the United Nations' Recommendations, the RSPA's
adoption of changes to the HMR reflective of these recommendations, and the need for international uniformity of
these regulations. In addition, the FHWA is appropriately making nomenclature changes in 49 CFR Part 387 of the FMCSR,
to indicate that all references made to the ``Bureau of Motor Carrier Safety'', will now read, the ``Federal Highway
Administration.'' All text references in Part 387 referencing the ``Bureau'' will read the ``FHWA.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Schedule of Limits chart as it appears in section 387.9 is being amended by removing the ``Note'' directly beneath
the chart, and replacing it with specific gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) references within the content of the
chart itself. Since first promulgated, the ``Note'' reference has been confusing. By inserting specific weight
limits into the text of the ``Type of Carriage'' column, the applicability of the financial responsibility requirements
is more understandable. This final rule also removes a second Schedule of Limits chart, currently in section 387.15,
because the information it contains is duplicative of that in the chart found in &sect;387.9.

553(b)(3)(B). As previously discussed, on December 21, 1990 (55 FR 52402), the RSPA comprehensively revised the
regulatory requirements of the HMR with respect to hazard communication, classification, and packaging requirements.
The revisions adopted the United Nations' Recommendations on the Transportation of Dangerous Goods, and were intended
to further international regulatory uniformity. This FHWA final rule changes terminology and descriptions used
in the FMCSR to reflect the changes made by the RSPA to the HMR. These amendments are technical in nature, and do not alter
any current requirements regarding hazardous materials. Accordingly, the FHWA has determined that prior notice
to the public on this action is unnecessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, prior notice and opportunity for public comment on this document are not required under the Department
of Transportation's Regulatory Policies and Procedures because it is not anticipated that such action will result
in the receipt of useful information. This action promotes uniformity in the regulatory terminology and descriptions
contained in the HMR and the FMCSR.

12866, or a significant regulation as defined under DOT regulatory policies and procedures. These amendments are
being made without substantive change to the existing regulatory language of these parts, and are strictly technical
in nature. Provided in the amendments is a listing of the new hazardous materials classifications and descriptions
by their respective classes and divisions as they pertain to minimum levels of financial responsibility, qualifications
of drivers, driving of motor vehicles, and driving and parking requirements. It is anticipated that the economic
impact of this regulatory action will be minimal. Therefore, a full regulatory evaluation is not required.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is exempting from regulation the transportation by rail of grease or inedible tallow, etc. (STCC No.
20&hyph;143). These commodities are added to the list of exempt commodities in 49 CFR part 1039, as set forth below.
This exemption does not embrace exemptions from regulation of car hire and car service.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 21, 1993, at 58 FR 54320, we requested comments on a proposal by the Association of American Railroads (AAR)
to exempt from regulation the railroad transportation of grease or inedible tallow. The comments have been received
and analyzed. We are approving AAR's proposal.

 NMFS, by emergency interim rule, amends the regulations implementing the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management
Plan (FMP). This emergency rule implements a simultaneous closure of redefined Closed Area I, the Nantucket Lightship
Closed Area, and Closed Area II; a prohibition on scallop vessels in the closed areas; a disallowance of any fishery
utilizing mesh smaller than the minimum mesh size allowed for regulated species, with the exception of fisheries
that have been determined to have a catch of less than 5 percent by weight of regulated species; a prohibition on the
possession of regulated species while fishing with small mesh; a requirement that all mobile gear vessels fishing
in the Stellwagen Bank and Jeffreys Ledge areas, with the exception of mid-water trawl vessels, use 6-inch (15.24-cm)
square mesh codends; and an increase in the minimum mesh size in the Southern New England and Nantucket Lightship Regulated
Mesh Areas to 6-inch (15.24-cm) diamond or square mesh.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The New England Fishery Management Council (Council) submitted Amendment 5 to the FMP to NMFS on September 27, 1993.
The Amendment contained provisions that the Council believed would eliminate the overfished condition of cod, yellowtail
flounder, and haddock. Amendment 5 was approved by NMFS on January 3, 1994. Most measures were implemented on March
1, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Meanwhile, NMFS issued an emergency rule, which was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 3, 1994 (59 FR 26) and effective from January 3, 1994, through April 2, 1994, to protect the seriously depleted
stocks of haddock. The emergency rule established a 500 lb (226.8 kg) possession limit for haddock; began the closure
of an expanded Closed Area II on January 3, 1994, rather than February 1, 1994; and implemented several other measures
to protect haddock. The final rule implementing Amendment 5 on March 1, 1994, permanently put into place several measures
that were contained in the emergency rule. Other measures in the emergency rule that were not contained in the proposed
rule for Amendment 5 were continued in effect by the final rule, and would have expired on April 2, 1994, as provided
by the emergency rule, but for its extension through further rulemaking, effective through June 30, 1994. The final
rule for Amendment 6 to the FMP (59 FR 32134, June 22, 1994) was made effective beginning June 30, 1994, and continued
on a permanent basis three measures originally imposed by the January 3, 1994, emergency rule to protect depleted
haddock stocks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendment 5 allows for regulatory adjustments through the framework abbreviated rulemaking procedure codified
in 50 CFR part 651, subpart C. Although four frameworks have been implemented (Frameworks 1, 3, 4, and 6), only Framework
3 and Framework 6 pertain directly to increased protection of multispecies. Framework Adjustment 3 (59 FR 36725,
July 19, 1994) limited the amount of regulated species allowed on board vessels fishing with small mesh to either 500
lb (226.8 kg) or 10 percent of the weight of non-regulated species, whichever is less. Framework Adjustment 6 (59 FR
47815, September 19, 1994) increased the minimum mesh size from 21/2 inches (6.35 cm) to 3 inches (7.62 cm) in the Cultivator
Shoal whiting (silver hake) fishery. Two other framework adjustments, Framework Adjustment 2 and Framework Adjustment
5, were withdrawn and put on hold, respectively.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Following the Council's August 9&hyph;10, 1994, meeting, the Northeast Regional Stock Assessment Workshop (SAW)
issued to the Council an unprecedented Special Advisory on Groundfish Status on Georges Bank along with its 18th Stock
Assessment Report (SAW 18). The Advisory Report concluded that yellowtail flounder and haddock stocks have ``collapsed''
and warned that the cod stock is in imminent danger of collapse, as well, unless the sharply declining trend in spawning
stock biomass is halted. Hence the report advised that, for Georges Bank cod and yellowtail flounder, current fishing
mortality rates would need to be reduced by 60 percent and 52 percent, respectively, just to achieve the maintenance
level (i.e., the point at which stocks will cease, on average, to decline). The report advised that in order to avert
a collapse of cod and improve the prospects of stock rebuilding for yellowtail, fishing mortality should be reduced
to as low a level as possible, approaching zero. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For Georges Bank cod, SAW 18 concluded that the fishing mortality rate increased from 0.3 in 1978 to a record high of
0.91 in 1993, well over twice the definition of the overfishing level specified in the FMP. The spawning stock biomass
continued to decline from more than 90,000 metric tons (mt) during the early 1980s to a record low of 37,200 mt in 1993.
Projections for 1994 indicate that the spawning stock biomass will decline further to record low levels around 19,000
mt and that the landings for 1994 will be the lowest since the 1960s. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SAW 18 results on the status of Georges Bank yellowtail flounder concluded that fishing mortality rates are about
twice the overfishing level as defined in the FMP. Further, the spawning stock biomass of 3,010 mt in 1993 has declined
from a moderate level of 17,385 mt in 1982 and from an earlier high of 25,000 mt in 1973. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similar grave reports came out of the last assessment for the Southern New England yellowtail flounder stock (Stock
Assessment Workshop 17 (SAW 17)). Fishing mortality rates for this stock have been extremely high, reaching exploitation
rates greater than 80 percent in recent years. In 1992, the exploitation rate was 84 percent, far exceeding the 35 percent
exploitation rate associated with the overfishing definition. Spawning stock biomass declined 94 percent between
1989 and 1992, from 22,000 mt to 1,300 mt as the 1987 year class was removed from the spawning stock. Further, spawning
stock biomass for 1993 has been projected to decline to 1,052 mt because year classes following the 1987 year class
are weak. Recruitment in the last several years has been the lowest on record. Landings and spawning stock biomass
for 1994 are projected to be less than 1,000 and 2,500 mt respectively, both well below average. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The most recent assessment of haddock (Stock Assessment Workshop 13 (SAW 13)) indicated that haddock spawning stock
biomass on Georges Bank has been reduced from 130,000 mt in 1963 to an estimated 10,000 mt at the beginning of 1993, significantly
lower than the 130,000 mt required to provide an annual maximum sustainable yield of 47,000 mt. The haddock stocks
on Georges Bank and the Gulf of Maine are at all-time low levels of abundance, and the 1993 landings were the lowest in
recorded history. Amendment 6 to the FMP and its Environmental Assessment/Regulatory Impact Review addressed the
need for immediate action to protect these stocks. The conservation measures for haddock implemented under Amendment
6 have likely reduced fishing mortality and have afforded some protection to the spawning stock and to new recruits.
The stock is still in a collapsed condition, but the harvest rate is probably below the level at which the stock is simply
maintained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendment 5 was intended to eliminate overfishing of the primary multispecies stocks through incremental effort-reduction,
mesh-size increase, and expanding spawning area closures, among other measures, over a 5- to 7-year period. When
the Council adopted objectives for Amendment 5 more than 3 years ago, cod, haddock, and yellowtail flounder stocks
were being fished at a rate that was, on average, twice what could be sustained over the long term, so a plan was designed
to reduce fishing by half. However, during the development and implementation period of Amendment 5, fishing mortality
rates increased and the downward trends in stock size and yields continued to accelerate. Given the new information
presented at SAW 18, the recently imposed management measures in Amendment 5 are inadequate and will not achieve the
reductions in fishing mortality rates needed to rebuild the multispecies stocks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to these new, alarming assessments and advice, the Council has begun the development of an FMP amendment
(Amendment 7) to implement the recommendations of SAWs 17 and 18 for severely depleted multispecies stocks, including
Georges Bank yellowtail flounder, Southern New England yellowtail flounder, haddock, Georges Bank cod, and others,
as needed. To this effect, a notice of intent to prepare a supplemental environmental impact statement for Amendment
7 and a request for comments was published in the

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the development of Amendment 7 is moving forward quickly, it will likely take several months for it to be completed
and implemented, if approved. However, because the primary multispecies stocks have reached dangerously low levels,
the Council and NMFS believe it is imperative that fishing effort on these stocks be curtailed as much as practicable
on an immediate basis. The Council and NMFS are also concerned about displaced effort resulting from vessels re-directing
their effort from Georges Bank multispecies stocks into other areas outside of Georges Bank and into other fisheries,
creating ever more competition for fewer and fewer fish. Further, more and more vessels probably will be displaced
into the small-mesh fisheries where there is sometimes a high rate of juvenile and legal-size multispecies bycatch.
Given this concern, on October 27, 1994, the Council voted to recommend that the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary)
take emergency action to implement immediate protective measures to slow the stock decline as much as practicable
and to address the consequent effort displacement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to the very serious condition of the multispecies stocks and the need to begin addressing this crisis, NMFS believes
that emergency action is warranted. These emergency measures build upon the existing provisions of Amendment 5 and
are in no way a panacea for the multispecies fishery crises at hand. They are a set of initial measures addressing the
immediate interim need to begin the process of curtailing fishing pressure on these stocks and addressing vessel
displacement. The measures were selected among other options because they are relatively less controversial, as
evidenced by the near unanimous support of the Council; the measures and the scope of their impacts can be relatively
easily defined, given the emergency nature of this action and the need for a quick response, and the short timeframe
available to implement emergency actions; and they are more narrowly focused and therefore more easily administered.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS has, therefore, determined it necessary to implement the following measures in the multispecies fishery as
an emergency action. The first measure closes Area I (as defined in the Council's proposed FAAS 7), Area II, and the
Nantucket Lightship Closed Area immediately and simultaneously. Because these areas all have historically high
concentrations of various multispecies, closing them will help slow the decline of the stocks through a reduction
in fishing mortality. Also, Area II is being closed earlier than currently required, and simultaneously with Area
I and the Nantucket Lightship Area in order to protect against any effort displacement from one area to another while
this measure is in effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second measure prohibits scallop vessels from the closed areas. Scallopers have been known to catch significant
amounts of yellowtail flounder, as well as other multispecies. There have also been reports that scallop dredge gear
disturbs the bottom and disrupts spawning activity; therefore, this measure will also help rebuild multispecies
stocks in these areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third measure disallows any fishery utilizing mesh smaller than the minimum mesh size for regulated species,
except for fisheries that have been determined to have a catch of less than 5 percent by weight of regulated species,
and prohibits the possession of regulated species while fishing with small mesh. Current regulations limit possession
of regulated species by vessels fishing with small mesh nets to the lesser of 10 percent of the total catch or 500 lb (226.8
kg). The Council is concerned about reports that this measure is being abused, resulting in increased mortality of
juvenile multispecies stocks. Furthermore, recent anecdotal information indicates that there has been some perceivable
recruitment in the Gulf of Maine haddock stock. This action will protect juvenile haddock, which if caught in a small-mesh
fishery would have to be discarded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because fishing effort will likely shift to small-mesh fisheries as the result of this emergency action, prohibiting
the possession of regulated species in all areas while fishing with small mesh will remove any incentive to target
multispecies stocks. The Council proposed that no fishery using small-mesh nets ``be allowed that has not been verified
to have a catch of less than five percent by weight of regulated species.&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*'' The Regional
Director has determined that the purse seine and midwater trawl fisheries in all areas, the shrimp fishery in the Gulf
of Maine/Georges Bank regulated mesh area, the sea scallop net fishery in the Mid-Atlantic regulated mesh area, and
the butterfish, dogfish, herring, Atlantic mackerel, ocean pout, scup, shrimp, squid, summer flounder, whiting,
and weakfish fisheries in the Southern New England and Mid-Atlantic regulated mesh areas meet this requirement.
The Regional Director may close these or other fisheries, based on a determination that the catch of regulated species
is 5 percent or more by weight, or may exempt a closed fishery, based on a determination that the catch of regulated species
is less than 5 percent by weight. Any such closure or exemption will be done through publication of a rule in the

The fourth measure requires all mobile gear vessels fishing in the Stellwagen Bank and Jeffreys Ledge areas, with
the exception of midwater trawl vessels, to use 6-inch (15.24-cm) square-mesh codends. This restriction is already
in place under Amendment 5 during the period March 1 through July 31, and applies to the last 140 bars of the codend and
extension piece. To address several recent concerns raised by the fishing industry_namely, small boats do not have
nets as long as 140 bars_the Council voted to adjust this requirement such that vessels greater than 45 ft (13.7 m) must
have 100 bars of square mesh in the codend and extension piece, and vessels 45 ft (13.7 m) and under must have 50 bars of
square mesh in the codend and extension piece. Although this adjustment to the current FMP has not been submitted to
NMFS, it is the clear intent of the Council and is, therefore, reflected in this emergency action. Because square mesh
allows for better escapement of juvenile cod as well as other roundfish, this measure is being extended to protect
this known productive fishing grounds; also, due to the area's close proximity to shore, this measure will serve as
a protection against effort displacement. Further, protection is particularly warranted in light of recent research
surveys by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts indicating the possibility that the 1993 year class of cod is better
than expected in this general area. These new recruits will be very vulnerable to fishing in 1995 and this action has
a high potential of protecting them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fifth and final measure requires that the minimum mesh size in southern New England, east of 72
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;30
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; W. lat., be set at 6-inch (15.24-cm) diamond or square, consistent with the mesh-size requirement in the Gulf
of Maine and Georges Bank areas. Increasing the minimum diamond mesh size will increase the escapement of cod and other
roundfish, thereby providing additional protection for juvenile and sub-legal fish. Vessels fishing near the boundary
of the current Georges Bank Regulated Mesh Area will be required to use the same mesh as those fishing inside the area.
Also, this measure will help protect an important component of the Georges Bank cod stock that migrates through the
Nantucket Shoals area and waters south of Martha's Vineyard during the winter.

NMFS has determined that this rule is necessary to respond to an emergency situation and is consistent with the Magnuson
Act and other applicable law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, also finds for good cause that the reasons justifying promulgation
of this rule on an emergency basis also make it impracticable and contrary to the public interest to provide additional
notice and opportunity for public comment, or to delay for 30 days the effective date of these emergency regulations,
under the provisions of sections 553(b) and (d) of the Administrative Procedure Act. All of the measures have received
some public comment during Council meetings and in connection with the development of Amendment 5 or proposed Amendment
7 to the FMP. Implementation of these emergency measures will provide much- needed immediate interim protection
to declining multispecies stocks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This emergency rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule is exempt from the procedures of the Regulatory Flexibility Act to prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis
because the rule is issued without opportunity for prior public comment. No analysis has been prepared.

. A vessel must have a properly configured and installed finfish excluder device in any net with mesh smaller than the
minimum size specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this section. The finfish excluder device must be configured and installed
consistent with the following specifications (see Figure 2 to part 651) for an example of a properly configured and
installed finfish excluder device): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) A finfish excluder device is a rigid or semi-rigid grate consisting of parallel bars of not more than 1-inch (2.54-cm)
spacing that excludes all fish and other objects, except those that are small enough to pass between its bars into the
codend of the trawl. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The finfish excluder device must be secured in the trawl, forward of the codend, in such a manner that it precludes
the passage of fish or other objects into the codend without the fish or objects having first passed between the bars
of the grate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) A fish outlet or hole must be provided to allow fish or other objects that are too large to pass between the bars of
the grate to pass out of the net. The aftermost edge of this outlet must be at least as wide as the grate at the point of attachment.
The fish outlet must extend forward from the grate toward the mouth of the net. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) A funnel of net material is allowed in the lengthening piece of the net forward of the grate to direct catch towards
the grate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A vessel may only fish for or harvest northern shrimp during the northern shrimp season, as established by the
Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC). The northern shrimp season is December 1 through May 30, or
as modified by the ASMFC.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Army announces a revision and consolidation of 32 CFR Parts 536, Claims Against the United States
and 537, Claims on Behalf of the United States in order to bring them in line with new policies and procedures being promulgated
in Army Regulation 27&hyph;20, Claims. This revision retains part 536 as The Army Claims System. Part 537 is removed
and held in reserve for future use. This part prescribes the policies, procedures, and responsibilities for investigating,
processing, and settling claims against and in favor of the United States under the authority conferred by certain
statutes, regulations, international and interdepartmental agreements, and Department of Defense directives.
It is intended to ensure that claims are properly investigated, adjudicated objectively and fairly, and either paid
or collection action initiated. Because of the complexity and length of changes and consolidation of parts 536 and
537, a breakout of the scope or responsibilities of each subpart to this whole part is listed in the Supplementary Information
part of this submission. By reviewing the supplementary information portion, reading of the complete part becomes
necessary in order to understand the entire part.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The following may be designated as area claims offices: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Copies of delegations within claims processing offices will be provided to the area claims office and, if so directed,
to command claims services.

Operations of claims components.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Command claims services. A command claims service will be supervised by the SJA of the command. If the command claims
service is a separate organization, the command SJA will designate a JA as the chief of the service. Otherwise, the
SJA will be the chief of the service. Adequate, qualified claims personnel will be assigned to ensure that claims are
promptly investigated and acted upon. With the concurrence of the service may designate area claims offices within
its area of operations to carry out claims responsibilities within specified geographic areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Area claims offices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The area claims office is the principal office for the investigation and adjudication or settlement of claims,
and will be staffed with qualified legal personnel under the supervision of the SJA or command JA or Corps of Engineer
district or command legal counsel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The full-time responsibility for claims investigations and processing in a portion of the area or for claims related
to the activities of a unit or organization within the area may be delegated to another command, unit, or activity by
the establishment of a claims processing office at the command, unit or authority. (See &sect;536.7(d)(4) and (e).)
Normally, all claims processing offices will operate under the supervision of the area claims office in whose area
the claims processing office is located. Where a proposed claims processing office is not under the command of the
parent organization of the area claims office, this designation may be effected by a support agreement or memorandum
of understanding between the affected commands.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Normally, claims that cannot be settled by an engineer area claims office will be forwarded directly to the Commander,
USARCS with notice to the Chief Counsel, COE of such referral. However, the Chief Counsel, as part of his or her responsibility
for litigation of suits involving civil works and military construction activities, may require that an engineer
area claims office forward claims through engineer channels provided that such requirement does not preclude final
action by Commander, USARCS within the time limitations set forth in subparts D and H.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Claims processing offices. For a subpart K, if the adjudicated amount of a claim is in excess of the monetary jurisdiction
of the head of the claims processing authority, the claim will be approved and paid up to the delegated authority of
that office and immediately forwarded to the next higher claims authority for additional payment. (See &sect;536.161(e)).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Claims processing offices without approval authority. A claims processing office that has not been granted claims
approval authority will provide for the investigation of all potential and actual claims arising within its assigned
jurisdiction, either on an area basis or on a command or agency basis. Once the investigation is completed, the claims
file will be forwarded to the appropriate area claims office for action. Alternatively, an area claims office may
direct that a claims investigation made by a claims processing office without approval authority be forwarded to
another claims processing office within the area that has approval authority if the claim is within the jurisdiction
of the latter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Claims processing office with approval authority. A claims processing office that has been granted approval
authority must provide for the investigation of all potential and actual claims arising within its assigned jurisdiction,
either on an area basis or on a command or agency basis, and for the adjudication and payment of all presented claims
within its monetary jurisdiction. If the estimated value of a claim, after investigation, is beyond the payment authority
of the claims processing office or if disapproval is the appropriate action, the claim file will be forwarded to the
area claims office unless otherwise specified in this part, or forwarded to USARCS or the command claims service,
as appropriate, if directed by such service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Medical claims processing offices. The medical claims JAs at Army medical centers, other than Fitzsimons Army
Medical Center and Walter Reed Army Medical Center, may be designated by the SJA/head of area claims office for the
installation on which the center is located as claims processing offices with approval authority for medical malpractice
claims only. Claims beyond their approval authority will be investigated and forwarded to the Commander, USARCS.
The SJA, Health Services Command, Quality Assurance Division, OTSG (DASG&hyph;PSQ) and the Consultation Case Review
Branch, Clinical Policy and Consultants Division, Office of the Surgeon General (CCRB), will be advised by USARCS
of all referrals, provided a copy of all claims, and informed of their disposition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Special claims processing offices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The Commander, USARCS, the chief of a command claims service or the head of an area claims office may designate special
claims processing offices within his or her command for specific, short-term purposes (for example, maneuvers,
civil disturbances, and emergencies). These special claims processing offices may be delegated approval authority
necessary to effect the purpose of their creation, but in no case will this delegation exceed the approval authority
maximums set forth in other subparts of this part for regular claims processing offices. All claims will be processed
under the claims expenditure allowance and claims command and office code of the authority who established the office
or a code assigned by USARCS. The existence of any special claims processing office must be reported to the Commander,
USARCS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A special claims processing office is the proper organization to process and approve, as appropriate, maneuver
damage claims, except where a foreign government is responsible for adjudication under an international agreement
(see subpart G). Personnel from the maneuvering command should be used in the investigation of claims and, at the discretion
of the area claims office, may be assigned to the special claims processing office. Claims filed after the termination
of the maneuver will be processed by the area claims office. Claims arising within the jurisdiction of other area claims
offices, while units are traveling to or from the maneuver, will be investigated by the special claims processing
office and forwarded for action to the area claims office in whose area the claims arose. Claims for damage to real or
personal property arising on private land being used under a permit may be paid from funds specifically budgeted by
the maneuver for such purposes in accordance with AR 405&hyph;15.

(iii) A special claims processing office provided for a disaster or civil disturbance should include a claims approving
authority with adequate investigatory, administrative, and logistical support, to include damage assessment
and finance and accounting support. It should not be dispatched prior to notification of Commander, USARCS. The concurrence
of Commander, USARCS must be obtained prior to the payment of the first claim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Claims processing offices discussed in paragraphs (c)(2) through (4) of this section must be supervised by an
assigned JA or claims attorney in order to exercise delegated approval authority.

Claims policies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) General. (1) Claims investigation and adjudication should be accomplished at the lowest level possible, that
is, by the claims processing office or area claims office with monetary authority over the estimated total value of
all claims arising from the incident in question. The expeditious investigation and settlement of claims is essential
to the successful fulfillment of the Army's responsibilities under the claims statutes implemented by this part.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Where technical errors exist in the filing of a claim or in its format, claimants should be advised of such errors
and the need for corrective action. If the errors concern a jurisdictional matter, advice should be given expeditiously
and a record should be maintained. The advice should include a warning that the error must be corrected prior to the
expiration of the statute of limitations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Investigative environment. In the investigation of claims, every effort should be made to create a cooperative
environment engendering the free exchange of information and evidence. The goal of obtaining sufficient information
to make an objective and fair analysis should be paramount. Personal contact with claimants or their representatives
is frequently essential to clarify the issues both during investigation and prior to adjudication. Where settlement
is not feasible, issues of disagreement or dispute should be clearly identified and spelled out to facilitate the
resolution of any reconsideration, appeal, or in appropriate cases, litigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Claims directives and plans. (1) Two copies of command claims directives will be furnished to the Commander, USARCS.
Area claims office directives will be distributed to all DA and DOD commands, installations, and activities within
the area of responsibility with an information copy to Commander, USARCS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) One copy of all area claims offices' disaster/civil disturbance plan or annex will be furnished to the Commander,
USARCS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Interpretations. The Commander, USARCS will publish written interpretations of the provisions of this part
and establish and publish policy as to those matters that are within agency discretion. Interpretations and policies
that reference this provision will have the same force and effect as this part.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Exceptions. If it is considered to be in the best interest of the Government, the Commander, USARCS may grant authority
to deviate from the specific requirements contained in this part in a particular instance except as to matters that
are based on statutes, treaties and international agreements, executive orders, controlling directives of the
Attorney General or Comptroller General, or otherwise have the force and effect of law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Guidance. The Commander, USARCS may publish bulletins, manuals, handbooks, notes, and a DA Pamphlet to provide
claims authorities with guidance on administrative and procedural matters related to the implementation of this
part. These will be binding on all Army claims personnel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Communication. All claims personnel are authorized to communicate directly with personnel of the USARCS for
guidance on matters of policy or relating to the implementation of this part.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Private relief bills. There is no established procedure under which DA sponsors private relief legislation;
this is a matter between an individual and his or her congressman. Claims personnel will remain neutral in private
relief matters. No statement should be made that purports to reflect a DA position on a private relief bill.

Guidance concerning disclosure of information and assistance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Conflict of interest. Government personnel are forbidden to represent any claimant or to receive any payment
or gratuity for services rendered. They may not accept any share or interest in a claim or assist in its presentation,
under penalty of Federal criminal law (18 U.S.C. 203, and 205).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Release of information. (1) Government personnel are prohibited from disclosing information that may be the
basis of a claim or any evidence of record in any claims matter except as authorized by statutory or regulatory authority.
Certain documents which would normally be privileged or exempt from release, such as unclassified statements, documents
containing opinions, conclusions, or findings, may be released to a claimant or his or her attorney, wherever release
may help settle a claim or avoid unnecessary litigation, unless such release is barred by statute.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) All requests for records and information made pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) or the Privacy
Act (PA) will be processed in accordance with the procedures set forth in AR 25&hyph;55 or AR 340&hyph;21. Requests
submitted by a claimant or his or her attorney, which cite only the FOIA, will be processed under the time limits of the
FOIA and the exceptions and fees of the PA and FOIA, as required by AR 25&hyph;55, paragraph 1&hyph;512c. Except for
medical quality assurance records exempt from disclosure by 10 U.S.C. records protected by the Privacy Act of 1974,
records within a category for which withholding of the record is discretionary (AR 25&hyph;55, paragraph 3&hyph;101)
may be released to a claimant or his or her attorney, if no legitimate purpose exists for withholding it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) When it is determined that exempt information should not be released, the request will be forwarded to USARCS.
For requests processed only under the FOIA, the commander, USARCS, may deny release of the records, acting on behalf
of TJAG, the initial denial authority. The commander, USARCS will forward to TJAG all requests processed under the
FOIA and PA. TJAG is the initial denial authority for PA requests (AR 340&hyph;21, paragraph 1&hyph;7i).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Claims assistance. The foregoing prohibitions do not apply to information and assistance provided in the performance
of official duty. Any person who indicates a desire to file a claim against the United States cognizable under one of
the subparts of this part will be instructed concerning the procedure to follow. The claimant will be furnished claim
forms and, when necessary, will be assisted in completing claim forms and assembling evidence. He or she will not be
assisted in determining what amount to claim. In the vicinity of a field exercise, maneuver, or disaster, information
may be disseminated concerning the right to present claims, the procedure to be followed, and the names and location
of claims officers and engineer repair teams. When the government of a foreign country in which U.S. Armed Forces are
stationed has assumed responsibility for the settlement of certain claims against the United States, officials
of that country will be furnished pertinent information and evidence so far as security considerations permit.

(4) Except when they arise in countries for which single-service responsibility is assigned in paragraphs (b)(1),
(2), and (3) of this section, single-service claims responsibility for claims involving, or generated by the U.S.
Central Command or units assigned or attached thereto, is assigned to the Department of the Air Force. The addresses
of United States sending State offices and single-service offices are contained in DA Pam 27&hyph;162, figure 
<!-- PJG 0320 forcenewline -->
7&hyph;1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) When claims responsibility has not been assigned. On an interim basis prior to receiving confirmation and approval
from the appropriate office in DOD, the appropriate unified commander may, when necessary to implement contingency
plans, assign single-service responsibility for processing claims in countries where such assignment has not already
been made.

(a) Where another military department has single-service claims responsibility. Claims, claims by and against
the United States resulting from Army activities or caused by members or employees of the DA in a country where another
department has been assigned single-service claims responsibility will be investigated by the Army and referred
to that department for settlement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Where claims responsibility has not been assigned. Claims, claims cognizable under the FCA or the MCA generated
by another military department in a foreign country where single-service claims responsibility has not been assigned
may, upon request of the department concerned, be settled by the Army. Conversely, Army claims may, in appropriate
cases, be referred to another department for settlement.

Importance of the claims investigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because evidence developed during an investigation provides the basis for every subsequent step in the administrative
settlement of a claim or the defense of a lawsuit, a prompt and thorough investigation will be conducted on all potential
and actual claims for or against the government. Adverse as well as favorable information must be collected and recorded
and the legal and factual findings of the claims JA/attorney must be preserved in the format specified in &sect;536.22.

Reasons for investigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The investigation is performed to ascertain the facts of an incident. Which facts are relevant will often depend
on the law and regulations applicable to the conduct of the parties involved, but as general guidance, the investigation
should develop definitive answers to such questions as ``When,'' ``Where,'' ``Who,'' ``What,'' and ``How.'' Generally,
the time, place, persons, and circumstances involved in an incident may be established by a simple report, but the
cause and the resulting damage may require extensive effort to obtain all the pertinent facts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The object of the investigation is to gather, with the least possible delay, the best available evidence without
accumulating excessive evidence concerning any particular fact. The claimant is often an excellent source of such
information and should be contacted early in the investigation. The investigative file should include medical records,
witness interviews, photographs, and expert opinions.

Immediate investigation requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Immediate investigation of an incident is required when_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Property other than Government property is damaged, lost, or destroyed. Damage resulting directly or indirectly
from combat need only be investigated to the extent necessary to confirm that the combat exclusion of the appropriate
statute is applicable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Government property is damaged, lost, or destroyed under circumstances that may give rise to a claim in favor of
the Government under subpart N.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The incident results in injury to or death of, any civilian other than to a civilian of the Army while in performance
of duty an employee of the United States or its instrumentalities while acting within the scope of their employment.
For deaths or injuries resulting directly or indirectly from combat activities of our forces, the investigation
merely has to develop sufficient information to verify that the combat exception of the appropriate claims statute
is applicable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A claim is made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Investigation is requested by another armed service of the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) A member of the uniformed services, a dependent, or any other person who is eligible for medical care at Army medical
treatment facilities is injured under circumstances that permit recovery of the cost of hospital and medical care
under subpart N.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) An incident occurs in CONUS involving foreign nationals who are members of a foreign military force or civilian
components of parties to the Agreement Regarding the Status of Forces of Parties to the North Atlantic Treaty, resulting
in personal injury, death, or property damage (subpart G).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) A patient, other than potential claimants excluded by &sect;536.51(j), &sect;536.75(r) through (t) and &sect;536.95,
while under treatment by the Army Medical Service, dies, is injured, or otherwise disabled physically, mentally,
or emotionally due to_

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(ii) Care that does not meet standards for non-Government facilities similar to the Army facility providing the care;
or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) An incident that could give rise to a claim against the United States under this part; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Competent authority so directs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Investigation by a claims officer is required when the situation or consequences described in paragraphs (a)
(1) through (4), and (a)(9) of this section arise from activities of the ARNG or its personnel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Claims arising out of situations that may be expected to generate a substantial number of claims in a short period
of time and are properly cognizable for settlement under this regulation (such as maneuvers or other special operations,
emergencies, civil disturbances, aircraft and missile accidents, or disasters) will be investigated in accordance
with procedures set forth herein by the claims office responsible for the area in which the incident occurred. No claim
arising out of such an emergency situation will be paid until the concurrence of the Commander, USARCS has been obtained.
(See &sect;536.8(c)(4)(iii)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Where an accident occurs that could only result in a claim against the United States that is not payable because
of the incident to service rule, for example, barred by the Feres Doctrine, or the Federal Employees' Compensation
Act (FECA), or the Longshoremen's and Harborworkers Compensation Act (LHWCA), the investigation may be limited
to that necessary to make such a determination. However, claims officials will ensure that the appropriate commander
or organization safety office is aware of the incident so that measures to avoid a recurrence can be pursued.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;536.16
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->
Unit claims officers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Commanders' responsibility. Commanders and heads of DA and DOD components whose personnel, equipment or operations
are involved in an incident giving rise to a potential or actual claim for or against the government (see &sect;536.15(a)),
will appoint a commissioned officer, a warrant officer or a qualified civilian employee to conduct an initial factual
investigation of the incident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Installation commanders, brigade commanders, commanders of separate battalions, state ARNG Adjutant Generals
and other commanders whose operations may generate a significant number of claims should consider appointing a claims
officer on standing orders to facilitate training and coordination with the claims JA/attorney supporting the unit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Senior noncommissioned officers (E6 thru E9) may be appointed as assistant claims officers to perform duties
under the supervision of a claims officer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Claims officer appointment orders should designate the claims JA/attorney who supports the unit as the claims
officer's legal advisor. The orders will direct the claims officer to seek guidance from the claims JA/attorney at
the outset of the investigation and before completion of the investigation whenever the potential value of the claim
is in excess of $15,000 or an actual claim in excess of that amount has been filed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The scope and duration of the investigation will depend on the severity and complexity of the incident and may range
from merely obtaining investigation reports already prepared by police and other investigators to a formal investigation
by a board of officers under the provisions of chapter 5, AR 15&hyph;6. In addition to the provisions of this chapter,
claims officers will follow the guidance in Chapter 5, DA PAM 27&hyph;162 and the advice of the claims JA/attorney
listed as their advisor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Unit claims officers, in addition to making a report of investigation as specified in &sect;536.16(b), will account
for and preserve all available evidence for use in future litigation. Evidence will be retained until released by
the claims JA/attorney. Therefore, the claims officer will consult with the claims JA/attorney before disposal,
destruction or repair of damaged property or other evidence. The claims officer will also act as the claims JA/attorney's
point of contact for support and assistance from the unit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Claims officers must coordinate their work with concurrent criminal and safety investigations, which have priority
within DA for access to accident sites and witnesses (see paragraph 1&hyph;4d, AR 15&hyph;6 and paragraphs 4&hyph;8a(2),
5&hyph;1a(1) and 5&hyph;4 AR 385&hyph;40). To the greatest extent possible claims officers should take advantage
of the work already done on these other investigations (see &sect;536.19 of this part). Although there are limits
on the information safety personnel can release to claims officers, some of the information in safety reports can
be released (see paragraphs 1&hyph;10 and 5&hyph;6, AR 385&hyph;40).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Report of claims officer. (1) Format. The claims officer will prepare a written report of investigation on DA Form
1208 (Report of Claims Officer), except that no recommendation on disposition of prospective claims will be entered
in block 11. Where a formal investigation is conducted in accordance with the procedures in chapter 5, AR 15&hyph;6,
the report may be submitted on DA Form 1574 (Report of Proceedings by Investigating Officer/Board of Officers). If
the claims officer does not feel either form is appropriate, the claims JA/attorney advising the claims officer will
be consulted for guidance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Processing. The report should normally be completed and submitted to the appointing authority within 60 days
of the accident/incident. If a final report will not be completed within that time one or more interim reports may be
required by the commander or claims JA/attorney. The appointing authority will either return the report for further
investigation or, if satisfied that it is as complete as possible given the information available, forward one copy
of the report to the appropriate claims office with or without comment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Content. The report will contain findings of fact concerning the incident, to include the circumstances leading
to the incident (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
training and experience of Army personnel involved) and the resulting property damage and/or injuries. These findings
should be based on the evidence reasonably available within the time available for completion of the report. See chapter
5, DA PAM 27&hyph;162 for guidance on the information needed in the most common types of claims incidents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Limits on findings. The unit claims officers will not make findings concerning questions of liability or attempt
to assess a dollar value on personal injuries. The findings should merely state the facts (who, what, where, when,
and how). While a clear and complete statement of the facts will often make it clear who is responsible for the damage
or injury, the determination of legal liability and the appropriate amount of compensation is the responsibility
of the claims JA/attorney or the courts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Use and release of information. The report of this initial investigation may be used in conjunction with any administrative
or legal action within DOD, such as line of duty investigations, reports of surveys, disciplinary actions under the
Uniform Code of Military Justice or civilian personnel regulations, contract actions, or the collateral investigation
of an Army accident required by paragraph 1&hyph;7c, AR 385&hyph;40. It may also be used by the commander or the unit's
safety officers as the basis for their safety report (DA Forms 285 and 285&hyph;1) when a centralized accident investigation
or separate safety investigation is not conducted. It may be released to the public, to law enforcement personnel,
state and federal regulatory agencies and other non-DOD entities subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information
Act and the Privacy Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Disposition of reports. The claims processing office or area claims office having jurisdiction over the type
of claim involved will retain the claims officer's report until a claim is received or until six months after the time
for filing a claim is past. If no claim is filed within the statutory limit, the report will be disposed of as an organizational
record in accordance with AR 25&hyph;400&hyph;2.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If an incident occurs, or a claim is filed, in a foreign country where no appropriate commander is located, investigative
assistance may be sought from the Defense Attache or the Military Assistance and Advisory Group (MAAG). Incidents
involving Attache or MAAG personnel, and claims arising from their activities, will be investigated in accordance
with DIAM 100&hyph;1B, volume 1, section T, chapter 1, or AR 175, chapter 6, as appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Under the provisions of DODD 5515.9 the Commander, USARCS, or designee, may request assistance from DOD components
whose personnel are involved in incidents generating claims in the investigation of such claims, and may appoint
DOD personnel as claims officers for the purpose of conducting such investigations.

Claims office responsibility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The claims JA/attorney receiving notice of an incident requiring investigation will immediately refer it to
the appropriate claims officer and will notify, the Commander, USARCS of all major incidents involving serious injury
of death, or where non Federal property damage exceeds $25,000. In some cases the claims JA/attorney assigned to the
case may decide that a unit claims officer investigation is not necessary and waive the requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The heads of area claims offices and the chiefs of command claims services are responsible for ensuring that a prompt
and thorough claims investigation is conducted of all claims for or against the Army arising in their area before they
take or recommend final action on a claim. The investigation of incidents and claims arising out of the activities
of the Corps of Engineers (COE) is the responsibility of the appropriate COE district or division Counsel. On claims
in excess of $25,000, the claims JA/attorney assigned to the case should consult with the action officer at USARCS
on the extent of the investigation (see &sect;536.21).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The initial investigation by the unit claims officer is supposed to be completed promptly after the accident and
may not be sufficient for final resolution of the claim. The unit's investigation will often be completed before a
formal claim is filed and before all information about the full extent of the damages is available. An interview of
the claimant may not have been possible or advisable. New information submitted with the claim may require further
investigation. The more extensive investigation usually required for final action on a claim will often require
the use of not just unit claims officers but also claims JA's/attorneys and investigators within the area claims office,
experts within and from outside DOD and personnel from USARCS.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Transfer of responsibility is authorized when the investigation may be more practicably conducted or completed
by the claims officer of another installation or unit. When two or more commands are involved, the common superior
commander or the Commander, USARCS will decide who will conduct the investigation. The commanding officer whose
personnel or equipment is involved will furnish to the authority responsible for conducting the investigation all
available information concerning the incident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Transfer will be accomplished by direct transmittal of a report of the incident in writing, with all available
evidence (or orally, later confirmed in writing).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) When more than one Federal agency is or may be involved, the claims office receiving the claim will contact, at the
field level, all other affected agencies in order to obtain the designation of a single agency to investigate and determine
the merits of the claim. If such a designation cannot be agreed upon, USARCS will be notified in order to attempt to resolve
the matter at agency level or to request the Department of Justice to make a designation. If the DA is the designated
agency, the claimant will be notified to correspond only with the DA. This is not to be construed to preclude assistance
in the investigation from other Federal agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) If a claim is received that arises solely out of the activities of another Federal agency, the claim will be transferred
to such agency and the claimant notified of such transfer. If the appropriate agency cannot be identified, the claim
will be returned to the claimant informing him or her of this fact.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) When an incident occurs where the Army has no unit or installation conveniently located for conducting an investigation,
but another U.S. military department does have an installation or unit in the vicinity, the responsible officer may
request the commanding officer or commander of any organization of another U.S. military department to conduct or
assist in the investigation. Similar requests from another military department will be honored if possible.

(a) General. A claims investigator will be guided by policies, procedures, and guidance set forth in DA Pam 27&hyph;162
or furnished by the Commander, USARCS. For other than routine incidents, guidance should be obtained from the claims
approval or settlement authority who will have jurisdiction based on the probable value of the largest single claim
arising from the incident. The extent and nature of the investigation should be guided by the specific requirement
of the situation. If it is considered in the best interest of the Government, the Commander, USARCS, or the chief of
a command claims service, may grant authority to deviate from the specific requirements contained in this part in
a particular investigation, except as to procedures that are based on statute or have the force of law.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) Information from other investigations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The investigator should obtain a copy of the report of any prior investigation that was made for purposes other
than claims; for example_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Police reports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Line of duty reports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) AR 15&hyph;6 investigations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Reports of survey.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) IG investigations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Safety investigations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) Government contractor investigations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) Investigations by other governmental agencies such as National Transportation Safety Board; Food and Drug
Administration; Center for Disease Control; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms; and Consumer Product Safety
Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) While such an investigation may not be adequate for claims and litigation purposes, it may contain evidence and
leads of value to the investigator. If the report of the prior investigation contains diagrams, photographs, or witness
statements, it is not necessary for the investigator to cover the same ground. Copies of such items may be made and included
in the claims investigation. Generally, however, it will be necessary for the investigator to obtain more complete
statements from witnesses. This is especially true for statements in medical quality assurance reports and reports
of Army accidents prepared by Army safety personnel, as there are regulatory restrictions on the use of these statements
in connection with claims and litigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) When military records fail to confirm the occurrence of a traffic accident upon which a claim is based, or substantial
doubt arises regarding the nature or extent of the actual damages or injuries allegedly sustained, claims authorities
should contact the Bureau of Motor Vehicles of the appropriate State or municipality to ascertain whether an accident
report of the incident is a matter of record and, if so, a copy of such report should be obtained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Statements of witnesses. Perhaps the most important phase of an investigation is the securing of statements from
available witnesses, including the claimant and persons associated with him or her, for example, persons riding
in the vehicle. The claims investigator may take the unsworn statements of a witness or may, if the statement is satisfactory
for claims purposes, use a statement secured by another investigator.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Photographs and diagrams. Claims investigators should have cameras and obtain photographs and diagrams to describe
the scene of incidents that they investigate. Photographs and drawings should indicate when taken or made and by whom.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Claims requiring information of a specialized nature. Depending on the nature of the incident, the investigator
must decide on the specialized nature of evidence that will be required. In this regard, reference should be made to
DA Pam 27&hyph;162 wherein specific items of information and documentation required for various categories of incidents
are listed. Sufficient documentation of property losses or damages and personal injury or death should be obtained.
Technical advice and assistance will be furnished by other DA agencies such as the Tank and Automotive Command or the
Army Safety Center for vehicular accidents, or the Army Aviation Reserve Board and the Corpus Christi Army Depot for
aircraft accidents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Completion of investigation. Upon completion of the investigation, the investigator must carefully review
the report to ascertain whether all pertinent information has been included and inconsistencies reconciled. The
review should take into consideration the following questions: Is the report of investigation complete enough to
enable the approving authority to decide how the incident occurred? On whom does the responsibility for the incident
rest? What is the extent of any loss or damage suffered? In the ordinary case, if the investigator has included in the
report all information pertaining to the ``what,'' ``who,'' ``where,'' ``when,'' and ``how'' of the occurrence,
the information needed by those who must decide the claim will be satisfied.

(a) Who may present. (1) A claim may be presented by the owner of the property, or in the owner's name by a duly authorized
agent or legal representative. As used in this regulation an owner includes the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) For real property. The mortgagor, or the mortgagee, if he or she can maintain a cause of action in the local courts
involving a tort to that specific property. When notice of divided interests in real property is received, the claim
should, if feasible, be treated as a single claim or a release from all interests must be obtained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) For personal property. A bailee, leasee, mortgagee, and conditional vendor, or others having title for purposes
of security only, are not proper claimants unless specifically authorized in the subpart in question. If more than
one party has an interest in the property, all must join in the claim or a release from all interests must be obtained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A claim for personal injury may be presented by the injured person or by a duly authorized agent or legal representative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A claim based on death may be presented by the executor or administrator of the deceased's estate, or by any person
determined to be legally or beneficially entitled. The amount allowed will, to the extent practicable, be apportioned
among the beneficiaries in accordance with the law applicable to the incident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A claim for medical, hospital, or burial expenses may be presented by any person who by reason of family relationship
has, in fact, incurred the expenses for which the claim is made. For claims cognizable under the provisions of the FTCA,
see subpart D. (See &sect;536.86 for restrictions on damages allowable in claims involving death or personal injury
under the Act of 9 October 1962 (10 U.S.C. 2737).)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) A claim presented by an agent or legal representative will be made in the name of the claimant and signed by the agent
or legal representative showing his or her title or capacity. Where a claim is presented by an agent or legal representative_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Written evidence of the authority of the agent or legal representative to act, such as a power of attorney, is required,
or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Where the authority is conferred by State statute, a citation to that statute is required. (See DA Pam 27&hyph;162,
appendix H, section I, paragraph 14&hyph;2; see also &sect;536.21 for additional requirements relating to settlements.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) A claim normally will include all damages that accrue by reason of the incident. Where the same claimant has both
a claim for damage to or loss of property and a claim for personal injury or claim based on death arising out of the same
incident, each of the foregoing or any combination of them ordinarily represent only an integral part of a single claim
or cause of action. Under subparts C through J of this part, a single claimant is entitled to be compensated only one
time for all damages or injuries arising out of an incident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Subrogation. A claim may be presented by the subrogee in his or her own name if authorized by the law of the place where
the incident giving rise to the claim occurred, provided subrogation is not barred by the portion of this part applicable
to the type of claim involved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The claims of the subrogor (insured) and subrogee (insurer) for damages arising out of the same incident constitute
separate claims and it is permissible for the aggregate of such claims to exceed the monetary jurisdiction of the approving
or settlement authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A subrogor and a subrogee may file a claim jointly or individually. A fully subrogated claim will be paid only to
the subrogee. Whether a claim is fully subrogated is a matter to be determined by local law. Some jurisdictions permit
the property owner to file for property damage even though he or she has been compensated for the repairs by his or her
insurer. In such instances a release should be obtained from both parties in interest or be released by both of them.
The approved payment in a joint claim will be by joint check that will be sent to the subrogee unless both parties specify
otherwise. If separate claims are filed, payment will be by check issued to each claimant to the extent of his or her
undisputed interest.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) Where a claimant has made an election and accepted workmen's compensation benefits, both statutory and case law
of the jurisdiction should be scrutinized to determine to what extent the claim of the injured party against third
parties has been extinguished by acceptance of compensation benefits. While it is infrequent that the claim is fully
extinguished and where it is not, the only proper party claimant is the workmen's compensation carrier. Even where
the injured party's claim has not been fully extinguished, most jurisdictions provide that the compensation insurance
carrier has a lien on any recovery from the third party and no settlement should be reached without approval by the carrier
where required by local law (19 American Law Reports (ALR) 766, supplemented by 27 ALR 493, 37 ALR 838, 67 ALR 249, 88
ALR 665, and 106 ALR 1040). Also, claims from the workmen's compensation carrier as subrogee or otherwise will not
be considered payable where the United
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
States has paid the premiums, directly or indirectly for the workmen's compensation insurance. Applicable contract
provisions holding the United States harmless should be used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) Whether medical payments paid by an insurer to its insured can be subrogated depends on local law. Some jurisdictions
prohibit these claims to be submitted by the insurer notwithstanding a contractual provision providing for subrogation.
Therefore, local law should be researched prior to deciding the issue, and claims forwarded to higher headquarters
for adjudication should contain the results of said research. Such claims, where prohibited by State law, will also
be barred by the Antiassignment Act. (See paragraph (c) of this section).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Care will be exercised to require insurance disclosure consistent with the type of incident generating the claim.
Every claimant will, as a part of the claim, make a written disclosure concerning insurance coverage as to_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The name and address of every insurer;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The kind and amount of insurance;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Policy number;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Whether a claim has been or will be presented to an insurer, and if so, the amount of such claim; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Whether the insurer has paid the claim in whole or has indicated payment will be made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Each subrogee must substantiate his or her interest or right to file a claim by appropriate documentary evidence
and should support the claim as to liability and measure of damages in the same manner as required of any other claimant.
Documentary evidence of payment to subrogor does not constitute evidence either of liability of the Government or
of the amount of damages. Approving and settlement authorities will make independent determinations upon the evidence
of record and the law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) Subrogated claims are not cognizable under subparts E, J or K.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Transfer and assignments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Except as they occur by operation of law or after a voucher for the payment has been issued, unless within the exceptions
set forth by statute (31 U.S.C. 3727 and AR 37&hyph;107), the following are null and void:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Every purported transfer or assignment of a claim against the United States, or of any part of or interest in a claim,
whether absolute or conditional.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Every power of attorney or other purported authority to receive payment of all or part of any such claim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The purposes of the Antiassignment Act are to eliminate multiple payment of claims, to cause the United States
to deal only with original parties, and to prevent persons of influence from purchasing claims against the United
States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In general, this statute prohibits voluntary assignments of claims with the exception of transfers or assignments
made by operation of law. The operation of law exception has been held to apply to claims passing to assignees because
of bankruptcy proceedings, assignments for the benefit of creditors, corporate liquidations, consolidations
or reorganizations, and where title passes by operation of law to heirs or legatees. Subrogated claims that arise
under a statute are not barred by the Antiassignment Act. For example, subrogated workmen's compensation claims
are cognizable when presented by the insurer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Subrogated claims that arise pursuant to contractual provisions may be paid to the subrogee if the subrogated
claim is recognized by State statute or decision. For example, an insurer under an automobile insurance policy becomes
subrogated to the rights of a claimant upon payment of a property damage claim. Generally, such subrogated claims
are authorized by State law and are therefore not barred by the Antiassignment Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Before claims are paid, it is necessary to determine whether there may be a valid subrogated claim under Federal
or State statute or subrogation contract held valid by State law. If there may be a valid subrogated claim forthcoming,
payment should be withheld for this portion of the claim. If it is determined that claimant is the only proper party,
full settlement is authorized.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Action by claimant. (1) Form of claim. (i) The claimant will submit his or her claim using authorized official forms
whenever practicable. A claim is filed only when the vital elements (see Appendix B to this part) have been supplied
in writing by a person authorized to present a claim (paragraph (a) of this section) unless the claim is cognizable
under a subpart that specifies otherwise.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A claim may be amended by the claimant at any time prior to final agency action or prior to the exercise of the claimant's
option under 28 U.S.C. 2675(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Signatures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The claim and all other papers should be signed in ink by the claimant or his or her duly authorized agent. Such signatures
will include the first name, middle initial, and surname. A married woman should sign her claim in her given name; for
example, ``Mary A. Doe.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Where the claimant is represented, the supporting evidence required by paragraph (a)(5) of this section will
be required only if the claim is signed by the agent or legal representative. However, in all cases in which a claimant
is represented, the name and address of the representative will be included in the file together with copies of all
correspondence and records of conversations and other contacts maintained and included in the file. Frequently,
these records are determinative as to whether the statute of limitations has been tolled.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Presentation. The claim must be presented to the commanding officer of the unit involved; the legal office of the
nearest Army post, camp, or station; or other military establishment convenient to the claimant. In a foreign country
where no appropriate commander is stationed, the claim may be submitted to any attache of the U.S. Armed Forces. (See
AR 1&hyph;75.) Claims arising overseas which are cognizable under Article VIII of the Agreement Regarding the Status
of Forces of Parties to the North Atlantic Treaty, Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security Between the United States
of America and Japan Regarding Facilities and Areas and the Status of United States Armed Forces in Japan or other similar
treaty or agreement are filed with designated claims officials of the receiving State.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Evidence to be submitted by claimant. The claimant should submit the evidence necessary to substantiate his or
her claim. It is essential that independent evidence be submitted that will substantiate the correctness of the amount
claimed.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(f) Statute of limitations. (1) General. Each statute available to the DA for the administrative settlement of claims,
except the Maritime Claims Settlement Act (10 U.S.C. 4802), specifies the time during which the right to file a claim
must be exercised. These statutes of limitations, which are jurisdictional in nature, are not subject to waiver unless
the statute expressly provides for waiver. Specific information concerning the period for filing under each statute
is contained in the appropriate implementing subpart of this part.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When a claim accrues. A claim accrues on the date on which the alleged wrongful act or omission results in an actionable
injury or damage to the claimant or his or her decedent. Exceptions to this general rule may exist where the claimant
does not know of the injury or damage, or does not know the cause of injury or damage. In those cases, the claim accrues
when the injured party, or someone acting on his or her behalf, knows or should know about both the existence and cause
of the injury. However, this exception does not apply when, at a later time, he or she discovers that the acts inflicting
the injury may constitute medical malpractice. (See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
United States 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

v. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Kubrick, 444 U.S. 111, 100 S. Ct. 352 (1979).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) The discovery rule is not limited to medical malpractice claims; it has been applied to diverse situations involving
violent death, chemical and atomic testing, and erosion and hazardous work environment. In claims for indemnity
or contribution against the United States, the accrual date is the time of payment for which indemnity is sought or
on which contribution is based.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Effect of infancy, incompetency, or the filing of suit. The statute of limitations for administrative claims
is not tolled by infancy or incompetency. Likewise, the statute of limitations is not tolled for purposes of filing
an administrative claim by filing of a suit based upon the same incident in a Federal, State, or local court against
the United States or other parties. (For the effect of filing an administrative claim with an agency other than the
Army, see &sect;536.53(b), &sect;536.77(b) and (c) and 536.102)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Amendment of claims. A claim may be amended by the claimant at any time prior to final agency action or prior to the
exercise of the claimant's option under 28 U.S.C. 2675(a). A claim may be amended by changing the amount, the bases
of liability, or elements of damages concerning the same incident. Parties may be added only if the additional party
could have filed a joint claim initially in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. If the additional party had a separate
cause of action, his or her claim may not be treated as an amendment but only as a separate claim and is thus barred if the
statute of limitations has run. For example, if a claim is timely filed on behalf of a minor for personal injuries, a
subsequent claim by a parent for loss of services is considered a separate claim and is barred if it is not filed prior
to the running of the statute of limitations. Another example is where a separate claim is filed for loss of services
or consortium by a spouse arising out of injuries to the husband or wife of the claimant. On the other hand, if a claim
is timely filed by an insured for the deductible portion of his or her property damage, a subsequent claim by the insurer
based on payment of property damage to its insured may be filed as an amendment even though the statute of limitations
has run, unless final action has been taken on the insured's claim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Date of receipt stops the running of the statute. In computing the time to determine whether the period of limitation
has expired, exclude the first day and include the last day, except when it falls on a nonworkday such as Saturday, Sunday,
or a legal holiday, in which case it is to be extended to the next workday.

Disposition of claims.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) General. When a claim is received, the date and the designation of the receiving command or office will be stamped
or otherwise noted on all copies. If the receiving command or office is not responsible for the investigation, the
claim will be transmitted to the claims office of the command or installation concerned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) By the command concerned. Following completion of the claims investigation, the command claims service or claims
office responsible for the claim may take the following actions on all claims other than those for which USARCS has
exclusive jurisdiction (see &sect;536.21(c)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If the claim is of a type and amount within the jurisdiction of the claims office of the command concerned and the
claim in meritorious in the amount claimed, it will be approved and paid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If a claim in an amount in excess of the monetary jurisdiction of the claims office is meritorious in a lesser amount
within its jurisdiction, the claim may be approved for payment provided the amount offered is accepted by the claimant
in settlement of the claim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the claim is not of a type within the jurisdiction of the claims office, or if the claimant will not accept an amount
within its jurisdiction, the claim with supporting papers and a recommendation for appropriate action will be forwarded
to the next higher claims authority. Any personnel claim forwarded to a higher authority for settlement will be accompanied
by a memorandum of opinion. Prior to forwarding any tort claim, the USARCS AAO must be consulted and a joint decision
reached on whether a memorandum of opinion must be submitted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If the claim is determined to be not meritorious, it will be disapproved provided the claims office has settlement
authority for claims of the type and amount involved. If the type and amount of the claim requires denial by higher authority,
the claim will be forwarded through claims channels to the appropriate authority accompanied by a claims memorandum
of opinion recommending denial. Prior to the disapproval of a claim under a particular statute, a careful review should
be made to ensure that the claim is not properly payable under a different statute or on another basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Claims within the exclusive jurisdiction of USARCS. Authority to settle the type of claims listed below has not
been delegated below USARCS. Command claim services or area claims offices receiving these types of claims will investigate
them in accordance with this regulation and guidance from USARCS. Regardless of the amount claimed, a mirror copy
of the claims will be sent to Tort Claims Division, USARCS immediately on receipt. Once the investigation is complete,
the files on these claims should be forwarded directly to USARCS and a memorandum of opinion recommending disposition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Claims arising in the United States out of the actions of members of the force or civilian component of a NATO nation
or headquarters (subpart G, statutory authority).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Maritime claims for or against the Army other than those arising overseas within the jurisdiction of a command
claims service or those within the jurisdiction of Corps of Engineers and other specially designated claims offices
(See subpart H).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Claims based on the denial of a security clearance by the government to civilian employee of defense contractors
(DODD 5220.6, section 10, paragraph C).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Claims by the U.S. Postal Service against the Military Postal Service Agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) In areas where the FTCA is applicable, any claim except those under subpart K, arising out of an accident involving
a POV driven by a member of the Army, or by ARNG personnel defined in subpart F, based on an allegation that the POV travel
was within the scope of employment. On these claims the memorandum of opinion will include a specific discussion on
the issue of scope of employment under applicable law (See chapters 4 and 5, AR 27&hyph;40).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Mirror file requirement. In addition to the claims listed in 536.21, USARCS is responsible for monitoring the
investigation and settling the following claims. A copy of these claims and of any claims listed in paragraph (c) of
this section, will be forwarded immediately on receipt to the Commander, USARCS, ATTN: JACS&hyph;TCD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A case that must be brought to the attention of the Department of Justice in accordance with The Attorney General's
Regulations (DA Pam 27&hyph;162, appendix H).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Any FTCA, MCA, or other tort claim in which the amount claimed exceeds $25,000.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) FTCA, MCA or other tort claims arising out of an incident if the combined amounts of the claims exceed $25,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A claim within the exclusive jurisdiction of USARCS (see paragraph (c) of this section). The field claims office
will provide USARCS duplicates of all correspondence, records and documents relevant to the investigation and processing
of the claim as they are added to the file. Direct liaison and correspondence between USARCS and the field claims authority
is authorized and encouraged on these and all claims. In addition, heads of area claims offices in CONUS will advise
the action officer at Tort Claims Division, USARCS who is responsible for their geographic area of all potential claims
likely to meet the criteria in this paragraph or in paragraph (c) of this section, and will forward a copy of the investigation
file to USARCS on request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) By higher settlement authority. A higher claims settlement authority may take action with respect to a claim in
the same manner as the initial claims office. However, if it is determined that any further attempt to settle the claim
would be unwarranted, the claim will be forwarded to the Commander, USARCS, with recommendations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Claims not cognizable under subparts C through L. If a claim is determined not to be cognizable under this regulation,
reference to DA Pam 27&hyph;162, chapter 8 may reveal a basis for compensation or consideration by another agency.
If so, the claimant will be so advised. If, after investigation, it appears that the claim may not be settled under any
law or regulation, the claim, the related file, and a memorandum of opinion will be forwarded through claim channels
to the Commander, USARCS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Blast damage claims. All claims cognizable under subparts C, D and F which are based on damage to or loss of property
due to explosions (for example, artillery firing, aerial bombing, or demolition of explosives) will be sent through
USARCS to U.S. Army Ballistic Research Laboratories (USABRL), Aberdeen Proving Grounds, MD 21005&hyph;5055, for
a technical opinion prior to settlement. See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, chapter 5, section IX.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Part I. Identifying data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Name, address, and social security number of all claimants/plaintiffs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Name, address, and telephone number of attorney.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Date and place of incident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Date and amount of claim/ad damnum of complaint.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Brief (one sentence) description of claim/case.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Actual or potential companion claims (nature and status).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Part II. Jurisdiction. Discuss applicable statute(s), whether the claim was timely and properly filed, and other
jurisdictional matters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Part III. Facts. Provide a complete statement of the facts upon which the claim and any defense thereto are predicated.
In each instance in which a fact is supported by documents or witness statements in the file, appropriate parenthetical
references will be inserted into the statement of facts. Subparagraphs with descriptive headings will be used if
appropriate, for example, background facts or facts about the incident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Part IV. Legal analysis. List issues related to liability and the controlling law with applicable citations.
Subparagraphs with descriptive headings will be used as appropriate and necessary, for example, law controlling
factual issues, factual bases for claim as related to issues (duty, proximate cause), defenses, existence of joint
tortfeasors. If the claim is barred by a jurisdictional defense, for example, Feres, Federal Employees Compensation
Act, statute of limitations, this matter will be discussed separately. The position on liability will be stated at
the end of the section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(5) Part V. Damages. Discuss the following in the order listed under appropriate subheadings as necessary: Who can
claim under applicable law, for example, wrongful death; description of injuries and treatment; description of
property loss and proof thereof; types of special damages (such as, loss of earnings, loss of services, past and future
care); type and nature of non-economic or general damages (use a summary in tabular form, as necessary, for special
and general damages); effect of diminished liability on the value of the claim; effect of subrogation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Part VI. Proposed settlement or action. Discuss any proposed structured settlement. Discuss any prior offers,
or negotiations and status. If a denial or final offer is indicated, so state.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Part VII. Recommendation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Part VIII. Document and witness list.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The witness list will include the name, SSAN, telephone number, and present and permanent address for each witness
or medical reviewer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Identify each document in the file.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(b) Personnel Claims memorandum. See &sect;536.168 for instructions on preparing a Personnel Claims memorandum.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Case abstract for malpractice claims. On all dental and medical malpractice claims, claims JAs will attach DD
Form 2526 (Case Abstract for Malpractice Claims) to all memoranda prepared under paragraph (a) of this section, and
forward to USARCS. Claims JAs will also submit this form to USARCS on all dental and medical malpractice claims settled
or denied within their local authority. When a claim is transferred to USARCS without a forwarding memorandum prepared
under paragraph (a) of this section, DD Form 2526 must still be completed and forwarded within 60 days after the medical
records are available for review by the MTF/DTF risk manager (RM).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Claims JAs/MCJAs will coordinate the completion of the form pertaining to the Standard of Care, Diagnoses, and
Procedures with the MTF/DTF RM or the RM's designee. If the RM does not provide this information, claims JAs/MCJAs
will note the reason and submit the form to USARCS. The sections pertaining to Provider Information and Type of Provider
and Specialty of DD Form 2526 will not be completed on the form submitted to USARCS. OTSG will task subordinate commands
to forward provider information on settled claims.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Claims JAs are required to submit one DD Form 2526 for each incident (course of treatment or nontreatment that results
in an injury) for which a claim has been filed. Derivative claims do not require a separate report. However, separate
reports are required when claimants allege physical injury to more than one claimant (for example, an infant's claim
for brain damage as a result of birth trauma and a mother's claim for physical injury caused by the delivery would require
two reports). When a claimant alleges negligent medical care at more than one MTF/DTF, USARCS will designate the claims
JA who will complete the DD Form 2526.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Subsequent action. It is not necessary for each claims authority who considers the claim to write a separate memorandum.
If a claims approval or settlement authority agrees with the memorandum of opinion written by another authority,
he or she can adopt the earlier memorandum by merely stating that he or she concurs in the adopted memorandum and stating
the nature of the action. If there is disagreement, in whole or in part, with the earlier memorandum, such disagreement
should be stated and reasons therefor set forth in a separate memorandum or in an addendum. The approval or settlement
authority will personally sign the action, indicating position title.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following actions may be taken as appropriate:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Transmittal of the claim to the appropriate claims office for proposed disposition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Disapproval of the claim provided the person signing the action is a settlement authority. (See appendix B to this
part).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Final offer. (See appendix B to this part).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Approval and certification of the claim for payment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) SF 1034 (Public Voucher for Purchases and Services Other Than Personal) will be used on all claims settled under
this part except claims settled under subpart D which will be paid utilizing an SF 1145 (Voucher for Payment Under the
Federal Tort Claims Act). (See &sect;536.35(a)(1) for exceptions.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When an SF 1034 is to be paid by the GAO, the certification block of the SF 1034 will not be signed by Army Officials.
GAO officials will certify any payment made by that agency. (See &sect;536.35(a)(1) for exceptions.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Payment of a claim under subpart D in excess of $2,500 is obtained by forwarding necessary documentation to the
GAO. Complete information on the requirements to effect such payments are set forth in &sect;536.35(b). Note that
the approval or settlement authority signs only the approval block (lower left) of the SF 1145 before submitting a
claim to the GAO for payment.

General considerations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Liability. In the adjudication of tort claims arising in the United States, the liability of the United States
generally is determined in accordance with the law of the state or country where the act or omission occurred, except
that any conflict between local law and an applicable United States statute will be resolved in favor of the latter.
However, in claims arising in foreign countries, liability may be based in whole or in part on local law or as otherwise
provided in subpart C for settlements of claims of United States inhabitants arising overseas under the Military
Claims Act. (See &sect;536.55(c).) Where liability is not clear or other issues exist, settlements should truly
reflect the uncertainties in the adjudication of such issues. Compromise settlements are encouraged provided agreement
can be reached that reflects the reduced value of the damages as measured against the full value or range of value if
such uncertainties or issues did not exist and were it possible for the claimant to successfully litigate the claim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Quantum exclusion. The costs of filing a claim and similar costs (for example, court costs, bail, interest, inconvenience
expenses, or costs of long distance telephone calls or transportation in connection with the preparation of a claim)
are not proper quantum elements and will not be allowed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Property damage. Property damage compensable under the tort claims provisions of this part means damage to tangible
real or personal property (see glossary). It does not include mere diminution of value of real property unless there
is some corresponding physical damage to the property, nor does it include damage to reputation, employment rights
or constitutional rights. Other remedies may be available for such injuries but they are generally not cognizable
under the FTCA, MCA, FCA or the Maritime Claims Settlement Act.

Incident to service exclusionary rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) General. A claim for personal injury or death of a member of the armed forces of the United States or a civilian employee
of the United States that accrued incident to his or her service is not payable under this part. A property damage claim
that accrued incident to the service of a member of the Armed Forces may be payable under 31 U.S.C. 3721 (subpart K) or
the MCA (subpart C), depending on the facts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Property damage claims. A claim for damage to or loss of personal property of a claimant who is within one of the categories
of proper party claimants listed in &sect;536.163, which is otherwise cognizable under &sect;536.164, must first
be considered thereunder. If a claim is not clearly compensable under subpart K, and it arises incident to a noncombat
activity of the DA or was caused by a negligent or wrongful act or omission of military personnel or civilian employees
of DOD, it may be cognizable under either the MCA or the FTCA. The claim, if meritorious in fact, will probably be payable
under one authorization or another regardless of whether the claim accrued incident to the service of the claimant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Personal injury and death claims. (1) Only after the death or personal injury has been determined to have not been
incurred incident to the member's service should subparts C and D be studied to determine which, if either, provides
a proper basis for settlement of the claim. In any event, the rule in

, 176 F.2d 482 (4th Cir. 1949) requiring setoff of amounts obtained though military or veterans' compensation systems
against amounts otherwise recoverable will be followed. Other Government benefits funded by general Treasury revenues,
not by the claimant's contributions, may also be used as a setoff against the settlement, for example,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 619 F.2d 1299 (8th Cir. 1980).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) As the incident to service issue is determinative as to whether this type of claim may be processed administratively,
the applicable law and facts should be carefully considered before deciding that injury or death was not incident
to service. Such claims also are often difficult to settle on the issue of quantum and thus more likely to end in litigation.
Moreover, the United States may well elect to defend the lawsuit on the basis of the incident to service exclusion and
this defense could be prejudiced by a contrary administrative determination that a service member's personal injuries
or death were not incident to service. Doubtful cases will be forwarded to the Commander, USARCS without action along
with sufficient factual information to permit a determination of the incident to service question.

Property damage appraisers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Appraisers will be used as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Appraisers should be used in all claims where an appraisal is reasonably necessary and useful in effectuating
the administrative settlement of the claim. Appraisals may not be economically feasible in some cases involving
property damage of less than $100 per item and the extent of damage may be determined by personal inspection and agreement
with the claimant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Where an appraisal is considered necessary, the claims officer and claimant should mutually agree, whenever
possible, upon a disinterested appraiser after determining the approximate cost of the appraisal. The method of
payment should be agreed upon in advance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If the claimant pays for the appraisal and can substantiate payment thereof by a paid bill or canceled check, such
cost is a reimbursable element of damage.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(ii) If the DA is absorbing the cost of the appraisal, payment is made from Appropriations, Operation and Maintenance,
Army (AR 37&hyph;108, paragraph 3&hyph;74).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If a single appraiser cannot be agreed upon, a joint appraisal can be conducted (that is one in which an appraiser
chosen by claimant and an appraiser chosen by the Government both examine the property and submit their respective
appraisals). Joint appraisals should be coordinated and monitored by the claims officer. The cost of a single or joint
appraisal should be commensurate with the amount of damage allegedly sustained and the fee charged by other appraisers
for similar work.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Appraisals by other organizations within the DA, the other Armed Services, or other Federal agencies may be used
in addition to or in lieu of independent appraisal when obtainable. Other organizations within DA may be called upon
to furnish such appraisals; for example, engineer districts will furnish an appraiser, if available, in regard to
damage to buildings or diminution in value of real property, provided the requesting office defrays travel expenses
for the individual's TDY.

Independent medical examinations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) In claims involving serious personal injuries, for example, cases in which there is an allegation of temporary
or permanent disability, the claimant should be examined by an independent physician, or other medical specialist,
depending upon the nature and extent of the injuries. The necessity for, and the cost of, the examination should be
commensurate with the severity of the injuries allegedly sustained and the fee charged by other examiners for similar
work. To preclude duplication of effort and expense, both claimant and the claims officer must agree, in advance,
upon the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The examiner chosen to conduct the examination and the location of the medical facility (whether governmental
or civilian).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) That the examiner's report constitutes the best evidence of the nature and extent of claimant's injuries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The method of paying for the examination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The necessity for conducting the medical examination must be approved by the claims office having monetary jurisdiction
over the largest claim or potential claim arising out of the incident. If a medical report is submitted in conjunction
with the filing of a claim, such report should be included in the file.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Payment of a civilian examiner's fee can be accomplished in either of the following two ways:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The claimant can incur the cost of the examination and submit a paid receipt or cancelled check, which constitutes
a reimbursable element of damage in evaluating the claim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The DA can absorb the cost of the examination (payment is made from Appropriations, Operation and Maintenance,
Army (AR 37&hyph;108, paragraph 3&hyph;74)) by the claims office having responsibility for investigating the claim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) As to an examination costing in excess of $750 or when local funds are exhausted, a request for funding may be directed
to Commander, USARCS with appropriate justification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) If the parties cannot agree upon an independent examiner, and if either the examiner chosen by the claimant or the
results of the examination are not acceptable, the Government may demand that the claimant be examined by an examiner
acceptable to the Government.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Examinations of claimants at Army medical treatment facilities are authorized by AR 40&hyph;3. Such examinations
may be used in addition to or in lieu of the foregoing where indicated.

The total award to which the claimant (and subrogees) may be entitled normally will be computed as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Determine the total of the loss or damage suffered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Deduct from the total loss or damage suffered any payment, compensation, or benefit the claimant has received
from the following sources:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The U.S. or ARNG employee/member who caused the damage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The U.S. or ARNG employee's/member's insurer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Any person or agency in a surety relationship with the U.S. employee; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Any joint tortfeasor or insurer, to include Government contractors under contracts or in jurisdictions where
it is permissible to obtain contribution or indemnity for the contractor in settlement of claims by contractor employees
and third parties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Any advance payment made pursuant to the section entitled ``advance payments'' of this subpart.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Any benefit or compensation based directly or indirectly on an employer-employee relationship with the United
States or Government contractor and received at the expense of the United States, including but not limited to medical
or hospital services, burial expenses, death gratuities, disability payment or pensions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The State (Commonwealth and so forth) whose employee or ARNG member (32 U.S.C. section 101(3)) caused or generated
an incident that was a proximate cause of the resulting damages.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Value of Federal medical care.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Benefits paid by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) that are intended to compensate the same elements of damage.
When the claimant is receiving money benefits from the VA under 38 U.S.C. 351 for a nonservice connected disability
or death based on the injury that is the subject of the claim, acceptance of a settlement or an award under the FTCA will
discontinue the VA monetary benefits until the amount that would have otherwise been received in VA monetary benefits
is equal to the total amount of the agreement or award including attorney fees. While monetary benefits received under
38 U.S.C. 351 must be discontinued as above, medical benefits, that is, VA medical care may continue provided the settlement
or award expressly provides for such continuance and the appropriate VA official is informed of such continuance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) When the claimant is receiving money benefits under 38 U.S.C. 410(b) for non-service connected death, arising
from the injury that is the subject of the claim, acceptance of a settlement or award under the FTCA or under any other
tort procedure will discontinue the VA benefits until the amount that would have otherwise been received in VA benefits
is equal to the amount of the total settlement or award including attorney fees. The discontinuation of monetary benefits
under 38 U.S.C. 410(b) has no effect on the receipt of other VA benefits. The claimant should be informed of the foregoing
prior to the conclusion of any settlement and thus afforded an opportunity to make appropriate adjustment in the amount
being negotiated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(11) The value of other Federal benefits to which the claimant did not contribute, or at least to the extent they are
funded from general revenue appropriations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(12) From collateral sources where permitted by State law (for example, State or Federal workers' compensation,
social security, private health, accident, and disability benefits paid as a result of injuries caused by a health
care provider).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) No deduction will be made for any payment the claimant has received by way of voluntary contributions, such as donations
of charitable organizations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Where a payment has been made to the claimant by his or her insurers or other surbrogee, or under workmen's compensation
insurance coverage if subrogated interests are allowable, the award based on total damages will be apportioned in
relation to their separate interests (&sect;536.20).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) After deduction of permissible collateral and noncollateral sources, also deduct that portion of the loss or
damage believed to have been caused by the negligence of the claimant, third parties whose negligence can be imputed
to the claimant, or joint tortfeasors who are liable for their share of the negligence (for example, where some form
of the Uniform Contribution Among Joint Tortfeasors Act has been passed).

Claims with more than one potential source of recovery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The Government seeks to avoid multiple recovery (that is, claimants seeking recovery from more than one potential
source) and to minimize the award it must make. The claims investigation should therefore identify other parties
potentially liable to the claimant and/or their insurance carriers; indicate the status of any claims made or include
a statement that none has been made so that it can be assured there is only one recovery and the Government does not pay
a disproportionate share. Where no claim has been made by the claimant against others potentially liable, if applicable
State law grants the Government the right to indemnity or contribution, and it is felt the Government may be entitled
to either under the facts developed by the claims investigation, the claims officer or attorney should formally notify
the other parties of their potentially liability, the Government's willingness to share information, and its expectation
of shared responsibility for any settlement. Furthermore, the claimant may be receiving or entitled to receive benefits
from collateral and non-collateral sources (&sect;536.28), which can be deducted from the total loss or damage.
Accordingly, a careful review must be made of applicable State laws regarding joint several liability, indemnity,
contribution, comparative negligence, and the collateral source doctrine.

(b) If a demand by a claimant or an inquiry by a potential claimant is directed solely to the Army, where it appears that
the responsible Army employee may have applicable insurance coverage, the employee should be queried as to whether
he or she has liability insurance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If so, determine if his or her insurer has made or will make any payment to claimant. Under applicable State laws,
the United States may also be an insured entitled to coverage under the employee's liability policy. (See

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The United States comes within the definition of ``insured''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The exclusion of the United States from policy coverage conforms with state laws and policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Appropriate consideration has been given for a policy where the United States has been excluded from coverage.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the employee refuses to cooperate in providing this information, he or she should be advised to comply with the
notice requirements of the insurance policy and to request the insurance carrier to contact the claims officer or
attorney. The case should be followed to ascertain whether the employee's insurer has made or will make any payment
to the claimant before deciding whether to settle the claim against the Government. Normally, the award, if any, to
the claimant will be reduced by the amount of the payment of the employee's insurance carrier. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If the employee is the sole target of the claim and Army claims authorities arrange to have the claim made against
the Government, the employee should be required to notify his or her insurance carrier according to the policy and
inform Army claims authorities of the name of the insurance carrier and details of the coverage. Except when the driver's
statute is applicable, the insurance carrier is expected to participate in the negotiation of the claims settlement
and to pay its fair share of any award to the claimant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Where the responsible Army employee is ``on loan'' to another employer other than the United States (for example,
an ROTC instructor at a civilian institution or performing duties for a foreign government), it should be determined
whether there is applicable statutory or insurance coverage concerning the acts of the responsible employee and
appropriate contribution or indemnification should be sought. In the case of foreign governments, applicable treaties
or agreements are controlling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) A great many claims cognizable under the FTCA are now settled on a compromise basis. A major consideration in many
such settlements is the identification of other sources of recovery. This is true in a variety of factual situations
where there is a potential joint tortfeasor; for example, multi-vehicle accidents with multiple drivers and guest
passengers, State or local government involvement, contractors performing non-routine tasks for the Government,
medical treatment rendered to claimants by non-Government employees, or incidents caused by a member or employee
of the military department of a State or Commonwealth with whom the DA does not have a cost-sharing agreement. The law
of the jurisdiction regarding joint and several liability, indemnity, and contribution may permit shared financial
responsibility, but even in jurisdictions that do not permit contribution, a compromise settlement can be reached
with the other tortfeasor's insurance company paying a portion of the total amount of the claim against the Government.
For these reasons, every effort should be made to identify the insurance of all potential tortfeasers involved and
the status of any claims made, and to demand contribution or indemnity where substantial reason exists to believe
that liability for the loss or damage should be shared. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) When a claim is filed against the Government under a subpart that does not permit the payment of a subrogated interest
(subparts E, J, K), it is important to ensure that full information is obtained from the claimant regarding insurance
coverage since it is the legislative intent of the statutes upon which these subparts are based that insurance coverage
be fully utilized before using appropriated funds to pay the claims.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) General. Settlement means denial or payment of a claim in full or in part. When an approval or settlement authority
determines that a claim is meritorious in an amount within his or her monetary jurisdiction, the claim will be approved
in that amount under the statute determined to be proper regardless of the statutory basis asserted by the claimant.
Every effort will be made to settle claims at the lowest level possible commensurate with the actual value of the claim.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Award of full amount claimed. If an approval or settlement authority approves a claim in full, the claim will be
certified for payment to the appropriate disbursing officer. Enclosures listed in &sect;536.35 will be forwarded
with the claim. The claimant will be notified of the action taken on the claim. A settlement agreement is required prior
to payment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Award of less than full amount. When an approval or settlement authority determines that a claim is meritorious
in part, he or she will_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Notify the claimant in writing of his or her action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Request the execution of a settlement agreement (in triplicate) in final and complete settlement of the claim
in the reduced amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If an approval authority, inform the claimant that if he or she does not desire to accept the award, he or she should
indicate in the reply the reasons for rejection. If a settlement authority, and the action is taken under subparts
C or F, inform the claimant of the right to appeal. (See &sect;536.63 and &sect;536.103.) DA Pam 27&hyph;162 provides
sample formats for letters notifying claimants of the actions taken on their claims. (Fig 5&hyph;10 is to be used by
field approving and settlement authorities; figs 5&hyph;8 through 5&hyph;11 are to be used by claims authorities
in conjunction with &sect;536.37 of this part.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Nonacceptance of reduced award. When a claimant rejects a partial award, the approval authority may reconsider
the matter and, if justified, make further efforts to settle the claim. When further efforts to settle appear unwarranted,
the claim and related file will be forwarded to the settlement authority having jurisdiction over the largest claim
or potential claim arising out of the incident with a memorandum of opinion. The claimant should be advised of such
referral. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Civil works claims. Engineer civil works claims settled under the provisions of the FTCA in an amount of $2,500
or less normally are paid out of funds controlled by the COE rather than claims appropriations. Unsettled claims in
this category should, therefore, be forwarded to the Commander, USARCS. An information copy will be sent to the COE,
ATTN: Chief Counsel, unless the latter waives that requirement. Civil works claims received outside engineer channels
should be forwarded without further action to the district or division engineer in whose area the incident occurred,
or to the COE, ATTN: Chief Counsel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Settlement of property damage claims. All claims submitted for only property damage or for only personal injury
should be evaluated for other potential claims. Under tort claims statutes, only one payment may be made to a claimant
on all claims arising out of a single incident. Therefore, a property damage claim arising from an incident in which
the claimant sustained injury should not be paid unless the claimant executes a release for any potential injury claim.
Likewise, when a property damage claim is settled the claimant should be informed that subsequent claims for hidden
damage or loss of use are precluded by the settlement.

(a) Claims beyond monetary jurisdiction. If the chief of a command claims service or the head of a claims office considers
a claim meritorious in an amount exceeding their jurisdiction, they will forward the claim with a memorandum of opinion
to the settlement authority having jurisdiction over the largest claim or potential claim arising out of the incident.
The claimant should be informed of this referral. In most cases the claimant should not be informed of the amount of
award recommended. However, for claims arising under the Foreign Claims Act notice of the amount recommended may
be required in accordance with &sect;536.156.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) In foreign countries where the amount agreed to does not exceed $2,500.00, the requirement for obtaining a guardian
may be eliminated. However, in areas where the FTCA (subpart D) applies, local law should be consulted as a basis for
determining whether a court appointed guardian should be required. The requirement to appoint a guardian should
not be imposed until a particular claim is determined to be meritorious in an amount that would require the appointment
of a guardian. The claimant should be advised of this requirement well in advance of settlement negotiations so that
the cost of establishing guardianship can be considered by the claimant as a factor in evaluating the claim. This requirement
also can be eliminated if local law authorizes or requires a claim such as for death of a parent of the minor, to be presented
on behalf of the estate of the decedent by an administrator, administratrix, or the like. In such cases, a settlement
agreement signed by the administrator, administratrix, or the like will suffice if, under local law, such action
is binding on the minor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The above provisions are in addition to, not in lieu of, the requirements of &sect;536.20(a)(5).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Claims involving incompetents. The above stated principles may also be applied in appropriate cases involving
incompetents. Authority to waive the foregoing requirements in appropriate cases is delegated to the Commander,
USARCS. If it is felt that the foregoing requirements are materially impeding settlement of the claim, the matter
should be brought to the attention of the Commander, USARCS for appropriate resolution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Claims involving workmen's compensation carriers. The settlement of a claim involving a claimant who has elected
to receive workmen's compensation benefits under local law may require the consent of the workmen's compensation
carrier and in certain jurisdictions the State agency with authority over workmen's compensation awards. Accordingly,
claims approval and settlement authorities should be aware of local requirements.

Vouchers are prepared in an original and three copies. The original and two copies (one marked as comeback copy) will
be transmitted to the disbursing office and one copy retained as a suspense copy. Upon payment of the claim, the disbursing
office will return the comeback copy, which will be included in the file when it is transmitted to the Commander, USARCS
for post settlement review.

Accounting codes.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Certifying an approved claim for payment creates an obligation against the claims appropriation for the fiscal
year then in progress. Accordingly, the voucher will bear the appropriate accounting code for both the appropriation
charged and the current fiscal year, irrespective of the date the claim accrued or was filed. Confusion sometimes
arises at the end of a fiscal year; for example, an approved claim is certified for payment on 28 September (the last
business day of a fiscal year), but it is obvious that it will not be actually paid (i.e., a check issued by the disbursing
activity) until on or after 1 October (the first day of the following fiscal year). At the time the check is issued, the
accounting code will not be advanced to the next fiscal year. Claims checks are issued using the accounting code of
the fiscal year in which the claim was certified for payment (i.e., the fiscal year in which the voucher was signed).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The accounting code for each type of claim remains constant, except for the third digit of the code which is the second
digit of the fiscal year (e.g., ``O'' for ``FY90''). The accounting codes for claims appropriations are published
each fiscal year in the AR 37&hyph;100 series. Accounting codes used in the payment of claims and refunds, and their
references, are listed below; the ``X'' denotes the space where the second digit of the fiscal year appears.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The voucher (SF 1034 or SF 1145 as appropriate) in triplicate, with a request that one copy be returned with voucher

. At installations where electronic payment procedures have been implemented, the approving or settlement authority
will electronically transmit payment information to the servicing finance and accounting office. The claim, the
settlement agreement, any actions or other required documents, and the original power of attorney will not be transmitted
to the finance and accounting office, but will be retained in the claims file. Instead, a ``payment report'' produced
by the claims automation program provided such offices by USARCS, which evidences or supports the fact that a claims
official has approved a claim payment, will be transmitted to the disbursing activity in accordance with locally
established procedures. The method of transmission used should not result in avoidable or significant delay in the
issuance of checks for claims payments. The payment report includes_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The name of the payee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The payee's social security number (if available).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The payee's address.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The date the claim was filed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The amount of the approved payment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) The date the payment was recorded in claims records.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Standard Form 1145 will be signed by the settlement authority on the lower left side only. The space on the right
side for the authorized certifying officer will not be signed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Where a minor is payee, the full legal name of the individual should be listed on the voucher; for example, ``John
Doe, Sr., as guardian of John Doe, Jr.'' Descriptive words such as ``Mrs. John Doe and her three minor children'' should
not be used.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(ii) The accounting classification will not be placed on the voucher. This is accomplished by the GAO as the payment
is made from Treasury funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The letter of transmittal to the GAO will include a statement that the individual whose signature appears on the
voucher as certifying authority is the person having authority to act under the provisions of the FTCA and &sect;536.80.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Advance payment. When it has been determined that an advance payment will be made, the approval or settlement authority
will transmit to the appropriate disbursing officer_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) SF 1034 (in triplicate) with a request that one copy be returned with voucher number and date of payment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The original copy and one copy of the action by the approval or settlement authority authorizing advance payment
and the Advance Payment Acceptance Agreement. (See &sect;536.47)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Payment involving minors. Payment will be made to the individual who executed the settlement agreement on behalf
of the minor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Lost, stolen, forged, destroyed, or undeliverable Government checks. Army disbursing officers have the authority
to issue substitute checks for checks that have been issued by the Army and that are subsequently lost, destroyed,
or rendered undeliverable. (See AR 37103, chap 4, secs. VII through X.) Some Federal agencies do not yet have this authority.
Inquiries from payees or endorsees of Army-issued checks should be referred to an Army comptroller; inquiries regarding
other agencies should be referred to the specific agency involved. For claims paid by the GAO, if the Treasury check
is lost or stolen, the payee or endorsee should be referred to the Check Forgery Insurance Fund, Department of the Treasury
(31 U.S.C. 3343, 31 CFR 235.1 through 235.6). The Fund can reimburse such losses provided the specific requirements
of the Statute are met. The Fund is administered by the Commissioner, Financial Management Service, Department of
the Treasury, 3700 East-West Highway, Hyattsville, MD 20782.

Acceptance of an award by the claimant, except for advance payment, constitutes for the United States, military personnel,
or civilian employee whose act or omission gave rise to the claim, a release from all liability to the claimant, based
on the act or omission. However, on tort claims only one payment may be made for all damages a claimant sustains from
an incident. Therefore, a signed unconditional settlement agreement is needed to ensure that the claimant understands
the finality of accepting payment.

(a) General. The nature and extent of the written notification to the claimant as to the denial of his or her claim should
be based on whether the claimant has a judicial remedy following denial or an administrative recourse to appeal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Final actions under subpart D. If the settlement authority has information that could be a persuasive factor for
the claimant as to whether to resort to litigation, such information may be orally transmitted to the claimant and,
in appropriate cases, released under normal procedures in accordance with AR 340&hyph;17 or AR 340&hyph;21. However,
the written notification of the denial should be general in nature; for example, denial on the weaker ground of contributory
negligence should be avoided and the inclination should be to deny on the basis that the claimant was solely responsible
for the incident. The claimant will be informed in writing of his or her right to bring an action in the appropriate U.S.
District Court not later than 6 months after the date of mailing of the notification. See DA PAM 27&hyph;162, figures
5&hyph;8 and 5&hyph;9.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Final actions under subparts C, F and J. Final agency actions under subparts C, F or J are subject to appeal and the
claimant will be so informed. Also, the notice of final action will be sufficiently detailed to provide the claimant
with an opportunity to know and attempt to overcome the basis for denial. The claimant should not be afforded a valid
basis for claiming surprise when an issue adverse to him or her is asserted as a basis for denying the appeal (see DA Pam
27&hyph;162, figures 5&hyph;8 and 5&hyph;9).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Denials on jurisdictional grounds. Regardless of the nature of the claim or the statute under which it may be considered,
claims denied on jurisdictional grounds that are valid, certain, and not easily overcome (and for this reason no detailed
investigation as to the merits of the claim is conducted) should contain in the denial letter a statement that the denial
on such grounds is not to be construed as an expression of opinion on the merits of the claim or an admission of liability.
If sufficient factual information is available to make a tentative ruling on the merits of the claim, liability may
be expressly denied.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Claims that may be considered under more than one subpart. In doubtful cases as to whether subparts C, D and F are
the appropriate subparts to consider the claim, the claimant will be advised of the alternatives; for example, the
right to sue or the right to appeal. Similarly, a claimant may be advised of his or her alternative remedies when the
claimant is a military member and the issue of ``incident to service'' is not clear.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Denial after litigation. On those claims cognizable under the FTCA in which the claimant files suit after six months
without agency action, a formal denial will be sent to the claimant unless the Assistant United States Attorney responsible
for the litigation of the suit expressly directs otherwise. The denial will be on the basis that the claim is no longer
amenable to administrative settlement. Other reasons for denial may also be given.

&sect;&sect;536&hyph;38 through 536.43 provides an expeditious procedure for the investigation and payment of
claims (regardless of the amount claimed) that may be without extensive investigation. If it appears that a claim
should be denied or cannot be settled within the limits specified in &sect;&sect;536.38 through 536.43, it will be
fully investigated under normal procedures. The use of small claims procedures is not mandatory; however, these
procedures should be used whenever considered appropriate in the judgment of the claims approval or settlement authority,
as considerable processing time and expense is usually saved thereby. If a fully investigated claim is received by
an approval or settlement authority, which in his or her opinion could properly have been processed under small claims
procedures, the claim will be settled in accordance with normal procedures. Appropriate corrective action will
be taken to ensure the use of small claims procedures in similar future cases.

The investigation will be made so as to develop most expeditiously the facts necessary to determine whether the claim
is meritorious and in what amount. The evidence required may be obtained by telephone, from incident reports, and
other forms of hearsay evidence. Written statements of witnesses, written estimates of repairs, and the like are
not required. The approving authority must be convinced and state on DA Form 1668 that_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The United States is liable for the damage or injury incurred.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

will append a brief summary of the evidence developed. The summary may be used as a basis for completion of the investigation
after a claim has been filed. This report is exempted from control in accordance with AR 335&hyph;15, paragraph 7&hyph;2t.

(a) If the amount claimed under subpart K is not more than $1,000, or in the case of a tort claim is not more than $2500,
and is considered meritorious in full, the claims JA/attorney will complete DD Form 1842 or DA Form 1668 and pay the
claim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A claim under subpart K is meritorious in an amount of $1,000 or less, or if a tort claim is meritorious in the amount
of $2500 or less, the claim JA/attorney may settle the claim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) After coordination with the responsible approving or settlement authority, unit claims officers may be authorized
to attempt to procure a settlement agreement. If a settlement agreement is obtained, the claims officer will complete
the small claims certificate for the amount of recommended payment and transmit it, in triplicate, with the claim
and settlement agreement, to the approval or settlement authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) If a claimant refuses to accept a sum offered under this section or if it appears that a claim should be disapproved,
the small claims procedures will not be employed; the claim will be fully investigated and processed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Nonappropriated fund claims will be forwarded by the approval or settlement authority for payment as prescribed
in subpart L.

This section implements the act of 8 September 1961 (75 Stat. 488, 10 U.S.C. 2736) as amended by Pub. L. 90&hyph;521
(82 Stat. 874), Pub. L. 98&hyph;564, and Pub. L. 100&hyph;456. No new liability is created by 10 U.S.C. 2736, which
merely permits partial advance payments on meritorious claims as specified above. (See &sect;536.178 for emergency
partial payments in personnel claims, which are not governed by 10 U.S.C. 2736.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An advance payment not in excess of $100,000 is authorized in the limited category of claims resulting in immediate
hardship arising from incidents that are payable under subparts C, F or J. An advance payment is authorized only under
the following circumstances:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The claim must be determined to be cognizable and meritorious under the provisions of subparts C, F or J.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) There exists an immediate need of the person who suffered an injury, damage, or loss, or of the family of a person
who was killed for food, clothing, shelter, medical, burial expenses, other necessities, or other resources for
such expenses that are not reasonably available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The payee, so far as can be determined, would be a proper claimant, as is the spouse or next of kin of a claimant who
is incapacitated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The total damage sustained must exceed the amount of the advance payment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) A properly executed advance payment acceptance agreement has been obtained.

and (5) and &sect;536.103(c)(3), in amounts not exceeding $10,000, subject to advance coordination with USARCS
if the estimated total value of the claim exceeds their monetary authority. Requests for advance payments in excess
of $10,000 will be forwarded to USARCS for processing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

This subpart is applicable in all locations and prescribes the substantive bases and special procedural requirements
for the settlement of claims against the United States for death; personal injury; or damage, loss, or destruction
of property_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Caused by military personnel or civilian employees of the DA acting within the scope of their employment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Incident to the noncombat activities of the DA, provided such claim is not for personal injury or death of a member
of the Armed Forces or Coast Guard or civilian officer or employee whose injury or death is incident to service.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) General. Unless otherwise prescribed, a claim for personal injury, death, or damage or loss of real or personal
property is payable under this subpart when_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Caused by an act or omission determined to be negligent, wrongful, or otherwise involving fault of military personnel
or civilian officers or employees of the DA acting within the scope of their employment, including certain Red Cross
volunteers meeting the criteria in AR 40&hyph;3, paragraph 2&hyph;42, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Incident to the noncombat activities of the DA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Property. The loss or damage to property that may be the subject of claims under this subpart includes_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Real property used and occupied under lease, express or implied, or otherwise (for example, in connection with
training, field exercises, or maneuvers). An allowance may be made for the use and occupancy of real property arising
out of trespass or other tort, even though claimed as rent. (See DA PAM 27&hyph;162, paragraph 8&hyph;46.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Personal property bailed to the Government under an agreement, express or implied, unless the owner has expressly
assumed the risk of damage or loss. Some losses may be payable using Operations and Maintenance, Army funds. (See DA
PAM 27&hyph;162, paragraph 8&hyph;41.) Clothing damage or loss claims arising out of the operation of an Army Quartermaster
laundry are considered to be incident to service and are payable only if claimant is not a proper claimant under subpart
K.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Registered or insured mail in the possession of the DA, even though the loss was caused by a criminal act. (See DA
PAM 27&hyph;162, paragraph 8&hyph;61 for settlement of claims by the U.S. Postal Service.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Effect of FTCA. A claim may be settled in the United States only if the FTCA has been judicially determined not to
be applicable to claims of this nature or if the claim arose incident to noncombat activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Advance payments. Advance payments (10 U.S.C. 2736, as amended) in partial payment of meritorious claims to alleviate
immediate hardship are authorized as provided in subpart B.

to the Army, or is for precious jewels or other articles of extraordinary value voluntarily bailed to the Army. The
preceding sentence is not applicable to claims involving registered or insured mail. No allowance will be made for
any item when the evidence indicates that the acquisition, possession, or transportation thereof was in violation
of DA directives.

(g) Is for rent, damage, or other payments involving the acquisition, use, possession, or disposition of real property
or interests therein by and for the DA, except as authorized by &sect;536.50(b). Real estate claims founded upon contract

(h) Is not in the best interests of the United States, is contrary to public policy, or is otherwise contrary to the basic
intent of the governing statute (10 U.S.C. 2733); for example, claims by inhabitants of unfriendly foreign countries
or by or based on injury or death of individuals considered to be unfriendly to the United States. When a claim is considered
to be not payable for the reasons stated in this paragraph, it will be forwarded for appropriate action to the Commander,
USARCS, together with the recommendations of the responsible claims office.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Is presented by a national, or a corporation controlled by a national, of a country at war or engaged in armed conflict
with the United States, or any country allied with such enemy country unless the appropriate settlement authority
determines that the claimant is and, at the time of the incident, was friendly to the United States. A prisoner of war
or an interned enemy alien is not excluded as to a claim for damage, loss, or destruction of personal property in the
custody of the Government otherwise payable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) Is for personal injury or death of a member of the Armed Forces or Coast Guard or a civilian employee that is incident
to his or her service (10 U.S.C. 2733(b)(3)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Claims having multiple remedies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Claims cognizable under other subparts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Claims based upon a single act or incident cognizable under this subpart and subparts H or K will be first considered
under the latter subparts; if not payable under any of those subparts, the claim will be considered under this subpart.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A claim may not be paid under this subpart if it is covered by the Federal Tort Claims Act (subpart E) or the Foreign
Claims Act (subpart J). (See 10 U.S.C. 2733(b)(2)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Where a Status of Forces Agreement or other agreement provides for host country adjudication of a claim, the treaty
process may be the claimants exclusive remedy (see subpart G). Where a foreign country is responsible for adjudication
of the claim under the terms of such an agreement, it may not be paid under the provisions of this subpart. If the foreign
country refuses to recognize legal responsibility for the claim, or to consider it under applicable treaty provisions,
the chief of a command claims service or, where the estimated value of the claim is within USARCS authority, the Commander,
USARCS may authorize adjudication of the claim under this subpart. The mere fact a foreign country fails to pay the
claims on its merits is not sufficient basis for invoking this authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Claims based upon multiple acts or theories of liability. Where claims cognizable under this subpart are based
upon more than one act or injury and where one or more of the acts or injuries are also cognizable under the FTCA (subpart
D) (for example, claims alleging acts of medical malpractice both in a foreign country and in the United States or claims
alleging negligence in the conduct of a noncombat activity), the claims will be processed as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Meritorious claims.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If the primary cognizable act or incident upon which the claim is based is not cognizable under subpart D, the claim
may be considered and paid under this subpart. However, the settlement agreement must expressly release the United
States from any further liability under the FTCA or any other statute or regulation for all acts or incidents upon which
the claim was based. If the claim is over $25,000, any proposed settlement will be coordinated with USARCS prior to
final action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the primary cognizable act or incident upon which the claim is based is cognizable under subpart D, the claim
will be first considered under subpart D. If the claim is determined by proper authority to be nonmeritorious under
subpart D but meritorious under this subpart (for example, negligence occurred overseas but none occurred in the
United States or there is no negligence in the conduct of a noncombat activity), it may be considered and paid under
this subpart. However, an agreed settlement must be reached that expressly releases the United States from further
liability under the FTCA or any other statute or regulation for all acts or incidents upon which the claim was based.
If the claim was presented in an amount over $25,000, any proposed settlement will be coordinated with USARCS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Nonmeritorious claims. Where claims are based upon multiple acts or incidents, some or all of which may be cognizable
under subpart D (Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA)), extreme care will be taken prior to any disapproval based upon this
subpart. Whether a claim is covered by Cognizability under the FTCA is a litigable issue. Such claims will be disapproved
under this subpart only as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A claim presented in an amount not over $25,000, may be disapproved by an office with settlement authority having
jurisdiction over the claim only if the claim is determined to be nonmeritorious under both this subpart and subpart
D; however the disapproval procedures established in subpart D must be fully satisfied. In such cases, the disapproval
notification will advise the claimant of his or her concurrent rights to appeal the disapproval under this subpart
or to institute suit under the FTCA. (See &sect;536.63.) In case of doubt concerning the applicability of this paragraph,
the question will be referred to USARCS.

(ii) Claims of the type covered by this paragraph, which are presented in an amount over $25,000, will be disapproved
only by the USARCS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Claims in litigation. Disposition under this subpart of any claim of the type covered by this paragraph that goes
into litigation in any State or Federal court under any State or Federal statute or ordinance will be suspended pending
disposition of such litigation, and the claim file will be forwarded to USARCS. The Commander, USARCS, in coordination
with the U.S. Department of Justice, may determine that final disposition under this subpart during pendency of the
litigation is in the best interests of the United States. This paragraph will also apply to any litigation brought
against any agent of the United States in his or her individual capacity that is based upon the same acts or incidents
upon which a claim under the subpart is based.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) When claim must be presented. A claim may be settled under this subpart only if presented in writing within 2 years
after it accrues. If a claim accrues in time of war or armed conflict, or if war or armed conflict intervenes within 2
years after it accrues, and if good cause is shown, the claim may be presented not later than 2 years after war or armed
conflict is terminated. As used in this paragraph, a war or armed conflict is one in which any Armed Force of the United
States is engaged. The dates of commencement and termination of an armed conflict must be established by concurrent
resolution of Congress or by determination of the President.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Where claim must be presented. A claim must be presented to an agency or instrumentality of the DA. However, the
statute of limitations is tolled if a claim is filed with another Government agency and forwarded to the DA within 6
months, or if the claimant makes inquiry of the DA concerning his or her claim within 6 months after it was filed with
another agency of the Government. If a claim is received by an official of the DA who is not a claims approval or settlement
authority under this subpart, the claim will be transmitted without delay to the nearest claims office or JA office
for delivery to such an office.

Law applicable to liability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Claims arising within the United States, and its territories, commonwealths and possessions. As to claims arising
in the United States, its territories, commonwealths, and possessions, the law of the place where the act or omission
occurred will be applied in determining liability and the effect of contributory negligence on the claimant's right
to recover damages. However, theories of strict or absolute liability will not be applicable to claims under this
subpart.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Claims arising within foreign countries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For claims arising in a foreign country, liability of the United States will be assessed by reference to the law
of the District of Columbia applicable to torts committed in and having their operative effect in the District (i.e.,
District of Columbia choice of law rules will not be applicable). The United States shall be liable in the same manner
and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances, except that theories of absolute or strict
liability may not be applied under this subpart. Damages will be determined under the provisions of &sect;536.56
through &sect;536.59.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The law of the place in which the alleged negligent act occurred will be applied to determine the effect of the claimant's
own negligence on the merits of the claim. Where there is no law on this issue, the MCA requires application of traditional
rules of contributory negligence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In traffic accident cases, questions of negligence, and the degree of the claimant's comparative negligence,
will be evaluated based on the traffic and vehicle safety laws and regulations of the country in which the accident
occurred, but only to the extent they are not specifically superseded or preempted by U.S. military traffic regulations.
Likewise, where a claim is based on the failure to comply with some safety or regulatory standard, the standard applicable
at the time and in the place where the claim arose will be used, rather than any comparable standard in the District of
Columbia.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) General. The measure of damages in property claims arising in the United States or its possessions will be determined
in accordance with the law of the place where the incident occurred. The measure of damages in property claims arising
overseas will be determined in accordance with the law of the District of Columbia (see &sect;536.55(a)). However,
punitive or exemplary damages, including damages considered punitive in nature under 28 U.S.C. 2674, and interest
on any settlement are not payable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Proof of damage. The information listed in paragraphs (b)(1) thru (4) (similar to that required by 28 CFR 14.4(c)

(4) Statement giving date of purchase, price, and, where not economically repairable, the salvage value.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Appraisals. The assistance of appraisers should be used in all claims where, in the opinion of the claims officer,
an appraisal is reasonably necessary and useful in effectuating the administrative settlement of claims. (See &sect;536.26

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Where an injury or an injury resulting in death arises within the United States or its possessions, the measure
of damages will be determined in accordance with the law of the State or possession wherein the injury arises. However,

Measure of damages in injury or death claims arising in foreign countries.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Where a claim for an injury, or injury resulting in death, arises outside of the United States or its possessions,
the elements of damages payable under this subpart will be the same as those payable in a similar claim arising under
the law of the District of Columbia applicable to torts committed in and having their operative effect in the District
of Columbia. The amount paid will be based on generally accepted economic principles. All awards for future payments
of economic damages will be discounted to present value. Awards under this subpart will be reduced by any benefits
which have been or are reasonable likely to be paid, if the benefit or payment is from the general revenues of the United
States and the claimant did not contribute to or purchase the benefit. In death cases, taxes and personal consumption
will be deducted from any award for lost economic contribution or lost earnings. Punitive or exemplary damages, including
damages considered punitive in nature under 28 U.S.C. 2674, and interest on any settlement are not payable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The information listed in &sect;536.57(b) or (c), as appropriate, will be submitted by the claimant to substantiate
a claim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) A claimant who alleges a serious personal injury resulting in temporary or permanent disability should be examined
by an independent physician or other medical specialist. The purpose of the examination is not just to confirm the
impairment but also to help assess its extent, prognosis and treatment. See &sect;536.27 for independent medical
examination procedures.

(a) The Government is not obligated to take final action on a claim until it has been supported by the claimant with specific
facts substantiated by appropriate documentary evidence, reports of investigation, medical records, or witness
statements. As the burden of proof is on the claimant, the failure to substantiate a claim within a reasonable time
can be the basis for denial of the claim. Upon request, the claimant must_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Provide the documentation required by &sect;&sect;536.56 through 536.58.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Undergo necessary medical examinations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Permit questioning of the claimant, his or her witnesses, and treating medical personnel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Submit an expert opinion in a professional negligence action.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Settlement of multiple claims arising from a single incident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Where a single act or incident gives rise to multiple claims cognizable under this subpart, and where one or more
of these claims apparently cannot be settled within the jurisdiction of the authority initially acting on the claims,
no final offer will be made and all claims will be forwarded with recommendation as to disposition to the authority
having jurisdiction over the largest claim for a determination of liability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If such authority determines that liability of the United States is established, he or she may return claims of
lesser value to the field office for settlement within that office's jurisdiction. Care will be exercised by the field
office to avoid compromising the discretion of the higher authority by conceding liability in claims of lesser amount.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Army or designee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For claims presented for $100,000 or less and any denied claim, regardless of the amount claimed, in which the denial
was based solely upon an incident to service bar (FERES), on exclusionary language in a federal statute governing
compensation of federal employees for job related injuries (see, for example, &sect;536.75 (s) and (t)) or upon the
lack of timely filing, final decisions on appeals will be made by TJAG or TAJAG, except that claims presented for $25,000
or less and not acted on by the Commander, USARCS are governed by paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For claims presented for $25,000 or less, final decisions on appeals will be made by the Commander, USARCS, or his

Army, the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Financial Management) as designee of the Secretary or designee, or require
the claimant to state the lowest amount that will be acceptable and provide appropriate justification. Tender of
a final offer by the Commander, USARCS, constitutes an action subject to appeal. The Commander, USARCS, will prepare
a memorandum of law with recommendations and forward the claim to the Secretary of the Army, or designee, for final
action. The Secretary, or designee, will either disapprove the claim or approve it in whole or in part.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If one or more claims arising from an incident are approved in an amount over $100,000, only $100,000 will be paid
from the Claims Appropriation, after the execution of a settlement agreement. The excess will be reported to the Claims
Division, GAO, 441 G Street, NW, Washington, DC 20548, together with documents listed in &sect;536.35(a).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Procedures. Approval and settlement authorities will follow the procedures set forth in subpart B in paying,
denying, or making final offers on claims. A copy of the notification will be forwarded to Commander, USARCS. The settlement
authority will notify the claimant by certified mail (return receipt requested) of a denial or final offer and the
reason therefor as set forth in &sect;536.37. The letter of notification will inform claimants of the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) They must accept or appeal as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The official who will act on the appeal and that the appeal will be addressed to the settlement authority who last
acted on the claim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) No form is prescribed for the appeal but claimants must fully set forth the grounds for appeal, or state that they
appeal on the basis of the record as it exists at the time of denial or final offer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The appeal must be postmarked not later than six months after the date of mailing of the notice of action on the claim.
If the last day of the appeal period falls on a day on which the post office is closed, the next day on which it is open for
business will be considered the final day of the appeal period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Acceptance and appeal. For final offers, a settlement agreement releasing the government from all liability
will be mailed along with the final offer notice. Claimants will be advised that they must either submit an appeal or
accept the offer within 180 days of the date of mailing of the final offer notice. If they fail to do either, the offer
will be withdrawn, the claim will be denied and the file will be closed without further recourse.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Companion FTCA claims. Where a claim for the same injury has been filed under subpart D, and the denial or final offer
applies equally to such claim, the letter of notification must advise the claimant that any suit brought as to any portion
of the claim filed under the FTCA must be brought not later than 6 months from the date of mailing of the notice of denial
or final offer. Further, the claimant must be advised that if suit is brought, action on any appeal under this subpart
will be held in abeyance pending final determination of such suit.

Action on appeal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The appeal will be examined by the settlement authority who last acted on the claim or his or her successor, to determine
if the appeal complies with the requirements of this regulation. The settlement authority will also examine the claims
investigative file; and decide whether additional investigation is required; ensure that all allegations or evidence
presented by the claimant, agent, or attorney are documented in the file; and ensure that all pertinent evidence is
included in the file. If the claimant states that he or she appeals, but does not submit supporting materials within
the 180 day appeal period, the appeal will be treated as being on the record as it existed at the time of denial or final
offer. Unless action under paragraph (b) of this section is taken, the claim and complete investigative file, including
any additional investigation required, and a tort claims memorandum will be forwarded to the appropriate appellate
authority for necessary action on the appeal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If the evidence in the file, including information submitted by the claimant with the appeal and any necessary
additional investigation, indicates the appeal should be granted, in whole or in part, the settlement authority
who last acted on the claim or his or her successor will attempt to settle the claim. If a settlement cannot be reached,
the appeal will be forwarded in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) As to an appeal that requires action by TJAG, TAJAG, or the Secretary of the Army or designee, the Commander, USARCS
may take the action in paragraph (b) of this section or forward the claim together with a recommendation for action.
All matters submitted by the claimant will be forwarded and considered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Since an appeal under this subpart is not an adversary proceeding, no form of hearing is authorized. A request by
the claimant for access to documentary evidence in the claims file to be used in considering the appeal should be granted
unless access is not permitted by law or regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) If the appeal authority upholds a final offer or authorizes an award on appeal from a denial of a claim, the notice
of the appellate authority's action will inform the claimant that they must accept the award within 180 days of the
date of mailing of the notice of the appellate authority's action or the award will be withdrawn, the claim will be deemed
denied and the file will be closed without further recourse.

In the settlement of any claim pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2733 and this subpart, attorney fees will not exceed 20 percent
of the final cost to the United States of the award. On structured settlements, the cash payment due immediately upon
final approval must be sufficient to allow payment of attorneys fees equal to 20% of the total cost of the settlement.

Authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statutory authority for this subpart is the FTCA (60 Stat. 842), (28 U.S.C. 2671&hyph;2680), as amended by the
Act of 18 July 1966 (Pub. L. 89&hyph;506; 80 Stat. 306), Pub. L. 93&hyph;253, 16 March 1974 (88 Stat. 50), and Pub. L.
97&hyph;124, 29 December 1981, and as implemented by the Attorney General's Regulations (28 CFR 14.1&hyph;14.11).

Scope.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) This subpart prescribes the substantive bases and special procedural requirements for the administrative settlement
of claims against the United States under the FTCA and the implementing Attorney General's Regulations (DA Pam 27&hyph;162,
appendix H) based on death, personal injury, or damage to or loss of property that accrues on or after 18 January 1967.
If a conflict exists between this subpart and the Attorney General's Regulations, the latter governs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Citations to cases interpreting and applying the FTCA are contained in the Federal Tort Claims Handbook provided
by USARCS. That handbook should be used in conjunction with this subpart.

Claims payable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Unless otherwise prescribed, claims for death, personal injury, or damage to or loss of property (real or personal)
are payable under this subpart if the injury or damage is caused by negligent or wrongful acts or omissions of military
personnel or civilian employees of the DA or DOD while acting within the scope of their employment under circumstances
in which the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place
where the act or omission occurred. The FTCA is a limited consent to liability without which the United States is immune.
Similarly, there is no Federal cause of action created by the Constitution that would permit a damage recovery because
of the Fifth Amendment or any other constitutional provision. Immunity must be expressly waived, as by the FTCA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) An ``employee of the Government'' (28 U.S.C. 2671) includes the following categories of tortfeasors for which
the Army is responsible:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Military personnel (members of the Army), including but not limited to_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Members on full-time active duty in a pay status, including members_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Assigned to units performing active service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Serving as ROTC instructors. (Excludes Junior ROTC instructor unless on active duty.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Serving as NG instructors or advisors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) On duty or training with other Federal agencies, for example, National Aeronautics and Space Administration,
DOD, State, Navy, or Air Force.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) Assigned as students or ordered into training at a nonFederal civilian educational institution, hospital, factory,
or other industry. (This does not include members on excess leave.)

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(F) On full-time duty at nonappropriated fund activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(G) Of the USAR and ARNG on active duty under Title 10.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Members of Reserve Units (other than members of the ARNG under subpart F) during periods of inactive duty training
and active duty training, including ROTC cadets who are reservists while they are at summer camp.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Members of the ARNG while engaged in training or duty under Title 32 U.S.C. section 316, 502, 503, 504, or 505 for
claims arising on or after 29 December 1981.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Civilian officials and employees of both the DOD and DA (there is no practical significance to the distinction
between the terms ``official'' and ``employee'') including but not limited to_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Civil Service and other full-time employees of both the DOD and DA paid from appropriated funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Contract surgeons (10 U.S.C. 1091 4022; AR 40&hyph;1, paragraph 4&hyph;2) and consultants (10 U.S.C. 1091;
AR 40&hyph;1, paragraph 4&hyph;3; CPR A&hyph;9; FPM chapter 304) where ``control'' is exercised over physician's
day to day practice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Employees of nonappropriated funds if the particular fund is an instrumentality of the United States and thus
a Federal agency. In determining whether or not a particular fund is a ``Federal agency,'' consider whether the fund
is an integral part of the Army charged with an essential DA operational function and the degree of control and supervision
exercised by DA personnel. Members or users, as distinguished from employees of nonappropriated funds, are not considered
Government employees; the same is true of family child care providers. However, claims arising out of the use of certain
nonappropriated fund property, or the acts or omissions of family child care providers, may be payable from such funds
under subpart L as a matter of policy, even when the user is not within the scope of employment and the claim is not otherwise
cognizable under any of the other authorizations in this regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Prisoners of war and interned enemy aliens.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Civilian employees of the District of Columbia National Guard, including those paid under ``service contracts''
from District of Columbia funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Civilians serving as ROTC instructors paid from Federal funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) National Guard technicians employed under 32 U.S.C. 709(a) for claims accruing on or after 1 January 1969 (Pub.
L. 90&hyph;486, 13 Aug. 1968; 82 Stat. 755).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Persons acting in an official capacity for the DOD or DA whether temporarily or permanently in the service of the
United States with or without compensation including but not limited to_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) ``Dollar a year'' personnel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Members of advisory committees, commissions, boards, or the like.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Volunteer workers in an official capacity acting in furtherance of the business of the United States. The general
rule with respect to volunteers is set forth in 31 U.S.C. 665(b), which provides that, ``No officer or employee of the
United States shall accept voluntary service for the United States or employ personal service in excess of that authorized
by law, except in cases of emergency involving the safety of human life or the protection of property.'' Title 5, U.S.C.,
section 3111(c) specifically provides that student volunteers employed thereunder will be considered Federal
employees for purposes of the FTCA. The same classification is applied by 10 U.S.C. 1588 to museum and family support
program volunteers. The Army is permitted to accept and use certain volunteer services in Army family support programs
as authorized by Pub. L. 98&hyph;94, September 24, 1983. Red Cross volunteers meeting the criteria set forth in AR
40&hyph;3, paragraph 2&hyph;42, are also considered to be employees of the United States for claims purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Loaned servants. Employees who are permitted to serve another employer may be considered ``loaned servants,''
provided the borrowing employer has the power to discharge the employee, control and direct the employee, and decide
how he or she will perform the tasks. Whoever has retained those powers is liable for the employee's torts under the
principle of respondent superior. Where those elements of direction and control have been found, the United States
has been liable; for example, for the torts of Government employees loaned for medical training and emergency assistance
and county and state employees discharging Federal programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) ``Scope of employment'' means acting in ``line of [military] duty'' (28 U.S.C. 2671) and is determined in accordance
with principles of respondent superior under the law of the jurisdiction in which that act or omission occurred. Determination
as to whether a person is within a category listed in paragraph (b)(3) of this section will usually be made together
with the scope determination. Local law should always be researched, but the novel aspects of the military relationship
should be kept in mind in making a scope determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) ``Line of duty'' determinations under AR 600&hyph;8&hyph;1 are not determinative of scope of employment. ``Joint
venture'' situations are likely to be frequent where the Federal employee is performing federally assigned duties
but is under actual direction and control of a non-Federal entity; for example, a Federal employee in training at a
non-Federal entity or ROTC instructors at civilian institutions. This could also occur where the employee is working
for another Federal agency. Furthermore, dual purpose situations are commonplace where benefits to the Government
and the member or employee may or may not be concurrent; for example, use of privately owned vehicles at or away from
assigned duty station, or permanent change of station with delay en route. (See subpart E for the handling of certain
claims arising out of nonscope activities of members of the Army.)

Indemnity or contribution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Sought by the United States. It is the policy of the Department of Justice that, if the claim arises under circumstances
in which the Government is entitled to contribution or indemnity under a contract of insurance or the applicable law
governing joint tortfeasors, the third party will be notified of the claim and will be requested to honor its obligation
to the United States or to accept its share of joint liability. (See &sect;&sect;536.28 and 536.29.) If the issue of
indemnity or contribution is not satisfactorily adjusted, the claim will be compromised or settled only after consultation
with the Department of Justice as provided in &sect;536.75(s).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Claims for indemnity or contribution. Claims for indemnity or contribution from the United States will be compromised
or settled under this subpart, if liability exists under the applicable law, provided the incident giving rise to
such claim is otherwise cognizable under this subpart. As to such claims where the exclusivity provisions of the FECA
may be applicable, see &sect;536.75(s). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) ARNG vehicular claims.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) When a vehicle used by the ARNG, or a POV operated by a member or employee of the ARNG, is involved in an incident under
circumstances that make this subpart applicable to the disposition of administrative claims against the United
States and results in personal injury, death, or property damage, and a remedy against the State, or its insurer is
indicated, the responsible area claims authority will monitor the action against the State or its insurer and encourage
direct settlement between the claimant and the State or its insurer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Where the State is insured, direct contact with State or ARNG officials rather than the insurer is desirable. Regular
procedures will be established and followed wherever possible. Such procedures should be agreed on by both local
authorities and the appropriate claims authorities subject to concurrence by Commander, USARCS. Such procedures
will be designed to ensure that local authorities and U.S. authorities do not issue conflicting instructions for
processing claims and, whenever possible and in accordance with governing local and Federal law, a mutual arrangement
for disposition of such claims as in paragraph (d) of this section is worked out.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Amounts recovered or recoverable by claimant from any insurer (other than claimant's insurer who has obtained
no subrogated interest against the United States) will be deducted from the amount otherwise payable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Claims arising out of training activities of NG personnel. Contribution may be sought from the State involved
where it has waived sovereign immunity or has private insurance that would cover the incident giving rise to the particular
claim. Where the State involved rejects the request for contribution, the file will be forwarded to the Commander,
USARCS. The Commander, USARCS, is authorized to enter into an agreement with a State, territory, or commonwealth
to share settlement costs of claims generated by the ARNG personnel or activities of that political entity.

Exclusions listed in paragraphs (a) through (l) of this section are based upon the wording of 28 U.S.C. 2680. The remainder
are based either on statute or court decisions. The interpretation of these exclusions is a Federal question to be
decided under Federal law; for example, the tort of assault and battery listed in 28 U.S.C. 2680(h) should be interpreted
in accordance with Federal common law principles, and where State law differs, the former will prevail. Where a claim
is considered not payable under this paragraph, consult DA Pam 27&hyph;162, chapter 8 for other methods of handling.
A claim is not payable under this subpart if it_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Is based upon an act or omission of an employee of the Government, exercising due care, in the execution of a statute
or regulation, whether or not such statute or regulation is valid (28 U.S.C. 2680(a)). Where no negligence on the part
of any Government employee is shown, and the only ground for the claim is the contention that the same conduct by a private
individual would be tortious, or that the statute or regulation authorizing the project was invalid, the sole question
is the existence of the statute or regulation, not its validity. However, a claim should not be denied based solely
on this exception without the prior approval of the Commander, USARCS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Is based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty
on the part of a Federal agency or an employee of the Government, whether or not the discretion involved is abused (28
U.S.C. 2680(a)). A claim should not be denied solely because of this exception without the prior approval of the Commander,
USARCS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Arises out of the loss, miscarriage, or negligent transmission of letters or postal matter (28 U.S.C. 2680(b)).
It should be noted that administrative settlement and payment of certain mail claims is authorized under subparts
C and F. Further, a limited indemnity may be obtained through other channels for the loss or damage to registered, insured,
and C.O.D. mail (39 U.S.C. 5001, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 8&hyph;61). The exclusion may not be applicable where State law recognizes a
cause of action for invasion of privacy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Arises with respect to the assessment or collection of any tax or customs duty, or the detention of any goods or merchandise
by any customs or other law-enforcement officer (28 U.S.C. 2680(c)). Adequate remedies are available to anyone aggrieved
by the application of the tax or customs laws of the United States (26 U.S.C. 6213), or the claimant may pay the tax and
sue in the U.S. Claims Court or the appropriate U.S. District Court for a refund (28 U.S.C. 1491 and 1346(a)(1)). Other
remedies are also available for the loss or detention of goods or merchandise; for example, Tucker Act, bailment provisions
of the MCA (chap. 3), or destruction of evidence for scientific analysis (AR 190&hyph;22, paragraph 3&hyph;8). With
respect to the detention of goods by a law enforcement officer, this exception may apply to seizures in connection
with an arrest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Is cognizable under the Suits in Admiralty Act (46 U.S.C. 740&hyph;752) or under the Public Vessels Act (46 U.S.C.
781&hyph;790). To be cognizable under this exclusion, the tort must have a maritime situs and a maritime nexus, otherwise
the tort is cognizable under the FTCA. Maritime claims may be considered under The Army Maritime Claims Settlement
Act (10 U.S.C. 4801, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and subpart H, and they must be settled or suit filed within 2 years of accrual of claim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Arises out of an act or omission of any employee of the Government in administering the provisions of the Trading
With the Enemy Act (50 U.S.C. appendix 1&hyph;31; 28 U.S.C. 2680(e)). That Act provides that the sole remedy of any
person claiming money or other property held by the Alien Property Custodian is as provided by that Act. This exception
should be broadly construed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Is for damages caused by the imposition or establishment of a quarantine by the United States (28 U.S.C. 2680(f)).
Claims for failure to impose a quarantine or delay in enforcing a quarantine come within the discretionary function
exclusion discussed in paragraph (b) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Arises out of an assault or battery (28 U.S.C. 2680(h)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Often artful pleading is employed to create a cause of action in negligence, such as alleging negligent supervision;
such does not create a separate cause of action as the exception bars a claim arising out of an assault and battery even
though there may have been negligent supervision. Under the 1974 amendment to 28 U.S.C. 2680(h), the activities of
law enforcement officers that result in an assault or battery are removed from this exception and can create a cause
of action. Such activities have accounted for most of the past claims and litigation involving the assault and battery
exception.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Therefore, any claim alleging use of threatening or deadly force, especially by a law enforcement officer, must
be thoroughly investigated to determine whether the nature, amount, and use of such force was justified under the
circumstances. (See paragraph (i) of this section for definition of investigative or law enforcement officer).
Also, section 2680(h) does not apply to a claim arising out of performance of medical, dental or related health care
functions (10 U.S.C. 1089(e)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Arises out of false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution or abuse of process (28 U.S.C. 2680(h)).
This exception has universal applicability to tall acts of false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution,
or abuse of process when committed by an employee of the United States in the scope of employment. However, by amendment
to 28 U.S.C. 2680(h), this exception is not applicable on or after 16 March 1974 to such actions when committed by an
investigative or law enforcement officer of the United States who is empowered by law to execute searches, seize evidence,
or make arrests for violations of Federal law (88 Stat. 50). Such employees are considered to include military police,
but not post exchange detectives. Whether or not a Federal law enforcement officer is involved, the defenses of probable
cause, reasonableness, and good faith are available, provided the arrest is otherwise lawful under State law. DA
Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 8&hyph;8c, refers to certain claims based on unjust convictions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) Arises out of libel, slander, misrepresentation, or deceit (28 U.S.C. 2680(h)). The misrepresentation exception
has been broadly construed to include negligent as well as intentional misrepresentation. It has not been applied
in situations involving negligent failure to perform some operational task or to convey information related to public
safety independent of any secondary misstatement. Where an erroneous medical diagnosis is made, the exception does
not apply because malpractice is the gravamen of the action and the misrepresentation incidental. Similarly, the
misrepresentation exception was held not applicable where the United States sold bomb casings to a scrap dealer expressly
warranting that they were safe and fit for scrap metal processing, and one of the casings exploded. Before this exception
can be applied in the determination of an administrative tort claim, the claims investigation must consider the nature
of the Government's acts or omissions, as well as the information upon which the claimant may have relied to his or her
detriment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(k) Arises out of interference with contract rights (28 U.S.C. 2680(h)). This exception includes both interference
with existing contract rights and interference with prospective or executed contract rights or economic advantage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(l) Arises from the fiscal operations of the Department of the Treasury or from the regulation of the monetary system
(28 U.S.C. 2680(i)). This exception includes all disbursing operations of the DA or other military services. However,
such claims may be forwarded through Army finance channels for consideration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(m) Arises out of the combat activities of the military or naval forces, or the Coast Guard, during time of war (28 U.S.C.
2680(j)). ``Combat activities'' is defined in the glossary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(n) Arises in a foreign country (28 U.S.C. 2680(k)). There is no clear delineation of what constitutes a foreign country.
However, the exception has been held applicable to claims arising in a leased military base in Newfoundland; in the
American Embassy in Bangkok, Thailand; on Okinawa under the de facto sovereignty of the United States; on Kwajalein
under the trusteeship of the United States; and to various occupied countries. (See subpart J and DA Pam 27&hyph;162,
paragraph 821, for handling of certain claims arising in a foreign country.) Where the actionable negligence has
occurred in the United States and only the consequences occurred in a foreign country, this exception has not been
applied.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(o) Arises from the activities of the Tennessee Valley Authority (28 U.S.C. 2680(i) and 16 U.S.C. 831

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(p) Arises from the activities of the Panama Canal Commission (28 U.S.C. 2680(m)). (See 76A Stat. 22 through 25, and
22 U.S.C. 3761.) Claims accruing after the effective date of the Panama Canal Treaty (1 October 1979) may be cognizable
under either the FCA or the MCA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(q) Arises from the activities of a Federal land bank, a Federal intermediate credit bank, or bank for cooperatives
(28 U.S.C. 2680(n)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(r) Is for the personal injury or death of a member of the Armed Forces of the United States incurred incident to service,
or for damage to a member's property incurred incident to service (Feres v. United States, 340 U.S. 135 (1950)). (See
&sect;536.25 and DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraphs 8&hyph;26 through 8&hyph;28.) Currently the most significant
justification for the incident to service doctrine is the availability of alternative compensation systems, and
the fear of disrupting the military command relationship. Other supportive factors often cited by the courts are
the service member's duty status, location, and receipt of military benefits at the time of the incident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The exception applies to members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, including the Reserve
Components of the Armed Forces. (See 10 U.S.C. 261.) The exception also applies to service members on the Temporary
Disability Retired List, on convalescent leave, and on the extended enlistment program; to service academy cadets;
and to members of visiting forces in the United States under the SOFA between the parties to the North Atlantic Treaty
or similar international agreements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The incident to service doctrine has been extended to derivative claims where the directly injured party is a service
member. Third party indemnity claims are barred.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(s) Is for the personal injury or death of a Government employee for whom benefits are provided by the FECA (5 U.S.C.
8101&hyph;8150). (See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 8&hyph;25.) Who is a Government employee under the Act is defined
in the Act itself (5 U.S.C. 8101), but the term is not limited to Federal Civil Service employees. The term ``Government
employee'' can include certain ROTC cadets (5 U.S.C. 8140) and State or local law enforcement officers engaged in
apprehending a person for committing a crime against the United States (5 U.S.C. 8191), certain nurses, interns,
or other health care personnel, for example, student nurses, (5 U.S.C. 5351, 8144), and certain Army Community Service
Volunteers (10 U.S.C. 1588; AR 608&hyph;1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) This Act provides that benefits paid under this Act are exclusive and instead of all other liability of the United
States, including that under a Federal tort liability statute (5 U.S.C. 8116(c)). It extends to derivative claims,
subsequent malpractice for treatment of a covered injury, injuries for which there is no scheduled compensation,
and employee harassment claims for which other remedies are available (42 U.S.C. 2000e).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Is from a federal civilian employee based on a allegation of a violation of some employment right or is otherwise
one for which the rules governing federal civilian employment provide a comprehensive remedy. Such claims often
allege emotional distress or psychological injury as a result of the alleged misconduct. Administrative remedies
under the civil service regulations are the employee's exclusive remedy. Bush v. Lucas 462 U.S. 367 (1983). This exception
does not bar third party indemnity claims. When there is doubt as to whether or not this exception applies, the claim
should be forwarded through claims channels to the Commander, USARCS, for an opinion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(t) Is for the personal injury or death of an employee including nonappropriated fund employees, for whom benefits
are provided by the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (33 U.S.C. 901&hyph;950). An employee of
a nonappropriated fund instrumentality is covered by the Act (5 U.S.C. 8171). This is exclusive for covered employees,
similar to that under the FECA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(u) Is for the personal injury or death of any employee for whom benefits are provided under any workmen's compensation
law if the premiums of the workmen's compensation insurance are retrospectively rated and charged as an allowable,
allocable expense to a cost-type contract. (See &sect;536.28 and DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 8&hyph;25.) If,
in the opinion of an approval or settlement authority the claim should be considered payable (for example, the injuries
did not result from a normal risk of employment or adequate compensation is not payable under workmen's compensation
laws), the file will be forwarded with recommendations through claims channels to the Commander, USARCS who may authorize
payment of an appropriate award.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Is for taking of property as by technical trespass or overflight of aircraft and of a type contemplated by the Fifth
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, or otherwise constitutes ataking. (See paragraph 2c of AR 405&hyph;15 and DA
Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraphs 8&hyph;46, 8&hyph;74, and 8&hyph;75.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides in part ``.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;. nor shall private
property be taken for public use, without just compensation.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Claims for takings without just compensation are action-able under the Tucker Act (28 U.S.C. 1346(a)(2) and 1491,
Appendix. A., 24 Stat. 505 (1887)). Prior to referring a claimant to a Tucker Act remedy, the applicability of the procedures
under AR 405&hyph;15 should be considered by referral to appropriate Corps of Engineers authorities. (See DA Pam
27&hyph;162, paragraph 8&hyph;75.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(w) Is for damage from or by flood or flood waters at any place (33 U.S.C. 702c). This exception is broadly construed
and includes multipurpose projects and all phases of construction and operation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(x) Is for damage to property or for any death or personal injury occurring directly or indirectly as a result of the
exercise of performance of, or failure to exercise or perform, any function or duty by any Federal agency or employee
of the Government to carry out the provisions of the Federal Civil Defense Act of 1950 during the existence of a civil
defense emergency (50 U.S.C. Appendix 2291&hyph;2297).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(y) Is based solely upon a theory of absolute liability or liability without fault. Either a negligent or wrongful
act is required by the FTCA, and some type of malfeasance or nonfeasance is required (Dalehite v. United States, 346
U.S. 15 (1953); Laird v. Nelms, 406 U.S. 797 (1972)). Thus, liability does not arise by virtue either of United States
ownership of an inherently dangerous commodity or of engaging in extra-hazardous activity.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(aa) Claims for damage to property of a State, commonwealth, territory, or the District of Columbia caused by ARNG
personnel engaged in training or duty under 32 U.S.C. 316, 502, 503, 504, or 505 who are assigned to a unit maintained
by that State, commonwealth, territory, or the District of Columbia will not be paid without the express approval
of the Commander, USARCS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(bb) Is for damage to property or for any death or personal injury arising out of the activities of any Federal agency
or employee of the Government in carrying out the provisions of the Federal Disaster Relief Act of 1954 (P.L. 93&hyph;288,
Sec. 403, 88 Stat. 143). The Act requires the local beneficiary (State or local government) to hold the Government
harmless and to assume the defense of all claims arising from the removal of debris and wreckage from public or private
property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(cc) Arises from activities that present a nonjusticiable political question. The courts search for six factors,
as follows, any one of which is grounds for dismissal:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A commitment of the issue to a coordinate branch of Government by the text of the Constitution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The impossibility of deciding without a policy determination calling for non-judicial discretion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The impossibility of undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of respect for coordinate
branches of Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) An unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The potential for embarrassment from multiple pronouncements by various departments on one question.

(a) General. Unless inconsistent with the provisions of this subpart, the procedures for the investigation and processing
of claims set forth in subpart B will be followed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Claims arising out of tortious conduct by ARNG personnel defined in subpart 536.71(b)(1)(iii).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Notification and investigation. The procedures in &sect;&sect;536.97 and 536.98 will be followed in NG claims
arising under the FTCA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Claims against the U.S. Government received by agencies of the State. These claims will be expeditiously forwarded
through the State adjutant general to the appropriate U.S. Army area claims office in whose geographic area the incident
occurred.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Statute of limitations. (1) To be settled under this subpart, a claim against the United States must be presented
in writing to the appropriate Federal agency within 2 years of its accrual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For statute of limitations purposes, a claim will be deemed to have been presented when the appropriate Federal
agency (as defined in the glosssary) receives from a claimant or his or her duly authorized agent or legal representative,
an executed SF 95 or written notification of an incident, together with a claim for money damages, in a sum certain,
for damage to or loss of property or personal injury or death. For Federal tort claims arising out of activities of the
NG, receipt of a written claim by any full time officer or employee of the NG will be considered proper receipt.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A claim received by an official of the DOD will be transmitted without delay to the nearest Army claims processing
office or area claims office. Inquiries concerning applicability of the statute of limitations to claims filed with
the wrong Federal Agency will be referred to USARCS for resolution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Claims within settlement authority of USARCS of the Attorney General. (1) A copy of each of the type of claims described
below will be forwarded immediately to the Commander, USARCS. (Subsequent documents should be forwarded or added
in accordance with &sect;536.22(b)(2).)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Claims that appear to be of a type that must be brought to the attention of the Attorney General in accordance with
his or her regulations (28 CFR 14.6). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A claim in which the demand exceeds $25,000 or the total amount of all claims, actual or potential, from a single
incident exceeds $25,000 $50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) USARCS is responsible for the monitoring and settlement of such claims and will be kept informed of the status of
the investigation and processing thereof. Direct liaison and correspondence between USARCS and the field claims
authority or investigator is authorized on all claims matters and assistance will be furnished as required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Non-Army claims. Claims based on acts or omissions of employees of the United States, other than military and civilian
personnel of the DA, civilian personnel of the DOD, and employees of nonappropriated fund activities of the DA will
be transmitted forthwith to the nearest official of the employing agency; the claimant will be advised of the referral.
(See &sect;536.18(c) and (d) for further guidance when more than one Federal agency is involved.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Acknowledgment of claim. (1) The claimant and his or her attorney will be kept informed by personal contact, telephonic
contact, or mail of the receipt of his or her claim and the status of the claim. Formal acknowledgment of the claim in
writing is required only where the claim is likely to result in litigation or is presented in an amount exceeding $15,000.
In this event, the letter of acknowledgment will state the date of receipt of the claim by the first agency of the Army
receiving the claim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If it is reasonably clear to the office acknowledging receipt that a claim filed under the FTCA is not cognizable
thereunder; for example, it is a maritime claim under chapter 8, or it falls under subparts C or F, the acknowledgment
will contain a statement advising the claimant of the statute under which his or her claim will be processed. If it is
not clear which subpart applies, a statement to that effect will be made and the claimant will be promptly advised when
a decision is made. However all potential maritime claims will be handled in accordance with &sect;536.21(b)(5).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) When a claim has been amended as set forth in &sect;536.20(f)(4), the amendment will be acknowledged in all cases.
Also, the claimant will be informed that the amendment constitutes a new claim insofar as concerns the 6 months in which
the DA is granted the authority to make a final disposition under 28 U.S.C. 2675(a) and the claimant's option thereunder
will not accrue until 6 months after the filing of the amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) When a claim is improperly presented, is incomplete, or otherwise does not meet the requirements set forth in section
536.20(d), the claimant or his or her representative will be promptly informed in writing of the deficiencies and
advised that a proper claim must be filed within the 2 year statute of limitations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Investigation. Claims cognizable under this regulation will be investigated and processed on a priority basis
in order that settlement if indicated may be accomplished within the 6 months prescribed by statute.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Advice to claimant. (1) A full explanation of claims procedures and of the rights of the claimant will be made to
the extent necessitated by the amount and nature of the claim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In a case where litigation is likely, or where this course of action is preferred by the claimant, and it appears
to be a proper case for administrative settlement, the claimant will be advised as to the advantages of administrative
settlement. If the claim is within the jurisdiction of a higher settlement authority, the claim will be discussed
with such authority prior to the furnishing of such advice. The claimant should be familiarized with all aspects of
administrative settlement procedures including the administrative channels through which the claim must be processed
for approval. He or she may be advised that administrative processing can result in more expeditious processing,
whereas litigation may take considerable time, particularly in jurisdictions with crowded dockets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If appropriate, the claimant may be informed that a tentative settlement can be reached for any amount, but that
awards in excess of $200,000 are subject to approval by the Attorney General. The claimant should be advised that administrative
filing of the claim protects him or her under the statute of limitations for purpose of litigation and that a suit can
be filed within 6 months after the date of mailing of notice of final denial by the DA, thus potentially allowing negotiations
to continue indefinitely. An attorney representing a claimant should be advised of the limitations on fees for purposes
of administrative settlement (20 percent) and litigation (25 percent) and that there is no jury trial under the FTCA.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) Notification to claimant of action on claim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The filing of an administrative claim and its denial are prerequisite to filing suit. Any suit must be filed not
later than 6 months after notification by certified or registered mail of the denial of the administrative claim.
Failure of a settlement authority to take final action on a properly filed claim within 6 months may be treated by the
claimant as a final denial for the purposes of filing suit. If the claimant has provided insufficient documentation
to permit evaluation of the claim, written notice should be given to this effect. Since administrative settlements
are a voluntary process, the preferred method of negotiating is to attempt to exchange information on an open basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Upon final denial of a claim, or upon rejection by claimant of a partial allowance, if further efforts to reach a
settlement are not considered feasible (&sect;536.21(b)(1)), the settlement authority will inform the claimant
of the action on his or her claim by certified or registered mail. Notification will be made as set forth in &sect;536.37(b).
A copy of this notification will be furnished to Litigation Division, OTJAG, and the Commander, USARCS. In all medical
malpractice cases, a copy will be furnished to the Consultation Case Review Branch (CCRB), Office of the Surgeon Command
and the SJA, Health Services Command.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If a claim has been presented to the DA and, also, to other Federal agencies, without any notification to the DA of
this fact, final action taken by the DA prior to that of any other agency is conclusive on a claim presented to other agencies
unless another agency decides to take further action to settle the claim. Such agency may treat the matter as a reconsideration
under 28 CFR 14.9(b) unless suit has been filed. (See &sect;536.82.) The foregoing applies likewise to Army claims
in which another Federal Agency has taken final action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If, after final denial by another agency, a claim is filed with the Army, the new submission will not toll the 6 months
limitation for filing suit unless the DA treats the second submission as a request for reconsideration under &sect;536.82.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) In those cases where claimants exercise their option under 28 U.S.C. 2675(a) and file suit after six months but
before final agency action, a formal denial notice will be sent to the claimant promptly upon notification of the suit
unless the Assistant United States Attorney responsible for litigation of the suit expressly requests that such
action not be taken.

Payment of claims.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Awards of $2,500 or less. Awards of $2,500 or less are paid from the claims appropriation. For procedures, see &sect;&sect;536.32
through 536.35. An explanation of various claims appropriations to be used is in &sect;536.34.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Awards in excess of $2,500. Payment of awards in excess of $2,500 will be accomplished by forwarding the documents
listed in &sect;536.35(b) to the Claims Division, GAO, 441 G Street, NW., Washington, DC 20548. When an award is in
excess of $25,000, evidence that the award has been approved by the Attorney General or designee is also required.
(For procedures, see &sect;&sect;536.32 through 536.35.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Attorney as payee. If a claimant is represented by an attorney, both the claimant and the attorney will be designated
as ``payees'' on the voucher (SF 1145) and the check will be delivered to the attorney whose address appears on the voucher.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Broker as payee. If the settlement requires the purchase of an annuity and establishment of a reversionary trust,
the broker may be named as payee and required to dispose of the amount paid as set forth in the settlement agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Attorneys fees. Attorneys' fees are limited by 28 U.S.C. 2678 to not more than 20 percent of any award, compromise,
or settlement.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The acceptance by the claimant of an award, compromise, or settlement made pursuant to this subpart will be final and
conclusive for all purposes and will constitute a complete release of any claim against the United States and against
the military or civilian personnel of the DA, or civilian employees of the DOD whose act or omission gave rise to the
claim by reasons of the same subject matter. (See &sect;536.32 on preparing a settlement agreement.)

a single claim or where the total value of all claims and potential claims arising out of a single incident exceeds $200,000
or as otherwise required (see &sect;536.81), the following are delegated authority to settle (i.e. pay in full, pay
in part or deny) and make final offers on claims under this subpart:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) TJAG.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The Commander, USARCS or designees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Unless the Commander, USARCS alters the delegation, heads of area claims offices or their designated claims Judge
Advocates/claims attorneys are delegated authority to approve and pay in full or in part, to disapprove, and to make
final offers on claims presented for $25,000 or less. These offices are also authorized to approve and pay, regardless
of the amount claimed, an agreed award of $25,000 or less, provided that the total value of all claims and potential
claims arising out of a single incident does not exceed $50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Notice of disapproval or final offer issued by an authority listed in paragraph (a) (1) and (2) of this section will
be in accordance with &sect;&sect;536.5(f) and 536.37 and must be accompanied by an explanation that the claimant
may submit a written request for reconsideration (&sect;536.82), in lieu of filing suit, to the Commander, USARCS
(through the office issuing the disapproval or final offer) provided that the request is received prior to the expiration
of the 6-month period provided in 28 U.S.C. 2401(b). Once received, the claimant will be advised in writing that the
request will suspend the option to bring suit under 28 U.S.C. 2675(a) for 6 months from the date the request was received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Heads of claims processing offices with approval authority are delegated authority to approve and pay, in full
or in part, claims presented for $5,000 or less and to compromise and pay, regardless of the amount claimed, an agreed
award of $5,000 or less, provided that the total value of all claims and potential claims arising out of a single incident
does not exceed $25,000 and that the claimant agrees to accept the award in full satisfaction of the claim.

(1) A new precedent or a new point of law is involved;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A question of policy is or may be involved;

Reconsideration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Original approval or settlement authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Reconsideration. An original approval or settlement authority may reconsider the denial of or final offer on
a claim under the FTCA upon request of the claimant, the claimant's authorized agent, or the claimant's legal representative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Settlement correction. An original approval or settlement authority may reopen and correct his or her action
on a claim that was previously settled in whole or in part (even where a settlement agreement has been executed) when
an error contrary to the mutual understanding of the parties is discovered in the original action (e.g., a claim is
settled for $15,000 but the settlement agreement was typed to read $1,500 and the error is not discovered until the
file is being prepared for payment). If appropriate, a corrected payment will be made. The approval or settlement
authority will reopen his or her action on a claim when he or she has reason to believe that a settlement was obtained
by means of fraud by the claimant (or claimant's authorized agent or legal representative) and, if substantiated,
will correct his or her action. The basis for any correction of an action will be stated in a memorandum which will be
included in the file.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A successor approval or settlement authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Reconsideration. A successor approval or settlement authority may reconsider the denial of or final offer in
a claim under the FTCA upon request of the claimant, the claimant's authorized agent, or the claimant's legal representative,
only on the basis of fraud, substantial new evidence, errors in calculation or mistake (misinterpretation) of law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Settlement correction. A successor approval or settlement authority may reopen and correct a predecessor's
action on a claim which was previously settled in whole or in part for the same reasons as an original authority, as stated
above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) All requests for reconsideration of a denial or final offer by a command claims service or area claims office in
which full relief is not granted will be forwarded to the Commander, USARCS for action, with any additional investigative
material and legal analysis generated by the request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) A request for reconsideration should indicate fully the legal or factual basis asserted as grounds for relief.
Following completion of any investigation or other action deemed necessary for an informed disposition of the request,
the approval or settlement authority will reconsider the claim and attempt to settle it by granting such relief as
may appear warranted. When further settlement efforts appear unwarranted, the entire file with a memorandum of opinion
will be referred through claims channels as outlined in &sect;536.31. If a higher claims authority is unable to grant
the relief requested, he or she will forward the claim with the recommendation to the Commander, USARCS, and inform
the claimant of such reference.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) A request for reconsideration must be filed prior to the commencement of suit and prior to the expiration of the
6-month period provided in 28 U.S.C. 2401(b). Upon timely filing, the appropriate authority will have 6 months from
the date of filing in which to make a final disposition of the request, and the claimant's option under 28 U.S.C. 2675(a)
will not accrue until 6 months after the filing of the request. The action on the request will be effected as set forth
in &sect;536.77(i).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Action upon a request for reconsideration by the appropriate authority (either affirming the prior action or
granting full or partial relief) constitutes final administrative disposition of a claim. No further requests for
reconsideration will be allowed except on the basis of fraud. Attempted further requests for reconsideration on
other grounds will not toll the 6-month period provided in 28 U.S.C. 2401(b).

The statutory authority for this subpart is contained in the act of 9 October 1962 (76 Stat. 767, 10 U.S.C. 2737). This
statute is commonly called the ``Nonscope Claims Act.'' For the purposes of this subpart, a Government installation

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) This subpart prescribes the substantive bases and special procedural requirements for the administrative settlement
and payment, in an amount not more than $1,000, of any claim against the United States not cognizable under any other
provision of law for damage or loss of property, or for personal injury or death caused by a member or employee of the
DA incident to the use of a U.S. vehicle at any location or incident to the use of other U.S. property on a Government installation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Any claim in which there appears to be a disputed issue relating to whether the employee was acting within the scope
of employment will be considered under subparts C, D, and F of this part. Only when all parties, to include an insurer,
agree that there is no ``in scope'' issue will this subpart be used.

(2) The claim may not be settled under any other claims statute and claims regulation available to the DA for the administrative
settlement of claims.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The claim has been determined to be meritorious, and the approval or settlement authority has obtained a settlement
agreement in an amount not in excess of $1,000 in full satisfaction of the claim prior to approval of the claim for payment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) A claim is not allowable under this subpart that_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Results wholly or partly from the negligent or wrongful act of the claimant or his or her agent or employee. The doctrine
of comparative negligence is not applicable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Is for medical, hospital, and burial expenses furnished or paid by the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Is for any element of damage pertaining to personal injuries or death other than provided in &sect;536.85(b).
All other items of damage; for example, compensation for loss of earnings and services, diminution of earning capacity,
anticipated medical expenses, physical disfigurement, and pain and suffering are not payable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Is for loss of use of property or for the cost of a substitute property; for example, a rental.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Is legally recoverable by claimant under an indemnifying law or indemnity contract. If the claim is legally recoverable

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Is a subrogated claim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Examples of claims not allowable under this subpart are as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The claimant has collision insurance covering his or her automobile with a deductible amount of $100. While the
claimant is sitting in the vehicle, which is properly parked, it is struck from the rear by an Army truck operated by
a DA civilian who had misappropriated the Government vehicle. The claimant sustains personal injuries requiring
hospitalization for 6 weeks during which actual medical and hospital expenses are incurred in the amount of $1,200.
He or she has no medical or hospitalization insurance. The damage to the vehicle totals $300. The claimant's insurance
carrier reimburses him or her $200 for the vehicle damage and becomes subrogated in that amount under the policy terms.
The claimant files a claim in the amount of $1,500, alleging $300 for property damage to the automobile and $1,200 for
medical and hospital expenses. The claim is allowable in the total amount of $1,000, consisting of $100, the insurance
deductible for property damage, and $900 of the medical and hospital expenses. The amount claimed for medical and
hospital expenses and for property damage merely constitutes separable interests in a single claim that may not be
allowed in an amount in excess of $1,000 under this subpart. The claimant's insurer is not a proper party claimant,
and no payment is allowable for the insurer's subrogated interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Claimant has medical and hospitalization insurance that entitles him or her to reimbursement of up to $500 for
the reasonable cost of medical and hospital expenses incurred for personal injuries. While visiting at an Army installation
the claimant is wounded by the negligent discharge of a Government issue caliber .45 pistol by a soldier who had stolen
the weapon. The claimant is hospitalized at a civilian hospital and has incurred medical and hospital expenses of
$750. The claimant may be paid $250, the amount allowable for reasonable medical and hospital expenses actually incurred
after deduction of $500 legally recoverable by him or her under the insurance policy.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) An original approval or settlement authority may reconsider the quantum of a claim upon request of the claimant
or someone acting in his behalf. In the absence of such a request, an approval or settlement authority may on his or her
own initiative reconsider the quantum of a claim. Reconsideration may occur even in a claim that was previously disapproved
in whole or in part (even though a settlement agreement has been executed) when it appears that his or her original action
was incorrect in law or fact based on the evidence of record at the time of the action or subsequently received. If he
or she determines that the original action was incorrect, he or she will modify the action and, if appropriate, make
a supplemental payment. If the original action is determined correct, the claimant will be so notified. The basis
for either action will be stated in a memorandum included in the file.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) An approval or settlement authority may reconsider the applicability of this subpart to a claim upon request of
the claimant or someone acting in his behalf, or on his or her own initiative. Such reconsideration may occur even though
all parties had previously agreed per &sect;536.84 when it appears that this agreement was incorrect in law or fact
based on the evidence of record at the time of the agreement or subsequently received. If he or she determines the agreement
to be incorrect, the claim will be reprocessed under the applicable subpart of this part. If he or she determines the
agreement to have been correct, that is, that this subpart is applicable, he or she will so advise the claimant. This
advice will include reference to any appeal or judicial remedies available under the subpart which the claimant alleges
the claim should be processed under.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) A successor or higher approval or settlement authority may also reconsider the original action on a claim under
paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, but only on the basis of fraud, substantial new evidence, errors in calculation,
or mistake (misinterpretation) of law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) A request for reconsideration should indicate fully the legal or factual basis asserted as grounds for relief.

Statutory authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The statutory authority for this subpart is contained in the Act of 13 September 1960 (74 Stat. 878, 32 U.S.C. 715),
commonly referred to as the ``National Guard Claims Act'' as amended by Pub. L. 90&hyph;486, 13 August 1968, (82 Stat.
756), Pub. L. 90&hyph;525, 26 September 1968 (82 Stat. 877), Pub. L. 901&hyph;312, 8 July 1970 (84 Stat. 412), and Pub.
L. 93&hyph;336, 8 July 1974, and the Act of 8 September 1961 (75 Stat. 488, 10 U.S.C. 2736) as amended by Pub. L. 90&hyph;521,
26 September 1968 (82 Stat. 874) and as amended by Pub. L. 98564, 20 October 1984.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) For purposes of this subpart, the following terminology applies:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) ARNG personnel. A member of the ARNG engaged in training or duty under 32 U.S.C. sec 316, 502, 503, 504, 505, or 709.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Claimant. An individual, partnership, association, corporation, country, State, commonwealth, territory,
or a political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia presenting a claim and meeting the conditions set
forth in &sect;536.20. The term does not include the U.S. Government, any of its instrumentalities, except as prescribed
by statute, or a State, commonwealth, territory, or the District of Columbia, which maintains the unit to which the
ARNG personnel causing the injury or damage are assigned. This exclusion does not ordinarily apply to a unit of local
government that does not control the ARNG organization involved. As a general rule, a claim by a unit of local government
other than a State, commonwealth, or territory will be entertained unless the item claimed to be damaged or lost was
procured or maintained by State, commonwealth, or territorial funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) State. As used in this subpart the term ``state'' includes selfgoverning commonwealths and territories of the
United States; for example, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.

(2) Noncombat activities of the ARNG when engaged in training or duty under 32 U.S.C. sec. 316, 502, 503, 504, 505, or
709, provided such claim is not for personal injury or death of a member of the Armed Forces or Coast Guard.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) An employee whose injury or death is incident to service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A claimant dissatisfied with an administrative settlement under this subpart as the result of activities of the
NG of a State, Commonwealth, or Territory is not entitled to judicial relief in an action against the United States.
Whether he or she has a legal cause of action or may file an administrative claim against such political entity depends
upon controlling local law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Claims arising out of the activities of the ARNG when performing duties at the call of the governor of a State maintaining
the unit are not cognizable under this subpart or any other law, regulation, or appropriation available to the Army
for the payment of claims. Such claims should be returned or referred to the authorities of the State, for whatever
action they choose to take and claimants should be informed of the return or referral. Care should be taken to determine
the status of the unit; members at the time the claims incident occurred, particularly in civil emergencies as units
called by the governor, are sometimes ``federalized'' during the call-up. If the unit was federalized at the time
the claims incident occurred, the claim will be cognizable under subparts C, D and F or other subparts pertaining to
the Active Army.

activity within the scope of employment, with the United States while engaged in training or duty under 32 U.S.C. Sections
316, 502, 503, 504, 505, or 709 will be processed under the FTCA (subpart D). Such claims arising before 29 December

Except where claims are regularly paid from State sources; for example, insurance, court of claims, and legislative
committee, the appropriate adjutant general will ensure that each incident of the type enumerated in &sect;536.15
is reported immediately by the most expeditious means to the area claims office in whose geographic area the incident
occurs or to a claims processing office designated by the area claims office. The report will contain the following
information:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) By whom made. Area offices, or claims processing offices designated by them, are responsible for the investigation
of claims occurring within their assigned geographic areas. The state adjutant general will designate an official
or office as point of contact for Army claims personnel and will furnish necessary personnel to conduct or assist in
investigations subject to the availability of funds and personnel. (See &sect;536.7(h)). The use of ARNG personnel
when available, is authorized. Attention is directed to &sect;536.19(b) that requires the use of information from
other investigations made previously, particularly military and civilian police reports, reports of survey, line
of duty investigations, and collateral air crash investigations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Conduct of investigation. The investigation will be conducted in accordance with subpart B, except that a sample
scope of employment format will be added, together with a copy of the orders authorizing the performance of duty by
the tortfeasor. Also, where a State has waived immunity or has some other means for paying claims, as through legislative
committee or insurance, the claims officer's report will contain a statement as to the nature of the remedy against
the State, the extent of insurance coverage, and the status of any claim made. If there is no remedy against the State
and no insurance coverage, the claims officer's report will so indicate. If a regular procedure has been established
for the processing of claims for a particular jurisdiction as by agreement between local authorities and an appropriate
Army headquarters or USARCS, this requirement is waived. Finally, injury should be made as to any existing or anticipated
claim or lawsuit against or by the driver of the ARNG vehicle or insurer. If a claim or lawsuit has been filed, further
inquiry should be made as to probable outcome. This could be accomplished by discussion with the driver and an examination
of the driver's insurance policy, which, if obtained, should be included in the file.

Claims in which there is a State source of recovery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Where there is a remedy against the State, as a result of either waiver of sovereign immunity or liability insurance
coverage, the following procedures apply:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Where the State is insured, direct contact with State or ARNG officials rather than the insurer is desirable. Regular
procedures will be established and followed wherever possible. Such procedures should be agreed on by both local
authorities and the appropriate claims authorities subject to concurrence by Commander, USARCS. Such procedures
will be designed to ensure that local authorities and U.S. authorities do not issue conflicting instructions for
processing claims, and whenever possible, and in accordance with governing local and Federal law, a mutual arrangement
for disposition of such claims as in paragraph (c) of this section is worked out. Amounts recovered or recoverable
by claimant from any insurer (other than claimant's insurer who has obtained no subrogated interest against the United
States) will be deducted from the amount otherwise payable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If there is a remedy against the State or its insurer, the claimant may be advised of that remedy. If the payment by
the State or its insurer does not fully compensate claimant, an additional payment may be made. If liability is clear
and claimant settles with the State or its insurer for less than the maximum amount recoverable, the difference between
the maximum amount recoverable and the settlement normally will be deducted from the payment by the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If the State or its insurer desires to pay less than their maximum jurisdiction or policy limit on a basis of 50 percent
or more of the actual value of the entire claim, any payment made by the United States must be made directly to the claimant.
This can be accomplished by either having the United States pay the entire claim and have the State or its insurer reimburse
its portion to the United States, or by having each party pay its agreed share directly to the claimant. If the State
or its insurer desires to pay less than 50 percent of the actual value of the claim, the procedure set forth in paragraph
(d) of this section will be followed.

(d) If there is a remedy against the State and the State refuses to make payment, or there is insurance coverage and the
claimant has filed an administrative claim against the United States, forward file with Tort Claim memorandum to
the Commander, USARCS; include information on the status of any judicial or administrative action the claimant has
taken against the State or its insurer. The Commander, USARCS will determine whether the claimant will be required
to exhaust his or her remedy against the State or its insurer, or whether the claim against the United States can be settled
without such requirement. If the Commander, USARCS, determines to follow the latter course of action, he or she will
also determine whether an assignment of the claim against the State or its insurer will be obtained and whether recovery
action will be taken. The State or its insurer will be given appropriate notification in accordance with State law
necessary to obtain contribution of indemnification.

Claims against the ARNG tortfeasor individually.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The procedures set forth in &sect;536.29 are applicable. With respect to claims arising before 29 December 1981,
an ARNG driver acting pursuant to the authorities cited in &sect;536.94(a) is not protected by the provisions of the
Drivers Act (28 U.S.C. 2670(b)); the driver may be sued individually in State court. When this situation occurs, it
should be monitored closely by ARNG authorities. If possible an early determination will be made as to whether any
private insurance of the ARNG tortfeasor is applicable. Where such insurance is applicable and the claim against
the United States has doubtful validity, final actions will be withheld pending resolution of the demand against
the NG tortfeasor. If, in the opinion of the claims approving or settlement authority, such insurance is applicable
and the claim against the United States is payable in full or in a reduced amount, settlement efforts will be made either
together with the insurer or singly by the United States as in &sect;536.99(b). Any settlement will not include amounts
recovered or recoverable as in &sect;536.28. If the insurance is not applicable, settlement or disapproval action
will proceed without further delay.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A claim may be settled under this subpart only if presented in writing within 2 years after it accrues, except that if
it accrues in time of war or armed conflict, or if war or armed conflict intervenes within 2 years after it accrues, and
if good cause is shown, the claim may be presented not later than 2 years after war or armed conflict is terminated. As
used in this paragraph, war or armed conflict is one in which any Armed Force of the United States is engaged. The dates
of commencement and termination of an armed conflict must be established by concurrent resolution of Congress or
by determination of the President.

A claim must be presented to the appropriate Federal agency. Presentment of a written claim to any full time officer
or employee of the NG will be considered a receipt. However, the statute of limitations is tolled if a claim is filed
with a State agency, the claim purports to be under the NGCA and it is forwarded to the Army within 6 months, or the claimant
makes inquiry of the Army concerning the claim within 6 months. If a claim is received by a DA official who is not a claims
approval or settlement authority under this regulation, the claim will be transmitted without delay to the nearest
approval or settlement authority.

(a) This subpart provides procedures and defines responsibilities for the investigation, processing, and settlement
of claims arising out of acts or omissions of members of a foreign military force or civilian component present in the
United States, or a territory, commonwealth, or possession thereof under the provisions of reciprocal international
agreements, which contain claims settlement provisions applicable to claims arising in the United States, such
as Article VIII of the Agreement Regarding the Status of Forces of Parties to the North Atlantic Treaty (DA Pam 27&hyph;162,
appendix L).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Sending States under current international reciprocal agreements include Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Federal
Republic of Germany, France, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Turkey, the United Kingdom,
Spain, and SHAPE.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Reference should be made to DA Pam 27&hyph;162, appendix L for delineation of what constitutes a foreign military
force, a foreign civilian component, and a foreign dependent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Whenever claims arise involving foreign soldiers training or otherwise stationed in the United States pursuant
to bilateral agreements or other arrangements, such as foreign military sales agreements, which contain specific
claims provisions, the claims office receiving the claim will report such claims to the Commander, USARCS, for guidance
as to the resolution and, if necessary, payment of such claims.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The United States, as a Receiving State, is responsible under some Status of Forces Agreements, for the investigation
of incidents, and for the processing of claims, arising from acts or omissions of members or civilian employees of
an armed force of a sending state present in the United States. The United States may be liable for partial payment of
such claims if they arise incident to the official duties of the sending state's soldier or employee. Article VIII
of the NATO SOFA is the most commonly invoked agreement of this sort. It applies to torts committed within the North
Atlantic Treaty Area, which includes the continental United States and island possessions north of the Tropic of
Cancer (i.e. excludes Puerto Rico, Hawaii and American Samoa). It also applies to claims arising out of acts by military
or civilian personnel, regardless of nationality, who are assigned, attached to, or employed by an international
headquarters established under the provisions of the Protocol on the Status of International Military Headquarters
Set Up Pursuant to the North Atlantic Treaty dated August 28, 1952 (

Supreme Allied Command, Atlantic).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Single service responsibility for the processing and settlement of claims cognizable under this section is assigned
to DA by DODD 5515.8. The Secretary of the Army hereby designates the USARCS as the Receiving State Office for claims
cognizable under this section with authority to settle such claims in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2734b. (See DA Pam
27&hyph;162, appendix L.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) As Sending State forces are considered assimilated into the armed forces of the United States for purposes of the
SOFAs, their members are also barred from being compensated by the United States when they are injured incident to
their service,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order for the United States to properly discharge its claims responsibilities under international agreements,
it is essential that the responsible military authorities be notified of all incidents, including off-duty incidents,
in which members of a foreign military force or civilian component are involved. Any installation that learns of an
incident involving a member of a foreign military force or civilian component which results in personal injury, death,
or property damage will notify immediately by the most expeditious means the installation to which such person is
assigned or attached. An information copy of such notification will be furnished to the Commander, USARCS. In the
event the member is not assigned or attached to any installation within the United States, the Commander, USARCS will
be notified. The notification (exempt report, AR 335&hyph;15, paragraph 720) will contain so much of the following
information as is readily available:

Investigations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Immediate investigation of each incident involving a member of a foreign force or civilian component is required
in order to ensure that all necessary information, including necessary statements and depositions, is obtained
before the foreign personnel involved, either principals or witnesses, depart the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Responsibility for the investigation of an incident rests upon the commander of the installation to which the
member of a foreign force or civilian component is assigned or attached, or if not assigned or attached within the United
States upon the Commander, USARCS. He or she is authorized to designate an appropriate agency of the Armed Services
for this purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The installation responsible for the investigation will be free to request appropriate assistance from any other
installation within the DOD to the end that a reliable and complete investigation of the incident will be accomplished
most economically. Such requested assistance may be for an investigation of the entire incident, or it may cover only
part of the investigation; for example, it may be a statement from one witness. Normally such requests will be made
of an installation having claims responsibility under the appropriate departmental regulation and nearest the
place of the occurrence. In a case involving an aircraft, such request will normally be made of an installation that
also has the capability of investigating air accidents giving due regard to the type of aircraft. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The investigation will be made in accordance with the regulations of the department of which the installation
is a part. Also, information will be obtained as to whether the claimant is a member of a foreign force or civilian component,
or dependent of such a member or employee. If so, the following will be listed: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Any benefits the claimant may be entitled to from his or her own government whether he or she has applied, or intends
to apply, for such benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The value of any benefits to which the claimant may be entitled, which he or she may have received, or both. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The investigating officer will arrange with the commanding officer of the foreign unit to which a member of a foreign
force or civilian component is assigned, or the immediate superior of such member, to obtain from such member the pertinent
information and required reports. If the member is assigned or attached to a United States organization or installation,
information and reports will be obtained in accordance with the procedure applicable to United States personnel.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Notwithstanding the provisions of department regulations, a copy of the report of investigation will be forwarded
to the Commander, USARCS immediately upon completion.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Place and timing of filing. A claim should be filed with the commanding officer of the United States military installation
nearest the place where the incident occurred, but may be filed at any other such installation, within two years of
its accrual. Immediately upon receipt, a copy will be forwarded to Commander, USARCS. The claim and supporting documents
will conform to the regulations of the department of which the place of filing is a part. Claims filed with a sending
State official within 2 years of their accrual will be accepted as timely if received by a U.S. claims office (&sect;536.5)
before the passage of a total of 21/2 years from the date of accrual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Processing of claims. A claim normally will be processed by the installation that first investigated the incident
from which it arose in accordance with the pertinent departmental regulations. The commanding officer of an installation
with which a claim is filed may by direct communication ascertain whether the incident from which it arose was investigated
by another installation, and, if so, may transmit the claim for further processing to that installation. Upon completion
of investigation, the claim file will be forwarded to the Commander, USARCS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Official duty claims. Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2734b, claims generated by the sending State personnel, while engaged
in the performance of official duties, are settled by a person designated in &sect;536.111 in the manner provided
for claims generated by personnel of the armed forces of the United States, that is, under the MCA (subpart C), the FTCA
(subpart D) or the Army Maritime Claims Settlement Act (subpart H). The Commander, USARCS, will obtain scope of employment
determinations from sending State officials under the conditions set forth in Article VIII, NATO SOFA. Payments
made are subject to pro rata reimbursement by the sending State (paragraph 5, Article VIII, NATO SOFA (DA Pam 27&hyph;162,
appendix L)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Exgratia claims. Claims arising from off-duty activities of sending State personnel are, after investigation,
processing, and evaluation, referred by the Commander, USARCS to sending State officials for a determination as
to whether an exgratia payment will be offered (paragraph 6, Article VIII, NATO SOFA (DA Pam 27&hyph;162, appendix
L)).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) This section provides guidance on claims against the United States which are based on acts of our soldiers or employees
within the scope of their employment and which arise in countries for which there is an international agreement requiring
a foreign government (i.e. receiving state) to adjudicate and pay the claims subject to partial reimbursement by
the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Claims by foreign inhabitants based on acts of members of our forces which are outside the scope of their official
duties may be payable under the Foreign Claims Act (subpart J) but are usually not adjudicated by receiving states
under most international agreements. These non-scope claims will be processed under the provisions of subpart J.

Claims procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Claims provisions in Status of Forces Agreements providing for receiving state adjudication have been held to
be the exclusive remedy for claims against the United States, preempting any remedy that would otherwise be available
under other United States claims statutes, such as the Foreign Claims Act or the Public Vessels Act (Aaskov. v. Aldridge,
695 F. Supp. 595 (D.D.C. 1988)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) SOFA provisions for receiving state adjudication of claims against the United States usually refer to claims
by ``third parties'' against members of the force or civilian component. This clearly includes claims by tourists
or business travelers from the United States as well as inhabitants of foreign countries. Depending on how the receiving
state interprets the class of proper claimants under the SOFA claims provisions, the receiving state may also adjudicate
claims by dependents of our forces. Chiefs of command claims services responsible for claims arising in countries
with SOFA or other treaty provisions requiring adjudication of claims against the United States by a receiving state
will ensure their tort claims personnel are aware of the receiving state's policy on the issue of who are proper claimants
under the treaty provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Where SOFA provisions provide for receiving state adjudication of claims, the time limit for filing such claims
is often substantially less than the two years that would otherwise be allowed under the FCA or MCA. For example, the
Defense Cost Office in Germany requires that a claim be filed within 90 days of the date it accrues. Command claims services
will ensure that all claims personnel in their area of responsibility:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Receive annual training on the receiving state's claims procedures, to include the applicable time limits, procedures
and location of the appropriate receiving state claims office or agency;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Screen all new claims and inquiries about claims to identify claimants who must file with the receiving state;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Ensure that all such claimants are informed of this requirement and the applicable time limit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) All foreign inhabitants who have claims against the United States which are the responsibility of the receiving
state (i.e. based on acts within scope of duties of employees or members of U.S. forces and not otherwise excluded by
the treaty) will be required to file the claim with the appropriate receiving state office. Those U.S. inhabitants
whose claims would otherwise be cognizable under the Military Claims Act (subpart C) and who are deemed by the receiving
state to be proper claimants under the SOFA claims provisions must also file with the receiving state. However, if
they fail to do so, their claim may be considered under subpart C, for good cause, with the permission of the Commander,
USARCS. Claims for which a foreign country is responsible under a SOFA or similar agreement will not be paid under subpart
J or subpart C without prior approval of the Commander, USARCS or the senior JA in country (&sect;&sect;536.52(a)(3)
and 536.152(c)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) A claim filed and adjudicated by a receiving state under a SOFA or other international agreement claims provision
may be considered under other claims provisions of this regulation only if the receiving state denied the claim on
the basis that it was not cognizable under the treaty or agreement provisions. Where a claimant has filed a claim with
a receiving state and received payment, such payment will be the claimant's final and exclusive remedy against the
United States. If the claim is denied on the merits by the receiving state, that action will also be the claimant's final
and conclusive remedy against the United States.

Subrogation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) An insurer will be recognized as a claimant under this section to the extent that it has become subrogated by payment
to, or on behalf of, its assured, pursuant to a contract of insurance in force at the time of the incident from which the
claim arose. An insurer and its assured may file a claim either jointly or separately. Joint claims will be asserted
in the names of, and must be signed by, or on behalf of, all parties; payment then will be made jointly. If separate claims
are filed, payment to each party will be limited to the extent of such party's undisputed interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) For the purpose of determining authority to settle or compromise a claim, the payable interests of an insurer (or
assurers) and the assured represent merely separable interests, which interests in the aggregate must not exceed
the amount authorized for administrative settlement or compromise.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The policies set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section with respect to subrogation arising from insurance
contracts are applicable to all other types of subrogation.

Limitation of settlement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The period of effecting an administrative settlement under the Army Maritime Claims Settlement Act is subject
to the same limitation as that for beginning an action under the Suits in Admiralty Act; that is, a 2-year period from
the date the cause of the action accrued. The claimant must have agreed to accept the settlement, and it must be approved
for payment by the Secretary of the Army, or other approval authority, prior to the end of such period. The presentation
of a claim, or its consideration by the DA, neither waives nor extends the 2-year limitation period and the claimant
should be so informed in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) In the event that an action has been filed in a U.S. district court before the end of the 2-year statutory period,
an administrative settlement may be negotiated by the Commander, USARCS with the claimant, even though the 2-year
period has elapsed since the cause of action accrued, provided the claimant obtains the written consent of the appropriate
office of the Department of Justice charged with the defense of the complaint. Payment may be made upon dismissal of
the complaint.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) When a claim under this section, notice of damage, invitation to a damage survey, or other written document indicating
an intention to hold the United States liable is received, the receiving installation, office, or person, will immediately
forward such document to the Commander, USARCS. The USARCS claims office receiving notice of the claim will promptly
advise the claimant or potential claimant in writing of the comprehensive application of the time limit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Where a claim under this section for $25,000 or less is presented to a Corps of Engineers or other designated area
claims office (see &sect;&sect;536.128(c) and 536.132(c) and thus may be appropriate for action by that office pursuant
to the delegation of authority set forth in &sect;536.128, the receiving Corps of Engineer office will promptly advise
the claimant in writing of the comprehensive application of the time limit on the Army's authority to settle the claim
as well as the fact that the claim does not toll the statute of limitations for filing suit. (See &sect;536.12(b)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Claimants are not required to file an administrative claim six months prior to filing suit except for those claims
where maritime jurisdiction is based on the Act Extending the Admiralty and Maritime Jurisdiction (46 U.S.C. 740)
(i.e. damage or injury on land resulting from an act on navigable waters). However, even in those cases, the filing
of an administrative claim does not toll the two year statutory limit for filing suit nor extend the authority of the
Army to settle a claim. Any such claim filed within six months of the running of the statute of limitations should be
brought to the attention of USARCS immediately and every reasonable effort should be made to complete final agency
action before the running of the two year limit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Limitation of Liability. Under the provisions of the Limitation of Shipowners' Liability Act, 46 U.S.C. 181&hyph;188,
the United States may be able, in cases alleging injury or loss due to negligent operation of a vessel, to limit our liability
to the value of the vessel after the accident. To take advantage of this law, the United States must file an action in
federal district court within six months of receiving written notice of a claim. Therefore, USARCS must be notified
within 10 workdays of the receipt of any maritime claim arising in the United States or on the high seas out of the operation
of an Army vessel, to include pleasure craft owned by the United States. The Claims Service will coordinate with Litigation
Division, OTJAG or the Chief Counsel, COE and the Department of Justice on whether a limitation of liability action
will be filed.

or the designee of the Secretary may approve any settlement or compromise of a claim under this subpart subject only

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) TJAG, TAJAG and the Commander, USARCS or his designee within USARCS are delegated authority to settle (i.e. deny
or approve payment in full or in part) any claim under this subpart regardless of the amount claimed, provided that
any amount awarded does not exceed $100,000 and that the claimant signs an appropriate settlement agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Chiefs of command claims services, heads of Corps of Engineers area claims offices and heads of other area claims
offices designated by the Commander, USARCS, are delegated authority to deny claims under this subpart presented
in an amount not exceeding $25,000. They may also pay in full or compromise any claim where the amount to be paid does
not exceed $25,000, provided the claimant is willing to accept the payment and executes an appropriate settlement
agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Only the authorities designated in paragraph a, above may deny or make a final offer on a claim demanding more than
$25,000. If a claim cannot be settled within the authority of the head of an area claims office or the chief of a command
claims service responsible for investigating a claim, it will be forwarded to USARCS through appropriate channels
with a claims memorandum of opinion recommending disposition.

(a) Title 10, United States Code, Section 4803, provides for agency settlement or compromise of claims for damage
to_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) DA accountable properties of a kind that are within the admiralty jurisdiction of a district court of the United
States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Claims for damage caused by a vessel or floating object to property under the jurisdiction of the DA or property
for which the DA has assumed an obligation to respond in damages, where the net amount payable to the United States does
not exceed $500,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Title 10, United States Code, Section 4804, provides for the settlement of compromise of claims in any amount for
salvage services(including contract salvage and towage) performed by the DA. Claims for salvage services are based
upon labor costs, per diem rates for the use of salvage vessels and other equipment, and upon repair or replacement
costs of materials and equipment damaged or lost during the salvage operation. The sum claimed is intended to compensate
the United States for operational costs only, reserving, however, the right of the Government to assert a claim on
a salvage bonus basis in accordance with commercial practice, in appropriate cases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The United States has three years from the date a maritime claim accrues under this section to file suit against
the responsible parties. The Army's authority to settle or compromise a suit under this section terminates when the
statute of limitations has run. Efforts to compromise a claim under this section should not extend more than two years
past the date the claims accrues unless it is clear that an administrative settlement is likely. As a general rule,
affirmative claims which are likely to be resolved through litigation should be referred to the Department of Justice
within two years of the date the claims accrue.

within the scope of this section will be investigated in accordance with the procedures in subpart B and reported to
the Commander, USARCS. The Commander, USARCS will forward the claim to the Secretary of the Army, the Assistant Secretary
of the Army (Financial Management) as designee to the secretary or other designee of the Secretary who will then certify

USARCS, except in cases where proposed compromise settlement is deemed acceptable and the claim is otherwise within
the authority delegated in &sect;536.132(b).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The authority for this subpart is Article 139, UCMJ (10 U.S.C. 939), which provides for redress for property willfully
damaged or destroyed, or wrongfully taken, by members of the armed forces of the United States.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This subpart sets forth the standards to be applied and the procedures to be followed in the processing of claims for
damage, loss, or destruction of property owned by or in the lawful possession of an individual whether civilian or
military, a business, a charity, or a State or local government, where the property was wrongfully taken or willfully
damaged by military members of DA. Claims cognizable under other claims statutes may be processed under this subpart.

Effect of disciplinary action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Administrative action under Article 139 and this subpart is entirely separate and distinct from disciplinary action
taken under other sections of the UCMJ or other administrative actions. Because action under Article 139 and this
subpart requires independent findings on issues other than guilt or innocence, the mere fact that a soldier was convicted
or acquitted of charges is not dispositive of a claim under Article 139.

Claims cognizable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Claims cognizable under Article 139, UCMJ, are limited to_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Claims for property willfully damaged. Willful damage is damage which is inflicted intentionally, knowingly,
and purposefully without justifiable excuse, as distinguished from damage caused inadvertently or thoughtlessly
through simple or gross negligence. Damage, loss, or destruction of property caused by riotous, violent, or disorderly
acts, or by acts of depredation, or through conduct showing reckless or wanton disregard of the property rights of
others may be considered willful damage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Claims for property wrongfully taken. A wrongful taking is any unauthorized taking or withholding of property,
not involving the breach of a fiduciary or contractual relationship, with the intent to temporarily or permanently
deprive the owner or person lawfully in possession of the property. Damage, loss, or destruction of property through
larceny, forgery, embezzlement fraud, misappropriation, or similar offense may be considered wrongful taking.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Claims not cognizable under this subpart and Article 139 include_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Claims resulting from negligent acts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Claims for personal injury or death.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Claims resulting from acts or omissions of military personnel acting within the scope of their employment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Claims resulting from the conduct of Reserve component personnel who are not subject to the UCMJ at the time of the
offense.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Limitations on assessments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Time Limitations. To be considered, a claim must be submitted within 90 days of the incident out of which the claim
arose, unless the special court-martial convening authority (SPCMCA) acting on the claim determines that good cause
has been shown for the delay.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Limitations on amount. If the General Court-Martial Convening Authority (GCMCA), or designee, acting on the
claim determines that an assessment against a soldier in excess of $10,000 for a single incident is meritorious, he
or she will assess the pay of that soldier in the amount of $10,000 and forward the claim to the Commander, USARCS with
his or her recommendation as to the additional amount that should be assessed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A SPCMCA has authority to approve a pay assessment not to exceed $5,000 on a single incident and deny a claim in any
amount.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A GCMCA, or designee, has authority to approve a pay assessment in an amount not to exceed $10,000 on a single incident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Only the Commander, USARCS, or designee, has authority to approve a pay assessment in an amount greater than $10,000
on a single incident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Direct damages. Assessments are limited to direct damages for the loss or damage to property. Indirect, remote,
or consequential damages may not be considered under this subpart.

Procedure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Area claims offices and claims processing offices with approval authority are responsible for publicizing the Article
139 program and maintaining a log for Article 139 claims presented in their areas (see DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph
10&hyph;6). Area claims offices and claims processing offices with approval authority are required to monitor action
taken on Article 139 claims and ensure that time requirements are met. If assessment action on a particular claim will
be unduly delayed, the office may consider the claim under 31 U.S.C. 3721 and subpart K of this part if it is otherwise
cognizable under that authority. The office will counsel the claimant to repay any overpayment if the Article 139
claim is later successful (see &sect;516.163(d)(1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Form if a claim and presentment. A claim must be presented by the claimant or his or her authorized agent orally or
in writing. The claim must be reduced to writing, signed, and for a definite sum in U.S. dollars within 10 days after
oral presentment. (See &sect;536.20(d)(1)(i))
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Action upon receipt of a claim. Any officer receiving a claim will forward it within 2 working days to the SPCMCA
over the soldier or soldiers against whom the claim is made. If the claim is made against soldiers under the jurisdiction
of more than one such convening authority who are under the same general court-martial convening authority, the claim
will be forwarded to that general court-martial convening authority, who will designate one SPCMCA to investigate
and act on the claim as to all soldiers involved. If the claim is made against soldiers under the jurisdiction of more
than one SPCMCA at different locations and not under the same general court-martial convening authority, the claim
will be forwarded to the SPCMCA whose headquarters is closest to the situs of the incident, who will investigate and
act on the claim as to all soldiers involved. If a claim is made against a member of one of the other Military Services,
the claim will be forwarded to the commander of the nearest MACOM of that Service.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(c) Action by the SPCMCA. (1) If the claim appears to be cognizable, the SPCMCA will appoint an investigating officer
within 4 working days of receipt of a claim. The investigator will use the procedures of this subpart supplemented
by the procedures of AR 15&hyph;6, chapter 4, applicable to informal investigations. The claims officer of a command,
if he or she is a commissioned officer, may be appointed as the investigating officer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the claim is not made against a person who is a member of the armed forces of the United States at the time the claim
is received, or if the claim otherwise does not appear to be cognizable under Article 139, the SPCMCA may refer it for
legal review (see paragraph (e) of this section) within 4 working days of receipt. If, after legal review, the SPCMCA
determines that the claim is not cognizable, he or she may take final action disapproving the claim (see paragraph
(f)) without appointing an investigating officer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Action by the investigating officer. The investigating officer will provide notification to the soldier against
whom the claim is made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If the soldier indicates a desire to make voluntary restitution, the investigating officer may, with the convening
authority's concurrence, delay proceedings until the end of the next pay period to accomplish this. If the soldier
makes payment to the claimant's full satisfaction, the claim will be dismissed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In the absence of full restitution, the investigating officer will determine whether the claim is cognizable
and meritorious under the provisions of Article 139 and this subpart and the amount to be assessed each offender. This
amount will be reduced by any restitution accepted by the claimant from an offender in partial satisfaction. Within
10 working days or such time as the SPCMCA may provide, the investigating officer will make findings and recommendations
and submit these to the SPCMCA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the soldier is absent without leave so that he or she cannot be provided with notification, the Article 139 claim
may be processed in the soldier's absence. If an assessment is approved, a copy of the claim and memorandum authorizing
pay assessment will be forwarded by transmittal letter to the servicing finance and accounting office (FAO) for offset
input against the soldier's pay account. In the event the soldier is dropped from the rolls, the servicing FAO will
forward the assessment documents to Commander, Defense Finance and Accounting Services, ATTN: Military Pay Operations,
Indianapolis, Indiana 46249.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Legal review. The SPCMCA will refer the claim to the area claims office or claims processing office servicing his
or her command to review for legal sufficiency and advice. This will be either after completion of the investigating
officer's report or subsequent to the SPCMCA's decision that the claim is clearly not cognizable (&sect;536.143(c)(2)).
That office will furnish within 5 working days or such time as the SPCMCA will provide a written opinion as to_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Whether the claim is cognizable under the provisions of Article 139 and this subpart.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Whether the findings and recommendations are supported by evidence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Whether there has been substantial compliance with the procedural requirements of Article 139, this subpart,
and AR 15&hyph;6.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Whether the claim is clearly not cognizable (see &sect;536&hyph;143(c)(2)) and final denial action can be taken
without appointing an investigating officer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) If the investigator recommends an assessment more than $5,000, the Judge Advocate/claims attorney will forward
the packet to the head of the area claims office for the legal review. Within 5 working days, the head of the area claims
office will forward the packet, with recommendations, to the GCMCA for approval of an assessment not to exceed $10,000.
If the recommended assessment is over $10,000, the head of the area claims office will then forward the packet to the
Commander, USARCS for final approval of the assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Final action. After considering the advice of the legal advisor, the approval authority will disapprove or approve
the claim in an amount equal to or less than the amount recommended by the investigating officer up to $10,000. The approval
authority will notify the claimant, and any soldier subject to his or her jurisdiction, of the determination and the
right to request reconsideration. (See &sect;536.144.) A copy of the investigating officer's findings and recommendations
will be enclosed with the notice. The approval authority will then suspend action on the claim for 10 working days pending
receipt of a request for reconsideration unless he or she determines that this delay will result in substantial injustice.
The approval authority will direct the servicing finance officer for the soldier against whom assessments are approved
to withhold such amount from the soldier not to exceed $10,000. (See &sect;536.142(b)). For any soldier not subject
to the approval authority's jurisdiction, the approval authority will forward the claim to that commander who does
exercise special court-martial jurisdiction over the soldier for collection action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Assessment. Subject to any limitations provided in appropriate regulations, the servicing finance officer
will withhold the amount directed by the approval authority and pay it to the claimant. The assessment is not subject
to appeal and is conclusive on any finance officer. If the servicing finance officer finds that the required amount
cannot be withheld because he or she does not have custody of the soldier's pay record or because the soldier is in a no
pay due status, the servicing finance officer will promptly notify the approval authority of this in writing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Post settlement action. After action on the claim is completed, the claims office servicing the command which
took final action will retain the original claim file and forward a complete copy of the claim file to the SPCMCA. The
article 139 claim will be filed locally, IAW the Modern Army Record Keeping System (MARKS). If a claim for the same incident
is filed UP AR 27&hyph;20, chapter 11, a copy of the article 139 claim will be incorporated into the subpart K claim file.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Remission of indebtedness. Title 10, United States Code, 4837(d), which authorizes the remission and cancellation
of indebtedness of an enlisted person to the United States or its instrumentalities, is not applicable and may not
be used to remit and cancel indebtedness determined as a result of action under Article 139.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) General. Although Article 139 does not provide for a right of appeal, either the claimant or a soldier whose pay
is assessed may request the SPCMCA or a successor in command to reconsider the action. A request for reconsideration
will be submitted in writing and will clearly state the factual or legal basis for the relief requested. The SPCMCA
may direct that the matter be reinvestigated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Reconsideration by the original SPCMCA. The original SPCMCA may reconsider the action so long as he or she occupies
that position, regardless of whether a soldier whose pay was assessed has been transferred. The original SPCMCA may
modify it if he or she determines that the action was incorrect, subject to paragraph (d) of this section. However,
the SPCMCA should only modify the action on the basis of fraud, substantial new evidence, errors in calculation, or
mistake of law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Reconsideration by a successor in command. Subject to paragraph (d) of this section, a successor in command may
only modify an action on the basis of fraud, substantial new evidence, errors in calculation, or mistake of law apparent
on the face of the record.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Legal review and action. Prior to modifying the original action, the SPCMCA will have the claims office render
a legal opinion and fully explain the basis for modification as part of the file. If a return of assessed pay is deemed
appropriate, the SPCMCA should request the claimant to return the money, setting forth the basis for the request.
There is no authority for repayment from appropriated funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Disposition of files. After completing action on reconsideration, the SPCMCA will forward the reconsideration
action to the claims office who will then file the action IAW &sect;536.143(h).

Form of claims.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) A claim normally will be presented in writing. A report of the incident to the authorities stated in &sect;536.149
by the claimant or agent requesting compensation is an adequate presentation. Under unusual circumstances, a claim
presented orally by the claimant to U.S. authorities may be considered acceptable. An oral claim must be reduced to
writing, however, not more than 3 years after the date on which it accrues. The written claim must state the time, place,
and nature of the incident; the nature and extent of damage, loss, or injury; and the amount of compensation claimed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A claim will be stated in the currency of the country where the incident occurred, or the country where the claimant
was an inhabitant at the time of the incident. The U.S. dollar equivalent of a foreign currency, computed at the time
the claim is filed and based on the annual Foreign Currency Fluctuation Account exchange rate (where applicable),
will determine whether a foreign claims commission has monetary jurisdiction to settle the claim. (See &sect;536.149.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Claims commissions and command claims service will coordinate informally with the Chief, Special Claims Branch,
USARCS to determine whether it is necessary to comply with the mirror file requirements of &sect;536.21 (c) and (d),
for any claim cognizable under this subpart in which the amount claimed is greater than $50,000 and a foreign government
is not responsible for adjudication under a SOFA or other agreement.

Claimants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) General. (1) In personal injury or property damage cases, a claimant must have been an inhabitant of a foreign country
at the time of the incident and not otherwise excluded as a claimant. In a wrongful death case, the proper claimants
are those who are entitled by the law of the country where the incident occurred to bring a claim for the decedent's death,
and the decedent must have been an inhabitant of a foreign country at the time of the incident and not otherwise excluded
as a claimant. However, it is not necessary that the claimant in personal injury and property damage cases, or the decedent
in a death case, be a citizen of, or have legal domicile in the foreign country, to establish that he or she is an inhabitant
thereof.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A corporation or other organization doing business in a foreign country on a permanent basis may qualify as a proper
claimant although organized under U.S. law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) United States citizens residing overseas may be proper claimants provided it is established that they actually
are inhabitants of a foreign country (see paragraph 7&hyph;4c(1)(a), DA Pam 27&hyph;162) and are not otherwise excluded.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The government of a foreign country and political subdivisions thereof are proper claimants unless waiver provisions
of applicable international agreements exclude such claims.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Claimants excluded. (1) A national, or a corporation controlled by a national, of a country at war or engaged in
armed conflict with the United States or of any country allied with such enemy country, is excluded as a claimant, unless
the appropriate foreign claims commission considering the claim or the responsible military commander, determines
that the claimant is, and at the time of the incident was, friendly to the United States.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) United States military personnel and civilian employees of the U.S. Government or its agencies and instrumentalities
and their dependents, who are normally residents of the United States and who, at the time of the incident giving rise
to the claim, are residing in a foreign country primarily because of their own or their sponsor's duty or employment
status, are not foreign inhabitants and are excluded from coverage under the Foreign Claims Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Foreign born spouses, children and other dependent family members of such military personnel and United States
employees are also deemed to be inhabitants of the United States and excluded from coverage under this subpart if they
have resided with their sponsor in the United States and are now overseas primarily because of their sponsor's duty
assignment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Children born to or adopted by a member of the force or civilian component who has not been reassigned to the United
States since the date of the birth or adoption, are deemed to be an inhabitant of the United States and excluded from
coverage under this subpart from the time they are born or adopted. However, children born or adopted overseas will
be deemed to be foreign inhabitants if there is clear evidence that they are not a member of the sponsor's household
and are not residing overseas primarily because of the sponsors duty assignment. For example, a child born or adopted
overseas would be deemed to be a foreign inhabitant if the child continued to reside overseas with the other parent
after their military or civilian employee sponsor returns to the United States or is transferred to another foreign
country on permanent change of station orders. (See paragraph 7&hyph;4c, DA Pam 27&hyph;162.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) In the case of a spouse married overseas to a member of the armed forces or a U.S. civilian employee, the spouse
continues to be a foreign inhabitant until he or she moves with the sponsor to another foreign country or to the United
States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Parents or other relatives who are financially dependent on a member of the military or civilian employee, but
are not members of the household, continue to be foreign inhabitants. If they are members of the sponsor's household
they lose foreign inhabitant status once they have resided in the United States or another foreign country with the
sponsor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Other residents of the United States, or its territories, commonwealths, or possessions who are visiting, touring,
or employed overseas, but not inhabitants of a foreign country, are excluded.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Insurers or other subrogees. (1) Under this subpart the property claim of an insured, but not that of a subrogee,
may be considered. This precludes consideration of the claim of an insurer subrogated by operation of law or the terms
of a policy of insurance for payments made by it to or for its insured. However, an insured party will not be required
to exhaust a remedy against an insurer, which the insured obtained by payment of a premium to that insurer, prior to
payment of a property damage claim under this subpart.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Further, no claim or any part thereof, the amount of which has been recovered or is reasonably recoverable from
workmen's compensation, health insurance, social security, or any indemnifying law or indemnity contract, may
be paid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Provisions of paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section are intended to preclude any payment that does not go to
and remain with the injured party claimant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If the application of paragraph (c)(2) of this section would impose severe hardship upon an individual, the claim
should be forwarded to Commander, USARCS, who is authorized to make exceptions in individual cases upon presentation
of adequate justification.

where the incident occurred. Claims arising from the operation of U.S. Armed Forces vehicles or other equipment by
the employees described in the preceding sentence, however, may be paid, even though the employees are not acting
within the scope of their employment, provided the employer or owner of the vehicle or other equipment would be liable
under local law in the circumstances involved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Officers or civilian employees of the American Battle Monuments Commission, acting within the scope of employment.
Claims generated by such personnel will be paid from American Battle Monuments Commission appropriations.

A claim may not be allowed under this subpart that_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Results from action by an enemy or results directly or indirectly from an act of the armed forces of the United States
in combat, except if it arises from an accident or malfunction incident to the operation of an aircraft of the armed
forces of the United States including its airborne ordnance, indirectly related to combat, and occurring while preparing
for, going to, or returning from a combat mission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Is purely contractual in nature.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Is one for which a foreign country is responsible under Article VIII NATO&hyph;SOFA, or other similar treaty or
agreement. (See &sect;536.148). However, if a foreign country refuses to recognize legal responsibility for the
claim, or to consider it under applicable treaty provisions, the senior Army JA in country or, where the estimated
value of the claim is within USARCS authority, the Commander, USARCS, may authorize a foreign claims commission to
consider the claim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Arises from private or domestic obligations as distinguished from Government transactions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Is based solely on compassionate grounds. (See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 8&hyph;4.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Is a bastardy claim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Is for the personal injury or death of a Government employee for whom benefits are provided by the FECA (5 U.S.C.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(k) Is for the personal injury or death of any employee for whom benefits are provided under workmen's compensation
type laws or regulations, including local law or custom, in cases where contribution is made or insurance premiums
paid directly or indirectly by the United States on behalf of the injured employee. If, in the opinion of a foreign claims
commission the claim should be considered payable; (e.g. injuries did not result from the normal risk of employment
or adequate compensation is not payable under workmen's compensation laws,) the file will be forwarded with recommendations
through claims channels to the Commander, USARCS, who may authorize payment of an appropriate award. The Commander,
USARCS, also may specify that all or any part of any compensation received by the claimant from workmen's compensation
sources, as above, will be deducted from the award to claimant. The claim of an insurance carrier subrogee who has received
premiums paid directly or indirectly by the United States on behalf of the injured employee, however, is not payable.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(l) Is for taking of property by technical trespass, such as the overflight of aircraft or a taking contemplated by
the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, as distinguished from common law trespass. (See AR 405&hyph;15, paragraph
2c, and DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraphs 8&hyph;46 and 8&hyph;75).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

of his or her immediate family such as articles acquired to be disposed of as gifts or for sale to another, voluntarily
bailed to the Army, or for precious jewels and other articles of extraordinary value voluntarily bailed to the DA.
The preceding sentence is not applicable to claims involving registered or insured mail. No allowance will be made
for any item when the evidence indicates that the acquisition, possession, or transportation thereof was in violation
of DA directives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(p) Is for rent, damage, or other payments involving the acquisition, use, possession, or disposition of real property
or interests therein by and for the DA, except as authorized by &sect;536.152(c)(1). Real estate claims founded upon

loan sharking. When a claim is considered to be not payable for the reasons stated in this paragraph, the issue will
be presented to the Commander, USARCS for determination of the applicability of this exclusion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(t) Is based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty
on the part of a Federal agency, or a member or employee of the Army, whether or not the discretion involved is abused.
However, this exception should not be used without prior approval of the Commander, USARCS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(u) Arises in respect to the assessment or collection of any tax or custom duty, or the detention of any goods or merchandise

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(w) Is a claim arising out of an act or omission of any employee of the Government in administering the provisions of
the Trading With the Enemy Act (50 U.S.C. App, sections 1&hyph;31). (See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 8&hyph;8d.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(x) Is for damages caused by the imposition or establishment of a quarantine by the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(y) Results wholly from the negligent or wrongful act of the claimant or his or her agent. Claims involving comparative
negligence are not barred by this provision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(z) Arises out of malicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, deceit, or interference
with contract rights.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(aa) Is for damages caused by the fiscal operations of the DA, the Treasury, or by regulation of the monetary system.

Compensation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) In determining an appropriate award, the law and custom of the country where the incident occurred will be used
to determine what elements of damages are payable and which individuals are entitled to receive compensation. However,
where the claimant is an inhabitant of another foreign country and only temporarily in the country where the incident
occurred, the quantum of certain elements of damages, such as lost wages and future medical care, may be calculated
based on the law and economic conditions in the country of the claimant's permanent residence. Punitive damages and
interest will not be allowed. Court costs, attorney fees, bail, costs of filing a claim, and similar charges also are
not allowed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Local law or custom pertaining to contributory or comparative negligence and to joint tortfeasors will be applied.

Computation of amount.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The amount allowed will, to the extent possible, be apportioned among claimants as prescribed by local law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) After appropriate compensation for the total damages suffered has been computed, any payment claimant has received
from the tortfeasor, or any joint tortfeasor, will be deducted. This includes amounts collectible from a tortfeasor's
or joint tortfeasor's insurance company or amounts paid by any other third party.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Deductions for insurance. (1) Normally there will be deducted from any award the amount of any applicable insurance
coverage recovered or an amount that can be reasonably expected to be recovered and which has been or will be paid to
the claimant. In this regard, every effort will be made to monitor the insurance aspect of the case and encourage direct
settlement between the claimant and the insurer. (See &sect;536.151(c)(1).)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When efforts under paragraph (c)(1) of this section are of no avail or it otherwise is determined that an insurance
settlement will not be reasonably available for application to the award, settlement may be accomplished without
making a deduction. In such cases, an assignment of the insured's rights against the insurer will be obtained and,
in appropriate cases, reimbursement action will be instituted against the insurer under applicable procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the reason that an insurance settlement is not available is due to insolvency or bankruptcy of the insurer, no
award will be made until prior consent has been obtained from the Commander, USARCS. In this event, a report on a bankruptcy
will be forwarded without delay setting forth all pertinent information including the alleged reasons for the bankruptcy
and the facts concerning the licensing of the insurer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Settlements will be stated in the appropriate foreign currency. To determine the proper approval authority,
the settlement or the claimed amount (in claims where a settlement cannot be reached) will be converted to the U.S.
dollar equivalent (based on the annual Foreign Currency Fluctuation Account exchange rate, where applicable) on
the date of the commission's action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Payment will be made in the currency of the country in which the incident occurred or where the claimant resided
at the time of the incident. However, if the claimant resides in another foreign country at the time of payment, payment
in an amount equivalent to that which would have been paid under the preceding sentence may be made in the currency of
that third country.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) No more than 20% of the total cost of an award to the United States may be paid as attorney fees or as a fee by any representative.
This fee limitation should be made a part of all settlement agreements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) In appropriate cases, a commission or other approval authority can require a structured settlement with periodic
or deferred payments if it is feasible to make such arrangements in the country where the claimants reside. Such settlement
are especially appropriate on claims of minors. In cases where the time, duration, amount or need for any element of
future damages is uncertain, the part of the award for such damages may be paid into a reversionary trust with the reversion
to the United States.

(a) Claims cognizable under this section will be referred to a foreign claims commission for processing regardless
of the amount claimed. The commander senior Judge Advocate of a command having a command claims service will appoint
necessary foreign claims commissions to acton claims arising within his or her geographic area jurisdiction, and
on claims arising in another geographic area jurisdiction that are transferred by agreement between the commanders
involved. The senior Judge Advocate may delegate this authority to commander or chief of the command claims service.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) All other commissions will be appointed by the Commander, USARCS, to act on any claims referred to the commission
regardless of where the claim arose. Commissions appointed by the Commander, USARCS, for units based on CONUS may
act on any claim arising out of the operations of their unit. Any claims commission operating in or adjudicating claims
arising out of an area within the jurisdiction of a command claims service will comply with the legal and procedural
guidance of that service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) A commission may operate as an integral part of a command claims service that will determine the cases to be assigned
to it, furnish necessary administrative services, and establish and maintain its records. Where a commission does
not operate as a part of a command claims service, it may operate as a part of the office of a division, corps or higher
command SJA, who will perform the foregoing functions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Any appointing authority may relieve a commission appointed by him or her. One copy of each order concerning appointment,
relief, or change of responsibility of a commission will be forwarded without delay to the Commander, USARCS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Normally, the claims commission is responsible for the investigation of all claims referred to it, using the procedures
in subpart B, Investigation, and any local procedures established by the appointing authority or command claims
service responsible for the area in which the claim arose. The chief of a command claims service can request assistance
on claims investigation in their geographical areas from units or organizations other than the claims commission.
The Commander, USARCS can do likewise for any claim referred to a commission appointed under his authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) When a foreign claims commission intends to deny a claim, award less than the amount claimed, or recommend an award
less that the amount claimed but in excess of its authority, it will notify the claimant, the claimant's authorized
agent, or the claimant's legal representative, in writing by the means most likely to ensure receipt by the claimant,
of its intended action on the claim and the legal and factual basis for that action. The purpose of this notice is to give
the claimant an opportunity to object to the commission's action and state the reasons for the objection before final
action on the claim. Where the commission intends to award the amount claimed or to recommend to higher authority an
award equal to the amount claimed, this procedure is not necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) This notice should be given at least 30 days prior to final action by the commission, except for small claims processed
under the provisions of Subpart B, Small Claims.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the commission proposes to make a partial award or to recommend a partial award to higher authority, a settlement
agreement should be enclosed with the notice. If the commission is recommending an award in excess of its authority,
the agreement should indicate that the recommendation is contingent upon approval by higher authority. Claimants
will be advised they may either accept the commission's action by returning the signed settlement agreement or, if
they are dissatisfied with the commission's action or recommendation, they may submit a response in writing stating
the factual or legal reasons why they believe the commissions proposed action is incorrect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A commission may alter its initial decision based on the claimant's response or proceed with its intended action.
If the claimant's response raises a general policy issue, the commission may request an advisory opinion from the
Commander, USARCS while retaining the claim for final action at its level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Upon completion of its evaluation of the claimant's response, the commission will notify the claimant of its final
decision and advise the claimant that its action is final and conclusive by law (10 U.S.C. 2735), unless the final decision
is a recommendation for payment above its authority. In that case, the commission will forward any response submitted
by the claimant along with the commission's claims memorandum of opinion to the approval authority and will notify
the claimant accordingly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Every reasonable effort should be made to negotiate a mutually agreeable settlement on meritorious claims. When
an agreement can be reached, the notice and response provisions above are not necessary. If the commission recommends
an award in excess of it authority, the settlement agreement should indicate that its recommendation is contingent
upon approval by higher authority.

A foreign claims commission normally will be composed of either one or three members. Alternate members of three-member
commissions may be appointed where circumstances require and be substituted for regular members for specific cases
by order of the appointing authority. The appointing orders will clearly state who is to designate the president of
a three-member commission. Two members of a three-member commission will constitute a quorum, and the commission
decision will be determined by majority vote.

A member of a foreign claims commission normally will be either a commissioned officer or a claims attorney. At least
two members of a three-member commission must be JAs or claims attorneys. In exigent circumstances, a qualified non-lawyer
employee of the armed forces may be appointed to a foreign claims commission subject to prior approval by the Commander,
USARCS. Such approval may be granted only upon a showing of the employee's status and qualifications and adequate
justification of the need for such appointment (for example, lack of legally qualified personnel). The commission
will be limited to employees who are citizens of the United States. An officer, claims attorney, or employee of another
armed force will be appointed a member of an Army foreign claims commission only if approved by the Commander, USARCS.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) One-member commission. Unless otherwise restricted by the appointing authority, a one-member foreign claims
commission that is a JA or a claims attorney may consider and pay appropriate claims presented in any amount provided
a mutually agreed settlement can be reached in an amount not over $15,000 or disapprove any claim presented in an amount
not over $15,000. In no case will the jurisdictional limit of $15,000 be used to unfairly reduce payment of a claim meritorious
in an amount over $15,000. Any other one-member foreign claims commission may consider and pay, in full or in part,
claims presented in an amount not exceeding $2,500 that it considers meritorious.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Three-member commission. A three-member commission may take the following actions on a claim properly before
the commission, unless otherwise restricted by the appointing authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Disapprove a claim presented in any amount. Where a claim presented in any amount over $50,000 is disapproved,
the commission, after final action has been taken, will forward to the appointing authority the written notice to
the claimant required by &sect;536.157(f), any response by the claimant and its notice of final action on the claim.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Approve and pay, in full or in part, a claim filed in any amount which is adjudicated by the commission as meritorious
in an amount not exceeding $50,000. For claims in excess of $50,000 in which the commission approves payment of an award
for $50,000 or less, the commission, after taking final action, will forward to the appointing authority the written
notice to the claimant required by &sect;536.157(f), any response by the claimant and its notice of final action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Recommend an award in excess of $50,000. The commission will comply with the notice and comment provisions of &sect;536.157(f),
and forward the claim to the approval authority under cover of a claims memorandum of opinion. Recommendations for
awards in excess of the commissions authority will be sent through any command claims service responsible for the
area in which the claim arose and, in the case of recommendations for awards in excess of $100,000, through the Commander,
USARCS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) In any case where no claim exceeds $50,000 but the total amount to be awarded on all claims arising out of the same
incident exceeds $100,000, no action will be taken to make payment until a claims memorandum of opinion (see &sect;536.22)
on the incident has been forwarded and reviewed by the Commander, USARCS or his designee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) TJAG, TAJAG and the Commander, USARCS or his designee at USARCS may approve and pay, in whole or in part, any claims
so long as the amount of the award does not exceed $100,000; may disapprove any claims, regardless of either the amount
claimed or the recommendation of the commission forwarding the claim; or, if a claim is forwarded to USARCS for approval
of payment in excess of $50,000, may refer the claim back to the commission or to another commission for further action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Payments in excess of $100,000 will be approved by the Secretary of the Army, the Assistant Secretary of the Army
(Financial Management) as designee of the Secretary or other designee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Following approval, where required, and receipt of an agreement by the claimant accepting the specific sum awarded
by the commission, the claim will be processed for payment in the appropriate currency. The first $100,000 of any award
will be paid from Army claims funds. The excess will be reported to the Claims Division, GAO, 441 G Street, NW., WASH
DC 20548&hyph;9100, together with the documents listed in 536.35(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) The chief of an overseas command claims service may delegate to a one-member commission the responsibility for
the receipt, processing, and investigation of any claim, regardless of amount, except those required to be referred
to a receiving state office for adjudication under the provisions of a treaty concerning the status of our forces in
the country where the claim arose. If, after investigation, it appears that action by a three-member commission is
appropriate, the one-member commission should send the claim to the three-member commission with a complete investigation
report to include a discussion of the applicable local law and a recommendation for disposition.

advance payment is authorized if the incident occurs in a foreign country which, pursuant to the NATO&hyph;SOFA or
other similar threat or agreement, is responsible for the settlement of claims arising therein. An advance payment
may be made in a nonscope claim.

Scope.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) This subpart prescribes the substantive bases and special procedural rules for the administrative settlement
of claims against the United States submitted by the Active Army, ARNG, and USAR personnel, and civilian employees
of DOD and DA for damage to or loss of personal property incident to their service. This subpart also sets forth procedures
for the administrative recovery from responsible third parties for loss, damage, or destruction of such personal
property. The underlying Act is a gratuitous payment statute; claims thereunder do not sound in tort even though some
tort concepts are used in the adjudication of claims under this subpart. Further, the Act is not designed to make the
United States a total insurer of the personal property of proper claimants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The maximum amount that may be paid for any loss or damage arising from a single incident is limited by the Act as amended
by Pub. L. 100&hyph;565, 31 October 1988, to $40,000. The maximum limit of $40,000 is specifically limited to losses
of personal property occurring after 31 October 1988, and to losses resulting from evacuations or from hostile acts
directed against the United States or its officers and employees. A maximum limit of $25,000 is applicable to losses
of personnel property occurring after 28 July 1982 and before 1 November 1988.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Any claim within the scope of this subpart, which otherwise would be cognizable under the MCA and subpart C; the
FTCA and subpart E; the Act of 9 October 1962 (10 U.S.C. 2737) and subpart E; the NGCA and subpart F; the Maritime Claims
Settlement Act and subpart H; or the FCA and subpart J will first be considered under this subpart.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If not payable under this subpart, the claim will be considered under the other subparts prior to any disapproval.
Particular attention should be given to the nature of the claim; many alleged ``unusual occurrences'' are actually
torts, either by employees or by individuals in their private capacities. While some incidents may not seem common
to those experiencing them, an ``unusual occurrence'' is defined as an occurrence beyond the normal risk associated
with day-to-day living and working. An unusual occurrence does not involve a reasonably foreseeable consequence
of normal human activity. For example, having a vehicle hit by a golf ball while driving by a golf course or struck by
an unknown vehicle in a parking lot is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of driving a vehicle.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If a claim cognizable under this subpart arises from an incident resulting in personal injury, no payment or emergency
partial payment will be made under this subpart until an investigation completed in accordance with &sect;&sect;536.19
and 536.20 has been conducted. The Commander, USARCS, Chief, Personnel Claims and Recovery Division, or the chief
of a command claims service may waive this requirement. Prior to payment the investigation must establish that the
incident was not caused by the negligence of the claimant or an agent of the claimant. An example of such an incident
would be a fire in quarters that results in an injury to a soldier's family member and was presumably caused by faulty
wiring, but might have been caused by the claimant's negligence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Any claim within the scope of this subpart which is also cognizable under Article 139 will first be considered under
subpart I. If settlement of the Article 139 claim will be unduly protracted, the claim may be settled under this subpart
and the claimant counseled to repay any overpayment if payment is later received under the provisions of subpart I.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Any claim cognizable under this subpart that is primarily the result of fault or negligence of a Government contractor
other than a common carrier or warehouse firm will first be referred to the contractor or his or her insurer for settlement
in accordance with DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 2&hyph;6.

the provisions of this subpart. The completed file will contain all required supporting documents, including evidence
in support of the amount claimed and documents facilitating recovery from a carrier, insurer, or other third party.
Such claims will be forwarded direct to the nearest legal office of the service concerned for settlement. However,
Marine personnel claims should be forwarded directly to the Commandant of the Marine Corps (MHP&hyph;40), Headquarters,
United States Marine Corps, WASH DC 20380&hyph;0001.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following are nonexclusive examples of categories of damage to or loss of property that may be considered by claims
approval and settlement authorities as having been sustained incident to service. Note that a loss unconnected with
the performance of duty, particularly a loss occurring outside of normal duty hours, would often not be deemed incident
to a civilian employee's service, even though the same loss might be deemed incident to a soldier's service. This is
particularly true if the civilian employee is a local foreign national employee. A claims approval or settlement
authority will ask the Chief, Personnel Claims and Recovery Division, USARCS for an advance opinion prior to adjudicating
a claim that is deemed incident to service but does not fall within one of the following categories:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Losses in quarters or other authorized places. Damage to or loss of property by fire, flood, hurricane, or other
unusual occurrence, or by theft or vandalism may be considered, while located at_

(i) A civilian employee who is a local inhabitant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A U.S. citizen hired as a civilian employee while residing abroad or after moving to a foreign country as part of
the household of a person who is not a proper party claimant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A family member residing outside the United States while the soldier is stationed in a different country.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) A local inhabitant of a U.S. territory who is in that territory at the time of a loss when he or she is in the ARNG either

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

other parts in fit condition and to load the mobile home to withstand the stress of normal transportation, at his or
her own expense, prior to shipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Action by the claimant in an attempt to quiet a civil disturbance or alleviate a public disaster.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Efforts by the claimant to save a human life or Government property.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Evacuation from a foreign country on the recommendation or order of competent authority. This subsection provides
payment for property belonging to soldiers and civilian employees and their command-sponsored dependents, with
entitlement to shipment at Government expense, which is abandoned during an evacuation and not recovered, or damaged
by an incident of political unrest or hostile act prompting or following such evacuation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Loss of money delivered to a Government agent. Loss of funds neither applied as directed by the owner nor returned
may be considered when the funds were delivered to and accepted by Government personnel authorized or apparently
authorized to receive them for such purposes as safekeeping; deposit in savings deposit program; transmission by
personal transfer account; purchase of U.S. bonds or postal money orders; or conversion into military payment orders,
Government checks, or into another kind of currency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Vehicle losses. Vehicles are defined to include automobiles, motorcycles, mopeds, utility trailers, camping
trailers, trucks with mounted camper bodies, motor homes, boats, boat trailers, bicycles, and aircraft. Mobile
homes and other property used as dwelling places are not considered vehicles. Damage to or loss of vehicles and property
properly stored or contained therein may be considered when_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Used in the performance of military duty, if such use was authorized or directed for the convenience of the Government
and provided_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The travel did not include commuting to or from the permanent place of duty and,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The loss or damage did not arise as a result of a mechanical or structural failure of the vehicle during such usage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Shipped to, from, or between an overseas area or areas at Government expense in accordance with paragraph (b) of
this section, provided the loss or damage did not arise as a result of mechanical or structural failure of the vehicle
during such shipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Located at quarters or place of lodging as defined in paragraphs (a) (1), (2), and (3) of this section, which for
the purposes of this paragraph includes garages, carports, driveways, assigned parking spaces, and lots specifically
provided and used for the purpose of parking at one's quarters, provided that the loss or damage is caused by fire, flood,
hurricane, or other unusual occurrence, or by theft or vandalism. There is a presumption that vehicle theft or vandalism
occurs off the military installation and is generally not compensable. Claims for theft or vandalism to vehicles
(including property stored inside a vehicle) are only payable when a claimant proves that the theft or vandalism occurred
while the vehicle was located at his or her authorized or assigned quarters (for example, a military police report
indicates broken glass from the window is on the driveway).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Located other than at quarters on a military installation, provided that the loss or damage is caused by fire, flood,
hurricane, or other unusual occurrence. The term ``military installation'' is used broadly to describe any fixed
land area, wherever situated, controlled, and used by military activities or the DOD. A vehicle that is properly on
the installation should be presumed to be incident to the claimant's service unless the application of such a presumption
would be unreasonable under the particular circumstances, such as visiting a fellow soldier on another military
installation while on leave.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Clothing and articles being worn. Damage to or loss of clothing and articles being worn while on a military installation
or in the performance of military duty may be considered, provided such loss was caused by fire, flood, hurricane,
or other unusual occurrence, or by theft. Spilling battery acid, paint or similar substances on clothing, or breaking
eyeglasses during physical training is not an unusual occurrence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Personal property held as evidence. Deprivation of property held as evidence may be considered when after taking
all circumstances into consideration, the temporary loss of the property will work a grave hardship on the claimant
who is a victim of a crime.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) On-post robberies. Claims for losses due to theft from the person on a military installation by the use of force,
violence, or threat to do bodily harm may be considered. If cognizable under Article 139, the claims should be considered
under subpart I.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following are examples of types and categories of property losses for which compensation will not be allowed:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Property lost or damaged as a result of claimant's negligence. Property damaged or lost, in whole or in part, as
a result of any negligence or wrongful act of the claimant, the claimant's spouse or family member, or any agent or employee
of the claimant acting in the scope of employment, is not compensable. Negligence may be defined as failure to exercise
the degree of care that a reasonable and prudent person would have exercised under the same circumstances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Property damaged or lost while located at quarters within the United States that were occupied by the claimant
but were neither assigned nor otherwise provided in kind by the Government.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Intangible property. Loss of property that has no extrinsic and marketable value but is merely representative
or evidence of value, such as non-negotiable stock certificates, promissory notes, bonds, bills of lading, warehouse
receipts, insurance policies, baggage checks, and bank books is not compensable. Similarly, a claimant may not be
compensated for the inability to use nonrefundable tickets or recover lease or utility deposits. Loss of a thesis,
or other similar item, is compensable only to the extent of the out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the claimant in
preparing the item such as the cost of the paper or other materials. No compensation is authorized for the time spent
by the claimant in its preparation or for supposed literary value.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Incidental expenses and consequential damages. The Act and this subpart authorize payment for loss of or damage
to personal property only. Except as provided in &sect;536.165, consequential damages or other types of loss or incidental
expenses (such as loss of use, interest, carrying charges, cost of lodging or food while awaiting arrival of shipment,
attorney fees, telephone calls, cost of transporting claimant or family members, inconvenience, time spent in preparation
of claim, or cost of insurance premiums) are not compensable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Real property. Damage to real property is not compensable. In determining whether an item is considered to be an
item of personal property, as opposed to real property, normally, any movable item is considered personal property
even if physically joined to the land.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Articles acquired or held for sale or disposition by other commercial transactions on more than an occasional
basis, or for use in a private profession or business enterprise.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Enemy property or war trophies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Property acquired, possessed, or transported unlawfully or in violation of local law or competent regulations
or directives. This includes loss or damage to vehicles not properly registered or insured in compliance with local
law or competent regulations or directives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Loss of money in any amount during shipment or storage with baggage or household goods. This includes coin collections.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) Property stored at a commercial facility for the convenience of the claimant and at his or her expense.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(k) Substantial fraud. The head of an area claims office may completely deny a claim that he determines to be substantially
tainted by fraud.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(l) Not a proper claimant. See &sect;&sect;536.164 and 536.165(a)(2).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) No claim may be paid under this subpart unless it is presented in writing within 2 years after it accrues. A claim
is presented when it is received at a U.S. military establishment, not when it enters the mails. For purposes of this
subpart, a claim accrues at the time of the incident causing the loss or damage, or at such time as the loss or damage is
or should have been discovered by the claimant through the exercise of due diligence. In the case of multiple deliveries
on the same Government Bill of Lading, the claim accrues for those later received items when they are delivered. The
claim filed for the initial damage will be amended to reflect the subsequently claimed items. If personal property
remains in storage after the expiration date of legal entitlement to storage at Governmental expense, a claim normally
accrues on such expiration date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If a claim accrues in time of war or armed conflict in which the Armed Forces of the United States are engaged, or if
such a war or armed conflict intervenes within 2 years after the claim accrues, and if good cause is shown, then the claim
may be presented not later than 2 years after the war or armed conflict is terminated. A claims office may telephonically
obtain the authority to grant additional time to file a claim, from the Chief, Personnel Claims and Recovery Division.
If good cause for delay in filing is not established, the intervention of war or armed conflict, in itself, will not
permit payment of a claim presented later than 2 years after accrual. Pursuant to the provisions of Pub. L. 96&hyph;446
(94 Stat 1967), periods of captivity are excluded in computing the 2-year statute of limitations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If a proper party claimant is notified that his or her personal property in nontemporary storage has sustained
partial damage, the statute of limitations does not begin to run until the claimant has an opportunity to ascertain
the extent of the loss, or the claimant's entitlement to Government shipment or storage expires, whichever occurs
sooner. However, the claimant is expected to exercise due diligence in attempting to ascertain the extent of the loss.
Moreover, when a proper party claimant is notified that his or her personal property in nontemporary storage at Government
expense has sustained complete destruction or loss, the statute of limitations begins to run when this notification
is received.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Claims personnel will date-stamp, log in and consider as a personnel claim any writing received at a U.S. military
establishment if it constitutes a demand for compensation for loss of or damage to personal property. Claims personnel
will not return such writing to the claimant without action as ``lacking documentation'' and may only consider it
abandoned in accordance with &sect;536.234(a). For claims cognizable under this subpart, a demand need not be for
a specified sum of money. However, the claimant must complete and submit DD Form 1842 and DD Form 1844 (List of Property
and Claim Analysis Chart) as a condition precedent to payment of the claim. Claimants will be required to complete
only one DD Form 1842 and DD Form 1844 and to provide only one copy of supporting documentation. A demand on carrier,
warehouse firm, insurer, or other third party is not considered a claim against the United States. Submission of DD
Form 1840R (Notice of Loss or Damage) to the claims office does not constitute presentment of a claim. If, however,
a claimant alleges that he or she filed a claim, and the evidence shows that within the 2-year period the claimant visited
a claims office of one of the Armed Forces with an apparent desire to obtain compensation, it may be presumed in absence
of evidence to the contrary, that the claimant, in fact, submitted a claim.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) A claim should, if practicable, be submitted in writing to the claims office serving the Active Army installation
where the claimant is stationed or nearest to the point where the loss or damage occurred, or where investigation of
the facts and circumstances can most conveniently be made. ARNG and USAR personnel will not file claims with their
unit but with the nearest Active Army installation. If submission in accordance with the foregoing is impracticable
under the circumstances, the claim may be submitted in writing to the commander for any installation or establishment
of the Armed Forces who will forward the claim to the appropriate Army claims office for processing. To constitute
a filing under this regulation, a claim must be presented in writing to an agency of one of the military departments
other than the National Guard or a Reserve Component.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The claimant is responsible for substantiating ownership or possession, the fact of loss or damage, and the value
of property, especially for expensive items. The claimant is also responsible for promptly discovering and reporting
loss whenever failure to do so would prejudice either effective investigation of the claim or effective recovery
action from a third party. Failure to do so may result in reduction of the amount allowable or denial of the claim in accordance
with &sect;536.181(a).

(a) The prompt, fair disposition of claims of soldiers and civilians, consistent with the protection of the interests
of the Government, is necessary to maintain morale and to prevent financial hardship. Claims approval and settlement
authorities should exercise reasonable discretion in the consideration of claims to achieve this goal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The small claims procedures (subpart B, small claims) applicable to claims that may be settled by payment of $1,000
or less without extensive investigation should be used to the maximum extent feasible. When this procedure is used,
every reasonable effort should be made to settle the claim within the shortest possible period, usually one working
day. However, the small claims procedure should not be used when additional investigation is necessary to develop
the facts required for an informed disposition of the claim regardless of the amount claimed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Within the DA, personnel claims will not be transferred except as authorized by the USARCS or a command claims service.
(See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 2&hyph;55.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) When it is necessary to disapprove a claim or to allow a sum less than the amount claimed, the claimant must be informed
either orally or in writing of the factual or legal basis for the decision. The first must reflect that this explanation
was provided to the claimant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) When a claimant refuses to provide information concerning private insurance coverage, the JA may assume, in the
absence of evidence to the contrary, that the claimant had private insurance covering the entire loss and disapprove
the claim.

Prior to allowing or recommending the allowance of compensation for the loss, damage, or destruction of property,
the approval or settlement authority will make the following findings:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The claimant is a proper party claimant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The evidence substantiates the fact of ownership or possession of the personal property involved and the fact
of loss, damage, or destruction as alleged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The loss, damage, or destruction of the property involved was sustained incident to the claimant's military service
or employment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The type of property claimed and the amount or quantity claimed was reasonable or useful under the attendant circumstances
for the claimant to have used or possessed incident to military service or employment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) There is no bar to the allowance of compensation of the type of property involved, or for the type of loss, damage,
or destruction providing the basis of the claim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) The claimant certified that no part of the loss is covered by insurance. If private insurance covers any part of
the loss, the claimant must first settle with the insurance company. See section 536.181(b)(5). (Coverage under
most personal property insurance carried by service personnel includes items lost or missing, destroyed, or damaged
by water while in custody of a public carrier.)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) For claims of losses incident to service processed under this subpart or subpart L, the Commander, USARCS, will
periodically publish an allowance List_Depreciation Guide specifying rates of depreciation and maximum payments
applicable to categories of property. The Allowance List_Depreciation Guide will be binding on all Army claims personnel.
(See section 536.9(f).) For claims for losses incident to service processed under this subpart or subpart L, no payment
will be made on an item or category of items in excess of the maximum payment in effect at the time the claim arose, except
as provided in section 536.174(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Commander, USARCS will promulgate additional guides, references, and tables to assist in computing allowable
compensation under this subpart. (See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, chap 2.)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Compensation may be allowed even though the property was not in the actual possession of the claimant at the time of
the damage or loss. Compensation may also be allowed even though the property was not owned by the claimant, provided
it was lawfully under his or her dominion and control. However, compensation will not be allowed for damage or loss
to personal property transported to accommodate another, other than the claimant's family members, nor will compensation
for damage or loss to a vehicle loaned to a claimant be allowed unless both the claimant and the owner are proper party
claimants. A vehicle registered in the name of the claimant or a spouse is not deemed, as between them, to be loaned.
When a vehicle is subject to a lien, the vehicle is not deemed to be loaned merely because the title is in the name of the
lien-holder.

Determination of compensation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) A claim may be allowed only for the amount and quantity of personal property considered reasonable or useful for
the claimant to have used or possessed under the attendant circumstances, incident to his or her service or employment.
In determining the reasonableness or utility of types and quantities of property included in a claim cognizable under
this subpart, an approval or settlement authority will give consideration to the claimant's living conditions,
family size, social obligations, and need to have more than average quantities, as well as the circumstances attending
acquisition or possession of the property and the manner of damage or loss.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The maximum amounts allowable for specific types and categories of personal property listed in The Allowance
List_Depreciation Guide constitute a determination of amount of quantity deemed reasonable or useful. A maximum
allowance per item indicates that the allowance for a single item of the type or category of property involved will
not exceed that amount. A maximum allowance per claim indicates that the total allowance for all items of the listed
type or category is limited to that amount. Where both a maximum amount per item and per claim are applicable, the total
allowance for all items will be limited to the maximum per claim, which will reflect the allowance of not more than the
maximum per item for any individual item. To avoid application of these maximum allowances, a soldier or civilian
employee may obtain additional protection on shipments by requesting full replacement protection or increased
value protection. The Chief, Personnel Claims and Recovery Division, USARCS may waive the maximum in a particular
case for good cause shown.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Compensation allowable for an item of personal property will not exceed the actual value of the item at the time
of its loss, damage, or destruction. Guidance on determining the base figure for actual value, using replacement
costs, estimates, or the Table of Adjusted Dollar Value, is provided in DA Pam 27&hyph;162, chapter 2. Because soldiers
are permitted to replace items missing or destroyed during PCS moves from the Overseas Post Exchange Catalog, even
when ordering from this catalog is not otherwise permitted, such items may be valued using this catalog.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) In adjusting a base figure to determine actual value, standard yearly rates of depreciation have been established
for the types and categories of items that have generally recognized periods of useful life; standard flat rates of
depreciation have been established for certain kinds of items that decrease in value primarily as the result of the
fact they are no longer new and unused, but which do not continue to depreciate on a yearly basis since they are not subject
to fixed periods of useful life. (See Allowance List_Depreciation Guide.) However, if personal inspection of damaged
property indicates that it was in better than average condition prior to damage, a lesser rate of depreciation should
be applied. Similarly, if the evidence indicates that an item was in poor condition at time of damage, a higher rate
of depreciation is appropriate. Variations from the established rates of depreciation will be fully explained.
The following rules are to be observed in computing the depreciation applicable to any item:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Normally no depreciation is to be charged against goods during periods of storage. However, this does not mean
that deductions cannot be taken for other reasons, such as a reduction in the market value of an item because of changes
in style or obsolescence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Do not depreciate an item which is less than six months old (including an item subject to flat rate depreciation)
except clothing and other rapidly depreciating articles which may be subject to considerable use in such a short period
of time. Calculate yearly depreciation from the date an item is originally acquired to either the date of pickup (for
shipment or storage claims), or to the date the property was lost or damaged (for other personnel claims). If the claimant
acquired a used item, then the claimant should use either the date the original owner acquired the item and the original
purchase price, or the claimant's purchase price and date he or she purchased the item. In accordance with the Allowance
List_Depreciation Guide, compute yearly depreciation in 12 month increments (e.g., 6&hyph;17 months equals one
year), excluding the month the property was acquired and the month that the property was picked up, lost or damaged.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) No item will be depreciated by more than 75 percent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) No depreciation is charged against genuine antiques, objects of art, and collector's items, except for repair
of portions thereof, such as upholstery, which requires periodic replacement or repair. For the purpose of this rule,
a ``souvenir'' is not considered a collector's item.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Compensation normally allowed for an item damaged beyond economic repair is the actual value at the time of destruction.
However, if an item has not been totally destroyed and any part remains useful and has a salvage value, and that part
is to be retained by the claimant, the allowance will be the value at time of destruction less the ascertained value
of the salvageable part. If the claimant does not wish to retain any salvageable part of a destroyed item, he or she may
be allowed the full value at the time of the destruction with no deduction for salvage value, provided the claimant
turns in the salvageable part to the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office prior to payment of the claim or holds
the item for turn-in to the carrier (see DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 2&hyph;44). If the item is turned in to the Defense
Reutilization and Marketing Office, a receipt for the property, DD Form 1348&hyph;1 (DOD Single Line Item Release/Receipt
Document), will be included in the file of the paid claim. If the staff or command JA determines that salvageable items
are valued at $25.00 or less, he or she may advise the claimant to dispose of them other than by turn-in and this decision
will be noted on the chronology sheet. In certain situations it may be necessary for the claims office to assist the
claimant to arrange for disposition of the property.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) If, after payment of a claim, an approving or settlement authority discovers that the payment was erroneous because
the claimant misrepresented the quality, quantity, age, condition, or replacement or repair cost of items, or other
facts necessary to the adjudication of the claim, the approval or settlement authority may recalculate the amount
allowed and arrange for recoupment of the erroneous amount paid. However, this procedure should be used sparingly,
with doubts resolved in favor of the claimant. The procedure is independent of any other action taken against the claimant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) In determining allowable amounts, cents will be rounded off to the nearest whole dollar on each line item. Drop
amounts under 50 cents and increase amounts from 50 to 99 cents to the next dollar. Thus, $1.49 becomes $1.00 and $2.50
becomes $3.00.

(a) Expenses incident to repair or replacement. In addition to actual value, the cost of obtaining estimates of repair
necessary to substantiate amounts claimed for damaged property may be considered, provided the action of the claimant
in contracting for the estimates appears reasonable under the circumstances or was specifically directed by the
approval or settlement authority. However, when the cost of an estimate can be applied toward the bill due upon completion
of repairs, the cost of the estimate will not be allowed, whether or not the claimant chooses to have the repair done.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Replacement of certain documents. The fee charged for replacing certain necessary documents such as marriage
licenses, driver's licenses, passports, or birth certificates may be allowed when these documents are lost or destroyed.

(c) Sales tax and drayage. Sales tax and drayage (including postage or handling charges to mail an item or replacement
part) can be allowed up to $50 per claim prior to the actual cost being incurred. However, payment in excess of $50 will
require the claimant to substantiate that the cost has been incurred.

Property recovered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Before approval. Do not pay claims for missing property if the missing property is located before the claim is approved.
Only the transit related damage will be cognizable. As an exception to this rule, compensation may be allowed for necessary
items that were missing for an unreasonable time after the expected arrival date and were replaced by claimant prior
to the items being located. Necessary items are those that are basic to the operation of a household. If compensation
is allowed under the above exception, the claimant will disclaim in writing further interest and ownership in such
items in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) After approval. If missing property is located after the claim is approved for payment, the claimant will normally
be advised of his or her option to_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Accept any or all of the items located and remit the amount already allowed for such items to the United States. In
certain circumstances, the claimant will not have an option: the Chief, Personnel Claims and Recovery Division,
USARCS or his designee can require the claimant to accept any or all of the items and remit the amount allowed; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Disclaim in writing further interest and ownership in the property and retain the amount approved for payment.
If, however, the approval or settlement authority determines that any of the recovered property is substantially
different in quality, price, or value from the property claimed, the approval or settlement authority may require
the claimant to return the amount allowed for such property and accept the property.

When two or more claims arising from the same incident are, by reason of differences in amounts within the jurisdiction
of different approval or settlement authorities, action will be withheld on these claims until the authority having
jurisdiction over the largest claim has determined that the claims arising out of the incident are cognizable, unless
the claims lesser in amount are clearly cognizable and meritorious.

Emergency partial payments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Frequently a claimant is in immediate need of funds to replace damaged or destroyed property. An emergency partial
payment up to $2,000 is authorized under the following circumstances:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A hardship situation exists that can be alleviated by providing immediate funds for the repair or replacement
of certain property lost or damaged; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A claim has been presented.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The approval or settlement authority determines that the claim is clearly payable under this subpart, in an amount
exceeding the amount of the proposed emergency payment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The approval or settlement authority can approve an emergency partial payment on any claim that meets the above
criteria. If the adjudicated amount exceeds the approval or settlement authority's delegated monetary amount,
pay up to the delegated amount (less the emergency payment), mark the outside of the file ``PRIORITY'' and transfer
it with all documentation (to include computer disk, paper screen and memorandum of opinion) to the next higher claims
authority for additional payment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Prior to making any emergency payment, the authority approving such payment normally will obtain an executed
partial acceptance agreement from the claimant or his or her representative. Only the Chief, Personnel Claims and
Recovery Division, USARCS or his designee can authorize emergency partial payments above $2,000. The authority
requesting an emergency partial payment above $2,000 can coordinate telephonically with USARCS.

Personnel claims memorandum.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) A personnel claims memorandum of opinion will be included in the file of each personnel claim disapproved; forwarded
for adjudication, disapproval, or reconsideration; or forwarded with a recommendation that there be a deviation
from the Allowance List or other established policy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A personnel claims memorandum of opinion will be signed by the Claims JA. It will be routed through any intervening
settlement authority, addressed to the settlement authority who will take final action (for example, a disapproval
would be addressed to the SJA of an area claims office, and a reconsideration would be addressed to the Commander, USARCS).
The memorandum will be sufficiently detailed to explain fully and support the action taken or recommended. (See DA
Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 2&hyph;55I for further instructions.) It will be arranged as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Claimant's name and address.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Date and place the incident occurred giving rise to the claim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Amount of claim, the date it was filed, and the date reconsideration was requested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Subparts the claims were considered under, and a brief description of the incident or of the issues raised by the
claimant on reconsideration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Facts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Reconsideration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A claim will be reconsidered under the conditions listed below. Reconsiderations normally require additional investigation
and review. This additional information will be documented in the file. An approval or settlement authority_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) May always reconsider his or her action if the original action was in error or is incorrect based on new facts. This
may be pursuant to either a claimant's oral request for reconsideration or as a result of any post-settlement review
conducted on the claims file. Note that while the original approving or settlement authority may consider a claimant's
``oral'' request for reconsideration, claims personnel should advise claimants that a higher settlement authority
will not act on an oral request until the claimant presents it in writing in accordance paragraph (b) of this section.
The basis for any change will be reflected in the file.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Must reconsider a claim upon the written request of the claimant or someone acting on his or her behalf. The claimant
must clearly state the factual or legal basis for relief. However, the reconsideration process must be considered
not as an adversarial process, but rather as an opportunity for the approval or settlement authority to continue a
dialogue with the claimant. Every effort should be made to develop the claimant's version of the facts. A claim will
be reconsidered even if a settlement agreement has been executed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The original approval or settlement authority will modify the original action if he or she determines that the
original action was incorrect or is incorrect based on new evidence. The basis for any change will clearly be reflected
in the file.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A successor or higher approval or settlement authority will only modify the original action on the basis of fraud,
substantial new evidence, mistake (misinterpretation ) of law or regulation, or an error in calculation. The basis
for any change will clearly be reflected in the file.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) An approval or settlement authority can take final action on a request for reconsideration if he or she informs
the claimant in writing that the claimant_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Is aware of the right to have the file reviewed by USARCS; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Will accept the additional payment as full relief on the claim; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Knows that if the offer is not satisfactory, the check will still be issued (and can be cashed without prejudicing
his or her right to reconsideration); and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The file will be forwarded to USARCS for final review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If the approval or settlement authority does not grant additional relief, or the claimant does not wish to accept
an additional payment as full relief, or the claimant does not respond by the suspense date, the JA/claims attorney
will issue any offered payment and will forward the claim through any intervening area claims office or command claims
service to USARCS for final action. As an exception, the Commander U.S. Army Claims Service, Europe (USACSEUR), can
take final action on any reconsideration request forwarded there by a subordinate office so long as it does not involve
approving a waiver of a maximum allowance. The Commander, USACSEUR, will include a complete copy of the final action
and will forward the file to the Commander, USARCS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The approval or settlement authority should consider 60 days from the settlement date a reasonable time to either
submit a written request for reconsideration or provide an intent to file a reconsideration request. The claimant
will receive written notification of this time limit. Any reconsideration where denial is recommended because it
was not timely filed will be forwarded according to paragraph (b)(4) of this section. The Chief, Personnel Claims
and Recovery Division may grant relief on untimely requests for reconsideration on the basis of substantial new evidence,
fraud, mistake of law, or mathematical miscalculation. In appropriate situations, he may deny relief if the filing
delay precluded acquiring additional facts.

(a) Reductions for inaction. (1) The JA will ensure that, when a demand on a carrier or other third party (other than
a private insurer (see paragraph (a)(2) of this section) is required (see recovery from third party) and the claimant's
failure, absent good cause, to provide notice or perform other required actions materially prejudices effective
recovery action with respect to all or part of the loss, the amount otherwise allowable under this subpart will be reduced
by the amount of the anticipated recovery so affected on an item-by-item basis.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) When a claimant fails to provide timely notice to perfect a claim against his or her private insurer, the amount
allowed, absent good cause, the claim will be denied. In determining whether a claimant has good cause for failing
to provide timely notice to a private insurer, the JA will, in addition to the considerations in paragraph (a)(3) of
this section, determine whether the claimant (or agent) had knowledge of the requirement and willfully neglected
to provide notice. See &sect;536.170(f) for cases where a claimant refuses to provide information concerning private
insurance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Good cause is determined as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) When a claimant fails to provide timely notice to a carrier, warehouse firm, or private insurer, settlement and
approval authorities may waive reduction action for good cause only when one of the following circumstances directly
contributed to the claimant's failure to give timely notice:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Officially recognized absence (for example TDY and off post training exercises) resulting in claimant's absence
from official duty station for a significant portion of the notice period;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Hospitalization of claimant for a significant portion of the notice period; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Substantiated misinformation concerning notice requirements given to the claimant by government personnel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Requests for good cause waivers under circumstances other than those in paragraph (a) of this section may be granted
only be the Commander, USARCS, or designee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Prior to taking reduction action, the JA will ensure the claimant is provided an opportunity to explain the circumstances
of his or her failure to take appropriate action, and that the claim file is documented to show the claimant was afforded
this opportunity and the result provided. The chronology sheet in the file will contain an explanation of the JA's
decision regarding reduction or the lack thereof.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Information and assistance to claimants. Claims personnel will_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Furnish the necessary claims forms (DD Form 1842 and DD Form 1844) to any individual who indicates, in person or
by letter, that he or she desires to be compensated for loss or damage to personal property incident to service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Furnish instructions and advice as to the evidence required to substantiate the claim, assist in the completion
of claim forms, and help with the procurement of evidence in support of the loss and the amount claimed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Assure that the description of the items and the damage shown on DD Form 1844 are sufficiently detailed to permit
verification of the purchase price and replacement price or repair cost of the item claimed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Inform a claimant of the time limits within which a claim must be filed in order to considered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Inform all claimants that they must file and settle with their private insurance companies before the JA/claims
attorney will approve a claim for payment under this subpart. Claimants who state they have no insurance will be asked
to certify that fact and the written statement will be included in the claim file. The claimant will be required to submit
proof of final action by the insurer. Claims personnel will examine each claim after an insurance settlement and determine
if prior settlement by the insurer (including excess valuation coverage) is more advantageous to the claimant. A
claims JA/attorney may decide to approve a claim for payment under this subpart without a claimant first settling
with his or her insurance in exceptional cases where an insurance company improperly refuses to pay a claim or the JA
determines the claimant has good cause (see &sect;536.181(a) (2) and (3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Advise a claimant to notify the JA of any offer of settlement or denial of liability by any third party, and to secure
the JA's written consent before executing a release or acceptance of any such offer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Take an active and continuing role in publicizing claims information to soldiers and their families.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Other actions. The JA will ensure that_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) DD Form 1840R is dispatched to the appropriate third party within 75 days of delivery of goods, that a copy of the
DD Form 1840 and 1840R is dispatched to the destination transportation office, in appropriate cases, and that a signed
and dated copy is maintained and incorporated into any claim filed. (See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 2&hyph;55.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The servicing transportation office is directed to inspect damaged property in appropriate cases. (See DA Pam
27&hyph;162, paragraph 2&hyph;41).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The DD Form 1844 is completed (amount allowed column, remarks column, and where appropriate, either or both columns
for exceptions) prior to settling the claim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) All documents written in a foreign language are translated into English, either verbatim or in summarized form.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Unearned freight charges are deducted for property which carriers lose or irreparably damage. (See DA Pam 27&hyph;162,
paragraph 3&hyph;27.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) A claims office representative will periodically attend local transportation office outbound briefings to
ensure that appropriate information is being disseminated to soldiers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Inspection by claims office personnel are conducted in appropriate cases (large claim, reconsideration, fraudulent
claim) and incorporated into the file. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Financial. The JA will properly manage claims funds. This includes_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) On a monthly basis, reconcile recovery accounts with the servicing finance and accounting office (FAO) to insure
moneys are being properly deposited into the correct account;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) On a monthly basis, reconcile expenditure accounts with the servicing FAO to ensure that FAO expenditures match
claims office expenditures; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Ensuring expenditures are from current fiscal year accounts.

(a) The Army Carrier Recovery Program involves the supervising and pursuing of administrative settlements of all
claims in favor of the Government against third parties arising from claims settled under the preceding sections
of this subpart. The Program includes making and issuing policies, procedures, and instructions pertaining to recovery
action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Field claims approval and settlement authorities are responsible for local implementation of the Army Carrier
Recovery Program and will ensure that_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Proper notice is provided to third parties (see DA Pam 27162, paragraph 2&hyph;55). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Claims are processed so that relevant time limitations on pursuing recovery demands are met, particularly the
6-year statute of limitations set forth in 28 U.S.C. 2415(a). In overseas areas, statute of limitations relevant
to locally procured tenders and contracts will be observed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Servicing transportation offices provide supporting documentation and perform necessary inspections in a
timely manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Claims files include complete, legible documentation needed to support recovery action, including a copy of
the itemized breakdown prepared by the claimant's insurer when appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Third party liability is correctly calculated in accordance with DA Pam 27&hyph;162, chapter 3, and is reflected
on all copies of the DD Form, 1844. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Written demands for reimbursement are prepared against appropriate third parties, and demands are dispatched
locally or forwarded for centralized recovery within 30 days of settlement (see &sect;536.196). If this 30-day standard
is not met or no demand is prepared because liability will not be pursued, claims personnel will explain the basis for
this on the claims chronology sheet. Note, however, that files will not be forwarded for centralized recovery prior
to the 21st day after settlement in order to afford the claimant an opportunity to request reconsideration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Unearned freight letters are prepared when required by DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 3&hyph;27, and are either
included in files forwarded for centralized recovery or are dispatched locally after settlement with the carrier.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Settlement offers from third parties are accepted or rejected within 30 days of receipt.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The third party is not always held responsible even though a prima facie case is established. The burden of proof will
be on the third party to show that loss or damage was caused by one of the excepted conditions that relieves it of liability.
The following exceptions emphasize or add to conditions stated in the various third party rate tenders:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Inherent vice of the article. To be used as an exclusion of liability, the third party must establish not just the
general tendency of an item to be damaged in transit, but that the damage was due solely to that propensity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Infestations by mollusks, arachnids, crustaceans, parasites, or other types of pests, fumigation, or decontamination
when not the fault of the third party.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Preexisting damage indicated on the inventory.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Mechanical failure of an appliance unless there is evidence of external damage or unless it can be clearly shown
that the mechanical failure was caused by the third party.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Loss or damage that occurs while the shipment was in the custody and/or control of the Government.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Any item for which timely notice has not been provided to the third party.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Any loss or damage not presented to the third party within the 6 year statute of limitations for filing claims.

Limits of liability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Carriers. (1) Liability of Through Government Bill of Lading (TGBL) or International Through Government Bill
of Lading (ITGBL) carriers for household goods shipments is as stated on the GBL. The TGBL carrier may be liable for
the full depreciated value of the claim or the current replacement cost of items, without application of depreciation,
if the owner purchased replacement cost protection (RCP), also known as ``full replacement protection''. (See DA
Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 2&hyph;51.) For the purpose of computing weight, each piece or package shipped constitutes
one article. Any article taken apart or ``knocked down'' for handling constitutes one article. Individual article
weights are listed in the Joint Military-Industry Table of Weights in DA Pam 27&hyph;162, Table G&hyph;1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Liability of ITGBL carriers for hold baggage shipments (Codes 7, 8, and J) is normally 60 cents per pound times the
gross weight per container (or current contract liability). Excess valuation or RCP is not available on such shipments.
(See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 3&hyph;11.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Liability of domestic freight carriers of household goods shipments is generally stated to be 10 cents per pound
per article on the GBL. Excess valuation or RCP is not available on such shipments. For the purpose of computing weight
under this type of shipment, each packed item (such as a dish) constitutes one item or article. (Also see DA Pam 27&hyph;162,
paragraph 3&hyph;15.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Liability of commercial airlines is stated on the GBL. Excess valuation or RCP is not available on such shipments.
(See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 3&hyph;17.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Nontemporary storage (NTS) contractors. The contract for storage of household goods is the Basic Ordering Agreement,
which is governed by DOD 4500.34&hyph;R, chapter 2&hyph;1. Under this agreement (DOD 4500.34&hyph;R, appendix
H), an NTS contractor is liable for a maximum of $50.00 per inventory line item. (As an exception to this rule, regardless
of the way a schrank is listed on the inventory, only one charge of $50.00 can be applied when liability is calculated.)
The contractor may be liable to the full extent of the declared value if the owner purchased an insurance policy from
the warehouse firm. No liability can be pursued against the NTS contractor when goods are given out to a carrier unless
an exception sheet was prepared by the carrier showing any differences as to shortages or overages or the condition
of items. The exception sheet must be signed and dated by a representative of the warehouse to be valid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Packing and containerization contractors. A local contractor is liable for loss or damage in the amount of 60 cents
per pound (or current contract liability) times the weight per article as stated in the liability clause of the contract.
Each shipping piece or package constitutes one article. Excess valuation or RCP is not available on such shipments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Mobile home carriers. Liability is governed by the applicable rate tariff, rate tender, declared valuation,
or personal property government bill of lading (PPGBL) as stated in DOD 4500.34&hyph;R, appendix E, and generally
is the full cost of repairs for damage incurred during transit. In addition to the exclusions listed in paragraph 11&hyph;26,
a mobile home carrier is excused from liability when the carrier has introduced substantial proof that a latent structural
defect (one not detectable during the carrier's preliminary inspection) caused the loss or damage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Liability limit. Except for claims involving mobile home carriers, excess valuation or RCP, the liability of
any third party is limited to the lease amount of the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Weight liability or NTS inventory line item maximum.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Amount paid by DA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Depreciated value of an item (if the third party bases an offer of settlement on the Joint Military/Industry Depreciation
Guide in DA Pam 27&hyph;162, appendix G, Table G&hyph;2.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Settlement procedures in recovery actions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Offers of settlement. An offer of settlement or tender of payment from a third party should be carefully examined
giving due regard to all factors involved. When such consideration shows the offer or tender to be appropriate, it
may be accepted. When the offer or tender does not appear appropriate, further correspondence should be initiated
with the third party to clarify the issues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Prior acceptance of settlement by owner. DA is not bound by the owner's acceptance of a settlement from a third party
where the acceptance was procured through fraud, duress, collusion, mistake of fact, or misrepresentation. In such
circumstances, when a claim is filed, all correspondence with the third party must be included in the file and further
recovery action should be taken where the prior settlement is inadequate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Establishment of timely notice. (1) Handled by one third party only. Where one third party had responsibility
for the shipment from pickup to delivery, written exceptions on DD Form 1840 (Notice of Loss or Damage) is evidence
that items in the shipment were lost or damaged when delivered. However, a clear delivery receipt (DD Form 1840) is
only prima facie evidence of good delivery and may be rebutted by submission of DD Form 1840R, listing all later discovered
loss or damage. The DD Form 1840R must be dispatched with 75 days of delivery; the date of dispatch is the controlling
date. However, the normal 75-day limit for reporting additional damage on DD Form 1840R may be extended by the claimant's
hospitalization or officially recognized absence under the Joint Military-Industry Agreement on Loss and Damage
Rules (DA Pam 27&hyph;162, appendix E, sec. II). Implementation dates for the use of this form and details regarding
its use are found in DNA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 3&hyph;4. On claims for household goods delivered prior to these
implementation dates, timely notice is established by exceptions noted at delivery on D Form 619&hyph;1 (Statement
of Accessorial Services Performed), or on the inventory if dated and signed by a representative of the third party.
Timely notice also includes DD Form 1840, or a letter or other document noting loss or damage dispatched to the third
party within 45 days of delivery.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Handled by two or more third parties. Each time custody of the property changes hands, the inventory will be annotated
to show any overage, shortage, and damage found. In the case of pickup by a carrier from a NTS contractor, an exception
sheet must be prepared and be acknowledged by the warehouse firm to reflect any changes in the condition of the goods.

Payment to the claimant beyond the statutory limit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When payment of the statutory limit is made on a claim determined to be meritorious in a greater amount after the application
of individual and category maximum allowances, USARCS will apply amounts recovered from a carrier or contractor
to compensate the claimant to the extent of the difference between the statutory limit and the amount that would have
been paid but for the statutory limit. However, when an insurer has paid any portion of the value of the items involved,
USARCS will apply the procedure in &sect;536.190(b). Any additional recovery monies available will be paid out under
536.190(b), if applicable.

Reimbursements to claimants and insurers from money received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
USARCS is responsible for pursuing recovery on all claims paid under this subpart that involve payment of the statutory
limit, increased released valuation purchased by the member, replacement cost protection, and/or private insurance.
When forwarding these files to USARCS, the field office should identify them by writing in red on the front upper left
corner of the file, ``IRV,'' ``RCP,'' or ``STATUTORY LIMIT.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Reimbursement to a claimant. Only USARCS may reimburse claimants on files which are required to be forwarded to
USARCS for centralized recovery. In cases where a JA/claims attorney allowed payment of a claim before settling with
private insurance, a command claims service, area claims office, or claims processing office with approval authority
may always make a supplemental payment to a claimant when the claimant's private insurer paid more on an item than did
the Government. If a claimant has not been fully compensated, he or she can receive a supplemental payment up to the
adjudicated value of the claimant's loss under the following circumstances:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) When the adjudicated value of the loss on an item exceeds an item or category maximum and the amount collected exceeds
the amount paid on the claim, the claimant will be paid the adjudicated value to the extent that the amount recovered
exceeds the amount paid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When the adjudicated value of the loss on an item exceeds an item or category maximum and the claimant has purchased
increased valuation protection or other depreciated value coverage, the claimant will be paid up to the amount of
the additional coverage to the extent that this does not exceed the adjudicated value on that item or category.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) When the value of the loss on an item exceeds DA's payment and the claimant has purchased RCP, the claimant will be
paid up to the amount of the additional coverage to the extent that this does not exceed the value determined for that
item.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Reimbursement to insurers by USARCS only. When a claimant has purchased an insurance policy covering the shipmentor
storage of property and the insurance company pays any portion of the value of items lost or damaged, the insurance
company is entitled, to the extent of its payment, to reimbursement of a pro rata share of the amount recovered on such
items.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Reimbursement of recovery money to a carrier, warehouse or contractor. If a claims office or contracting office
determines that recovery or offset against a carrier, contractor or warehouse was improper, the claims office will
forward a request (with appropriate justification) to the Chief, Personnel Claims and Recovery Division, USARCS,
who will authorize a refund as necessary.

Recovery action against a claimant.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A claimant is entitled to the benefit of any additional coverage purchased (such as private insurance, excess valuation,
or RCP) on an item-by-item basis as described in DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 2&hyph;50. If a claimant is compensated
by a third party on an item and is also compensated by DA pursuant to this subpart, the claimant is entitled to retain
only the portion of the payment that represents the total adjudicated value of the item, without regard to a limitation
on payment due to application of a maximum allowance. If a claimant is compensated twice and the total exceeds the amount
the claimant is entitled to retain, prompt action to recover the excess will be taken in accordance with DA Pam 27&hyph;162,
paragraph 2&hyph;55m.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The ``Liability and Insurance'' clause used in stevedoring and related services contracts provides in pertinent
part that the contractor is liable to the Government for loss or damage to personal property (including POV's), caused
in whole or in part, by his or her negligence or fault and that the amount determined by the contracting officer will
be withheld from payments otherwise due the contractor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Claims offices processing claims against the Government under this paragraph for loss, damage, or destruction
of personal property of any kind (including POV's) caused in whole or in part by the negligence of a contractor will,
when final recovery action is complete, forward the claim file directly to the Commander, USARCS. Claims offices
processing a claim involving a POV will obtain an affirmative statement from the claimant as to whether settlement
is also being processed directly with the contractor or has already been received from the contractor. Normally,
a settlement with the contractor bars further claim against the Government. (But see &sect;536.186(b).) The procedures
for processing POV recovery actions against stevedores are in &sect;536.195.

(2) Payment from $100&hyph;$1,999. For POV claims paid for any amount between $100 and $1,999, and if there is evidence
of ocean carrier liability, the entire claim file will be forwarded to Military Sealift Command, Atlantic, by transmittal
letter prepared in the format shown in DA Pam 27&hyph;162, figure 3&hyph;18. However, if there is evidence of liability
attributable to the inland shipment of POVs in Europe, the entire claim file will instead be forwarded to the U.S. Army

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Payment $2,000 or more. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Non-European claims offices. If the amount paid on a POV shipment claim is $2,000 or more, or if it appears that the
POV was dropped or was mishandled severely in shipment, claims personnel will prioritize recovery action and handle
the larger claims first. Claims personnel will_

(A) Assert a demand against the responsible contractor if an outport contractor, stevedore, or inland transporter
damaged the vehicle; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Forward the claim to USACSEUR for recovery if the damage occurred while the POV was in the custody of a European outport,
stevedore, or inland shipment contractor; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Close the file and forward it for retirement if the POV was damaged while in the custody of government personnel;
or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Forward the claim to the Military Sealift Command if the damage occurred while the vehicle was in the custody of
the ocean carrier (ship) or if claims personnel cannot determine where the damage occurred.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) European claims offices. If the amount paid on a POV shipment claim is $2,000 or more, claims personnel will prioritize
assembly of the file and will forward it to USACSEUR for recovery action 21 days after the claim is paid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Personal property other than vehicles (for example, household goods). After payment of a claim involving personal

(a) Offset actions against GBL carriers. Only USARCS may process offset actions against GBL carriers. (See DA Pam
27&hyph;162, paragraph 3&hyph;26.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Offset actions against NTS contractors. When an NTS contractor is liable and a satisfactory settlement cannot
be reached, the claims office will forward the file to the Regional Storage Management Office (RSMO) responsible
for administering the Basic Ordering Agreements for storage in that geographic area. (See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph
3&hyph;26.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Offset against packing and containerization contractors. When any claims office determines that a packing and
crating contractor is liable and a satisfactory settlement cannot be made, a copy of the complete claim file will be
forwarded by letter to the local contracting office administering the contract, requesting offset action. The contracting
officer will conduct a careful review of the claim file and will make a determination on the issue of contractual liability
on the information contained in the file and on personal findings of fact in accordance with the contract involved.
(Also see DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 3&hyph;26.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Title 4 CFR 102.3(b)(2) affords a carrier or contractor certain procedural rights prior to offset. A JA/claims
attorney will certify to the contracting office that the Army has complied with 4 CFR 102.3 if requested to do so. The
JA/claims attorney will give the carrier/contractor: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Written notice of the nature and amount of the debt, and the agency's intention to collect by offset if the debt isn't
paid. The DD Form 1843 or demand letter provides this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The opportunity to inspect and copy agency records pertaining to the debt if requested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The opportunity to obtain review within the agency if the carrier/contractor requests this. If requested, the
JA/claims attorney will review the file prior to offset. No oral hearing is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The opportunity to enter into a written agreement with the agency to repay the debt. A carrier/contractor will
normally be allowed 45 days to follow up a settlement offer with a check. If a satisfactory check is not received within
the 45 days, the JA/claims attorney should offset the carrier/contractor without delay. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) In accordance with 4 CFR 102.3(b)(5), the head of an area claims office or claims processing office may effect offset
prior to completion of any or all of the procedures in paragraph (d) above if failure to promptly offset would substantially
prejudice the Government's ability to collect the debt.

General.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This subpart sets forth the procedures to be followed in the settlement and payment of claims by employees of nonappropriated
fund activities for the loss of or damage to personal property incident to their employment, and for claims generated
by the acts or omissions of the employees of such funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Claims by employees for the loss of or damage to personal property incident to employment will be processed in the manner
prescribed by subpart K and will be paid from nonappropriated funds in accordance with &sect;536.207.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->
Claims generated by the acts or omissions of employees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Processing. Claims arising out of acts or omissions of employees of nonappropriated funds activities will be
processed and settled in the manner specified for similar claims against the United States except that payment will
be made from nonappropriated funds in accordance with AR 215&hyph;1, and &sect;536.207. Relevant procedural requirements
of pertinent subparts of this part, as stated below, will be followed except as provided in &sect;&sect;536.206 and
536.207. However, when the NAFI is protected by a commercial insurer, for example, flying and parachute clubs, the
claim will be referred to the insurer as outlined in paragraph (e) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Claims arising within the United States, its territories, commonwealths, or possessions. Such claims will be
processed in the manner prescribed by subparts C, D or E as appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Claims arising outside the United States, its territories, commonwealths, or possessions. Such claims will
be processed in accordance with the provisions of applicable SOFA or in the manner prescribed by subparts C, D or E as
appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Reporting and investigation. Such claims will be investigated in accordance with subpart B of this part and AR
215&hyph;1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Reporting. All incidents involving personal injury, death, or property damage resulting from falls, falling
objects, or accidents of like nature, occurring in post exchanges, bowling lanes, officers and noncommissioned
officers open messes, or other facilities located on land or situated in a building used by an activity of the DA that
employs personnel compensated from nonappropriated funds, should be reported immediately to the officer in charge
of the nonappropriated fund activity concerned. The report should be made by the employee who initially received
notice of the incident, regardless of the fact that the individual involved denies sustaining personal injury or
property damage. Upon receipt of the report of the incident, the officer in charge of the nonappropriated fund activity
concerned will transmit the report to the installation or other appropriate claims officer for investigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Investigation. (i) As soon as practicable in the investigation of a claim generated by a nonappropriated fund
activity, a determination will be made as to whether the claim is cognizable under this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Claim files that relate to claims determined to be cognizable under this section will be marked with the symbol
``NAF'' immediately following the claimant's name to preclude erroneous payment from appropriated funds. This
symbol will also be included in the subject line of all correspondence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Claims exceeding $15,000. When a claims approval or settlement authority receives a claim against a nonappropriated
fund activity, other than the Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES), that exceeds $15,000, he or she will forward
a copy to both USARCS and the Army Central Insurance Fund, HQDA, ATTN: CFSC&hyph;RM&hyph;I, Room 1240, 2461 Eisenhower
Avenue, Alexandria, VA 22331&hyph;0508. A copy of all tort claims against AAFES will be forwarded to Headquarters,
AAFES, ATTN: General Counsel, P.O. Box 660202, Dallas, TX 75266&hyph;0202.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Customer complaints. Customer complaints other than at AAFES activities will be settled under the provisions
of AR 215&hyph;1 rather than under the provisions of this section. AAFES generated complaints will be handled in accordance
with Exchange Service Manual 57&hyph;2.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Commercial insurance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Normally a claims investigation under subpart B will not be conducted but the claims officer will refer the claim
to the insurer and furnish copies as indicated in paragraph (c) of this section. Assistance will be furnished to the
insurer as needed. Copies of any other required investigations may be furnished to the insurer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The status of the claim will be ascertained at key intervals to ensure that progress is being made, negotiations
are proper, and to close the file. The Commander, USARCS will be advised of any problems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) If requested by either insurer or NAFI officials, the appropriate claims authority will assist in or conduct negotiations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Where NAFI vehicles are required to be covered by insurance in foreign countries, the insurer will process the
claim. However, if the insurer refuses to settle the claim in timely manner or is insolvent, the claim may be processed
under subpart J procedures where applicable.

The RIMP is administered by the U.S. Army Community and Family Support Center under the provisions of AR 215&hyph;1.
Non-NAFI RIMP claims are not cognizable under any other provision of this regulation. However, except as otherwise
provided in this section, Non-NAFI RIMP claims are subject to the same requirements that apply to other tort claims.
USARCS carefully monitors all such claims to ensure proper investigation and resolution.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Non-NAFI RIMP claims can arise from the activities of_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Members of recreational NAFIs or authorized users of NAF recreational property, while using such property, except
real property, in the manner and for the purposes authorized by DA regulations and the charter, constitution, and
bylaws of the particular NAF activity. This category of persons generally has been limited to members and users of
recreational facilities such as flying clubs organized as NAFIs and craft shops. This category does not include customers
of exchanges, snack bars, motion picture theaters, or similar facilities. Whether a claim based on an act or omission
of a member or authorized user of other types of NAF activities, such as officers' messes, would be cognizable under
this paragraph depends on the facts and circumstances involved, including the degree of participation by the member
or authorized user in the activities of the fund. Claims arising from the use of NAF property, as defined in this paragraph,
are not cognizable under the FTCA or MCA, since the use of such recreational property is by individuals not considered
to be employees of the Army or NAFI acting within the scope of their office or employment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Family child care (FCC) providers, authorized members of the provider's household, and approved substitute
providers while care under the FCC program is being provided in the manner prescribed in AR 608&hyph;10, except as
excluded below. Such claims are generally limited to injuries to or death of children receiving care under the FCC
program which are caused by the negligence of such individuals. Claims arising from the transportation of such children
in motor vehicles and claims involving loss or damage of property are not cognizable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Although Non-NAFI RIMP claims do not involve employees of the United States, a claim under this section that is
listed in &sect;536.51 of this part is not payable. For example, a soldier injured on a post golf course when hit by a
golf cart operated by an authorized user is barred by the incident-to-service exclusion from recovering under this
section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) A claims approval or settlement authority will ask the Commander, USARCS for an advisory opinion prior to settling
any Non-NAFI RIMP claim where the person whose conduct generated liability does not clearly fall within the above
listed categories. Such authorities may also ask, through the Commander, USARCS, for an advisory opinion from the
U.S. Army Community and Family Support Center prior to settling any claim arising under paragraph (a)(2) of this section,
where it is not clear that the injured or deceased child was receiving care within the scope of the FCC program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The total payments for all claims (including derivative claims) arising as a result of injury to or death of any
one person are limited to $500,000 for each incident. Continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same or
similar general harmful activity or conditions is treated as one incident for purposes of determining the limit of
liability.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Reporting. All Non-NAFI RIMP claims (regardless of the amount claimed) and incidents that could give rise to Non-NAFI
RIMP claims will be reported to USARCS and the ACIF immediately.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Investigation. Field claims offices are responsible for the investigation of Non-NAFI RIMP claims. Such investigations
will be closely coordinated with program managers responsible for the activity generating the claim. Close coordination
with USARCS is required, and USARCS will maintain mirror files of the investigation of all actual and potential claims.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Payment. Non-NAFI RIMP claims will be transmitted to The Army Central Insurance Fund, ATTN: CFSC&hyph;RMB&hyph;I,
Room 1240, 2461 Eisenhower Avenue, Alexandria, VA 22331&hyph;0508 for payment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Commercial insurance. The provisions of &sect;536.203(e) (1) through (3) are also applicable to claims arising
under this section, except that in claims involving FCC providers, a claims investigation will be conducted regardless
of the presence of commercial insurance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Federal statutory authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The Federal Claims Collection Act (31 U.S.C. 3711), as amended by the Debt Collection Act of 1982 and Pub. L. 101&hyph;552
(15 November 1990). The Federal Claims Collection Act states that Federal agencies will try to collect all claims
of the United States for money or property. Among other things, it provides a basis for agencies to recover for damage
to Government property.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Federal Medical Care Recovery Act (42 U.S.C. 2651&hyph;53) (hereinafter ``FMCRA''). The FMCRA provides for
the recovery of the reasonable value of medical care furnished by the United States on account of injury or disease
incurred under circumstances creating tort liability upon some third person. The FMCRA is implemented by EO 11060
and 28 CFR 43; the Federal Claims Collection Standards (DA Pam 27&hyph;162, appendix M) also apply, as appropriate.
However, some procedures appropriate for liquidated debts may not be appropriate for unliquidated claims.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 10 U.S.C. 1095. 10 U.S.C. 1095 provides authority for military health care facilities to collect the reasonable
cost of health care from health insurance and medicare supplemental policies. As amended by Pub. L. 101&hyph;510
(5 November 1990), this statute provides claims offices with additional authority to assert claims against automobile
insurers for care provided in an MTF on or after that date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Other authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) State Workers' Compensation laws.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) State hospital lien laws.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Contract rights under terms of insurance policies include medical payment coverage, uninsured and underinsured
coverages, and no-fault.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) State automobile no-fault laws.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) General. A JA or claims attorney (designated per &sect;536.6) assigned responsibility for asserting affirmative
claims may be designated as a recovery judge advocate (RJA) or recovery attorney, as appropriate. This designation
may be in addition to or in lieu of designation as a claims JA or claims attorney, depending on the local command needs
and available personnel. When assertion of affirmative claims is a full-time responsibility of an attorney or JA,
the table of distribution and allowances (TDA) position title can also reflect the recovery function.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Designation. (1) The chief of a command claims service, an area claims office, or a claims processing office with
approval authority may designate an RJA or recovery attorney for all or part of the area of responsibility assigned
to the service or office. All designations will be in writing. A command claims service may withhold designation authority
within its area of operations or place reasonable restrictions on such designation by subordinate offices through
appropriate command directives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Commander, USARCS will designate RJAs and recovery attorneys for areas not within the responsibility of a
command claims service or area claims office.

Purpose and policy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) This subpart prescribes procedures for the administrative determination, assertion, collection, settlement,
and waiver of claims in favor of the United States for damage to, loss, or destruction of Army property, and for the recovery
of the reasonable value of medical care furnished or to be furnished by the United States, under the statutes cited
in &sect;536.213. Sound governmental policy in the collection of claims of the United States for money or property
requires aggressive agency collection action. Responsible officials within DA will ensure that personnel asserting
claims are properly trained and supported to take timely and effective action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The subpart does not apply to the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Claims between Federal agencies. If such a claim cannot be resolved by negotiation, it should be referred to GAO.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Maritime claims under subpart H.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Affirmative actions for nonmonetary relief (for example, evictions, specific performance, and injunctive
relief).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Claims arising out of tax aspects of a contract, or other transaction or activity involving either nonappropriated
or appropriated funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The senior Judge Advocate of a command having a command claims service, or the commander, USACSEUR, will prescribe
procedures for implementing single service claims responsibility under DODD 5155.8 and for implementing any provision
in a treaty or international agreement that limits or provides special methods for asserting claims in favor of the
U.S. With the concurrence of the Commander, USARCS, the senior JA of a command having a command claims service, or the
commander, USACSEUR, is authorized to modify the procedures in this subpart to accommodate special circumstances.
The SJA will provide the Chief, Personnel Claims and Recovery Division, with a copy of all published guidance.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Claims offices may accept the full amount asserted on an affirmative claim. In addition_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) TJAG; TAJAG; the Commander, USARCS; and the Chief, Personnel Claims and Recovery Division, USARCS, may compromise
or terminate collection action on a property damage claim asserted for $100,000 or less; and may compromise, waive
or terminate collection action on a medical care claim asserted for $100,000 or less.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The senior JA of a command having a command claims service, or the commander, USACSEUR, may compromise, waive or
terminate collection action on a medical care or property damage claim asserted for $100,000 or less.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Unless authority is withheld by the Commander, USARCS or the chief of a command claims service, the head of an area
claims office may:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Compromise up to $25,000 of the amount asserted on a property damage or medical care claim asserted for $40,000
or less (see &sect;536.229(b)).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Terminate collection action on a property damage or medical care claim asserted for $25,000 or less when further
collection efforts are not feasible (see paragraph 14&hyph;19c); or waive a medical care claim asserted for $25,000
or less when collection in any amount will result in undue hardship to the injured party (see &sect;536.229(d)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The head of an area claims office may delegate authority to a claims processing office to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Compromise up to $20,000 of the amount asserted on a property damage or medical care claim asserted for $40,000
or less (see &sect;536.229(d)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Terminate collection action on a property damage or medical care claim asserted for $20,000 or less when further
collection efforts are not feasible (see paragraph 14&hyph;19c); or waive a medical care claim asserted for $20,000
or less when collection in any amount will result in undue hardship to the injured party (see &sect;536.229(d)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The head of an area claims office or a claims processing office, or the chief of a command claims service, may redelegate
up to $20,000 of his or her authority to an RJA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) In determining whether a settlement authority has authority to compromise, terminate, or waive a claim, consider
the medical costs for all parties injured in a single incident as a single assertion; and consider the total value of
Government property damaged or destroyed in a single incident as a single assertion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Only the Department of Justice (DOJ) may approve claims involving:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Compromise, termination, or waiver of a medical care or property damage claim asserted for more than $100,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Settlement actions previously referred to DOJ.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Settlement where a third party has filed suit against the United States or the injured party for the same incident
which gave rise to the claim of the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) The commander, USARCS, or the Chief, Personnel Claims and Recovery Division, in consultation with the Department
of Justice, will approve all claims involving unusual circumstances, a new point of law which may serve as a precedent,
or a question of policy.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;536.217
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->
Basic considerations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The Federal Claims Collection Standards. The Federal Claims Collection Standards, (4 CFR chapter II, parts 103
and 104, reprinted in DA Pam 27&hyph;162, appendix M), prescribe standards for compromising and litigating property
damage claims, and provide general guidance for compromising and litigating medical care claims.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Time limitations. (1) Property damage claims. Claims asserted under the Federal Claims Collection Act for damage
to Government property are founded in tort and must be brought within three years after the action ``first accrues''
(28 U.S.C. 2415b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Medical care claims asserted under the FMCRA or 10 U.S.C. 1095. Claims asserted under the FMCRA or against an automobile
liability insurer under 10 U.S.C. 1095 are also founded in tort and must be brought within three years after the action
``first accrues'' (28 U.S.C. 2415b). Although no court has ruled on this issue, claims asserted under 10 U.S.C. 1095
against a no-fault or PIP insurer are presumably founded in a contract ``implied in law''; if so, they must be brought
within six years (28 U.S.C. 2415a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Computing the statute of limitations. Normally, a medical care claim ``first accrues'' on the initial date of
treatment, and a property damage claim accrues on the date that the property was damaged. However, in computing the
statute of limitations, 28 U.S.C. 2416(c) excludes the period of time before a U.S. official charged with the responsibility
to act in the circumstances knows or should know that there is a basis for a claim. See United States v. Hunter, 645 F.
Supp 758, 760 (N.D.N.Y. 1986). For example, the three year statute of limitations would not begin to run on most medical
care claims paid by CHAMPUS at least until the date on which CHAMPUS received the bill from the provider.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Medical care claims asserted under state law. Claims asserted against an insurer on a third party beneficiary
theory or against a state workers' compensation fund must be brought within the applicable state statute of limitations
which can range from one to six years. Normally, the statute of limitations would begin to run when the injury occurred,
rather than the date of initial treatment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Applicable law. Federal law does not define what constitutes a tort. Unless the RJA can properly apply the law of
another jurisdiction under conflict of law rules, the RJA will apply the law of the state or country where an incident
occurred in determining whether the Government has a cause of action founded in tort.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Concurrent claims. (1) Claims for damage to Army property and claims for medical care arising from the same incident
will be processed under the section applicable to each. However, efforts should be made to include all medical care
and property damage claims in a single demand against a third party or insurance company. Settlement agreements will
be drafted so that settlement and release of one claim shall not prejudice settlement of the remaining claim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the incident giving rise to a claim in favor of the United States also gives rise to a potential claim against the
United States, the claim in favor of the Government will be asserted and processed only by a claims approval or settlement
authority who has jurisdiction to take final action on the claim against the Government.

Claims against certain prospective defendants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) U.S. Government agencies. RJAs will not assert a claim against any department, agency or instrumentality of the
United States. A self-insured NAFI, whether revenue producing, welfare or sundry, is considered an ``agency or instrumentality
of the United States''; a private association is not.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Property damage assertions against soldiers and employees. The report of survey system (chapter 13, AR 735&hyph;5)
is the primary mechanism for collecting from a civilian employee or a soldier (including an AR or NG soldier) for damage
to government property. Report of survey procedures should normally be used whenever applicable. AR 735&hyph;5
requires claims offices to assert property damage claims against soldiers and employees in two instances:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Damage caused by POV's. Pursuant to paragraph 14&hyph;30, AR 735&hyph;5, if a report of survey approving authority
assesses liability against a soldier or civilian employee for negligently damaging Government property using a
POV, and the soldier or employee does not make restitution, the approving authority will forward the approved report
of survey to the claims office. The RJA will assert a demand against the soldier or employee's liability insurance
for the full value of the damage. If the soldier or employee does not have insurance, the RJA will return the action for
the approving authority to withhold a month's pay from the soldier or employee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Exhaustion of collection remedies. Pursuant to paragraph 14&hyph;4b(7), AR 735&hyph;5, if an F&amp;AO has exhausted
all administrative mechanisms, including IRS offset, for collecting amounts assessed under a report of survey from
a soldier, ROTC cadet or employee, the F&amp;AO may refer the action to the servicing claims office for recovery action
under the Federal Claims Collection Act. The RJA will assert such claims and initiate litigation if appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Medical care assertions against soldiers, employees, family members, and retirees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Acting within scope of employment. The RJA will not assert a medical care claim against a tortfeasor who is a civilian
employee or service member (including a reserve component member) acting within scope of employment, whether or
not the employee or member has private insurance (cf. U.S. v. Gilman, 347 U.S. 507 (1954)). ``Scope of employment''
is determined by the laws of the state where the injury occurred.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Persons not in scope who injure themselves. An RJA will not assert a claim based on a tort liability theory against
a tortfeasor who is a soldier, family member or retiree for the tortfeasor's own medical care; a person cannot create
tort liability by injuring himself or herself. In such instances, however, the RJA may assert a claim under 10 U.S.C.
1095 against the injured tortfeasor's personal injury protection (PIP) or medical payments insurance coverage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Persons not in scope with liability insurance. An RJA may assert a medical care claim against the liability insurer
of a service member, civilian employee, family member or retiree who injures some other person entitled to medical
care. Interfamilial tort immunity would not preclude the RJA from asserting a medical care claim based on a tort liability
theory for care furnished to a tortfeasor's family members (see, e.g., U.S. v. Haynes, 445 F.2d 907 (5th Cir. 1971);
U.S. v. Moore, 469 F.2d 788 (3rd Cir, 1972).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Persons not in scope with no insurance. An RJA may assert a medical care claim against a soldier, civilian employee,
family member or retiree without insurance coverage with the approval of the Chief, Personnel Claims and Recovery
Division, USARCS, or designee. Approval will be granted if there are aggravating circumstances, such as willful
misconduct, and the tortfeasor has sufficient assets to satisfy both the injured victim and the Government's claim.

(d) Government contractors. Some contracts have ``cost-plus'' or reimbursement provisions which require the government
to reimburse the contractor for many types of expenses. If it appears that the contract would require the government
to reimburse a contractor for money recovered on an otherwise meritorious affirmative claim, the RJA will investigate
the claim and forward a recommendation to USARCS, referencing the specific contract clauses involved. The RJA will
assert other claims against government contractors after verifying that the contract does not contain a reimbursement
provision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) NG organizations and members. The RJA will investigate claims arising from the tortious conduct of NG members.
The RJA will assert claims against NG members and their insurers in accordance with &sect;536.218 (b) and (c). If the
NG members were acting within the scope of employment as State employees and an assertion against the NG organization's
insurer appears appropriate, the RJA will forward a recommendation to USARCS.

(a) Other regulations establish systems of property accountability and responsibility; and provide for the administrative
collection of charges from military and civilian personnel of the United States, and other individuals and legal
entities from whom collection may be made without litigation. However, when the investigation results in a preliminary
indication of pecuniary liability and no other method of collection is provided, the matter will be referred for action
under this subpart. Assertions may be made under this section for the loss, damage, or destruction of_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Property under DA control (AR 735&hyph;5).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Property of nonappropriated fund activities of the Army (except AAFES property unless a special agreement exists).
(See AR 215&hyph;1 and AR 215&hyph;2.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Claims for damage to property funded by civil functions appropriations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

owed by the United States to common carriers, contractors, and states.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Claims by the United States against carriers, warehousemen, insurers, and other third parties for amounts paid
in settlement of claims by members and employees of the Army or DOD for loss, damage, or destruction of personal property
while in transit or storage at Government expense (subpart K).

The RJA may accept the repair or replacement of the property in lieu of payment of the claim. The staff officer responsible
for the property must certify accomplishment of the repair or replacement (such as is described for motor vehicles
in AR 735&hyph;5) before a release may be executed. The authority conferred by this paragraph is not limited to incidents
involving motor vehicles.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Identification of potential claims. The RJA will ensure that installation motor pools, housing and engineering
staff sections, unit property custodians, and similar persons apprise the claims office of damage to DA property.
In addition, claims personnel will review MP blotters and reports, civilian news sources, reports of survey, magistrate
court proceedings, line of duty and AR 15&hyph;6 investigations, and similar reports to identify additional property
damage cases. A claims office designated as the NG point of contact for a state will coordinate with NG officials to
ensure that NG units appoint unit claims officers and report potential claims.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Transfer of responsibility. If another claims office is better situated to investigate and assert a property
damage claim, the claims office will coordinate with that office. The Chief, Affirmative Claims Branch, USARCS,
will resolve any disagreements. In addition, the office designated as the NG point of contact for a state will forward
potential claims arising in another office's area of responsibility to that office.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Investigation. Claims personnel will investigate potential incidents, question witnesses to determine the
facts and circumstances, and identify all available insurance coverage. Claims personnel may directly request
assistance from other DOD claims offices. Claims personnel may also request an investigation of an incident by a unit
claims officer for the unit or organization responsible for the damaged or destroyed property, or, when the investigation
may be more practically conducted by the claims officer of some other unit or organization, by another unit claims
officer. If no other report has been prepared, the unit claims officer will prepare DA Form 1208. Claims personnel
will obtain a breakdown of costs from the custodian of the property.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Closing potential claims without assertion. If the RJA determines that there is no tort liability or that the potential
recovery is too small to be worth pursuing, he or she will dispose of the notification without asserting a claim. If
a potential claim file was opened, claims personnel will annotate the basis for closing the potential claim on the
chronology sheet referencing the Federal Claims Collection Standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Asserting demands. If there is a legal and factual basis for the Government to recover, claims personnel should
notify both the tortfeasor and the tortfeasor's insurer. The assertion letter should outline the facts and cite the
Federal Claims Collection Act as the basis for recovery. The claims office may also cite local law. The claims office
should assert the claim for the full costs to the Government, if known, or state that the costs are still being ascertained.
Where appropriate, the assertion letter should also provide the option to repair the damaged property or to replace
it in kind.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Army claims offices assert claims against tortfeasors and insurers for medical and dental care which is furnished
to a soldier, family member or retiree at Army expense to treat an injury or disease resulting from tortious conduct.
In states that have modified traditional tort liability, Army claims offices also assert claims against insurers
other than health benefits insurers, such as no-fault and medical payments automobile insurers, and workers' compensation
funds. In doing so, claims offices coordinate their efforts with the injured party's efforts to recover other damages
from tortfeasors and insurers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Claims offices will forward potential claims for medical care furnished to service members, family members or
retirees of Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps or Coast Guard to the nearest installation or office of that service. As an
exception to this rule, however, claims offices may assert and collect claims for medical care provided to retirees
of another service and their dependents if:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) medical care was furnished at the local Army MTF; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) the incident giving rise to the claim occurred near the Army installation; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) the retiree resided near the Army installation. In these exceptional situations, the claims office must ensure
that the retiree is not receiving care at another service's MTF. The claims office must also notify USARCS as well as
the nearest installation or office of the retiree's service that it is handling the claim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) In some instances, the Army and the VA will both pay for care provided to a soldier or retiree. The VA, however, is
precluded from asserting claims for ``service-connected'' injuries. Accordingly:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If a soldier is injured and is discharged from the service, the claims office will assert claims for the reasonable
value of medical care furnished at Army expense (including care furnished in a VA facility) prior to a soldier's discharge.
Claims offices will not assert for the value of medical care furnished at VA expense, but the RJA will consider future
care provided by VA in determining whether to approve a waiver or compromise.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If a retiree is injured and receives some care paid for by the Army and other care in a VA facility, the claims office
will coordinate with the nearest VA office and assert a claim for the full value of the care provided. The office will
remit the amount recovered for care provided at VA expense to the VA.

Pursuant to the Federal Medical Care Recovery Act the Government may pursue recovery of medical costs under any of
the following tactics:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Subrogation. The United States is subrogated to any rights or claims held by a person to whom the Government has
provided medical care against the tortfeasor who caused him or her to be injured. As subrogee, the United States can
recover from the wrongdoer the reasonable value of the medical care it has furnished or will furnish the injured party.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Intervention. The United States can intervene in an injured party's suit against a tortfeasor or bring suit as
the assignee of an injured party's right of action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Independent Action. The United States can assert administratively and litigate a medical care claim in its own
name.

Identification of potential medical care recovery claims.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) By MTF personnel. (1) The MTF commander will ensure that the claims office is notified of instances where the MTF
provides or is billed by a civilian facility for inpatient or outpatient care resulting from injuries such as broken
bones or burns arising from automobile accidents, gas explosions, falls, civilian malpractice, and similar incidents
which do not involve collections from a health benefits or medicare supplemental insurer. Claims personnel will
coordinate with MTF personnel to ensure that inpatient and outpatient records, and emergency room and clinic logs
are properly screened to identify potential cases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The MTF commander will also ensure that the MTF does not release billings or medical records, or respond to requests
for assistance with worker's compensation forms, without coordinating with the RJA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) By CHAMPUS fiscal intermediaries. The CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary is required to identify and to promptly mail
claims involving certain diagnostic codes to the claims office designated as the state point of contact. The fiscal
intermediary is required to provide the contact office with a personal injury questionnaire completed by the injured
party and a copy of the CHAMPUS Explanation of Benefits showing the amount that CHAMPUS paid on the claim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) In accordance with chapter 5 of the CHAMPUS Fiscal Intermediary Operations Manual (September 1991), a fiscal
intermediary must suspend payment on a claim with possible medical care recovery until the injured party properly
completes the personal injury questionnaire. Within 15 working days after receiving and evaluating the completed
questionnaire, the fiscal intermediary is required to dispatch possible medical care recovery cases to the appropriate
claims office. The contact office must work with the fiscal intermediary to ensure that claims are properly identified
and forwarded in a timely manner. The claims office should document persistent problems and notify USARCS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (2) Prior to settlement of a CHAMPUS claim, claims offices should recontact the fiscal intermediary to ensure that
all amounts paid for by CHAMPUS are included in the Government's assertion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) By claims personnel. The RJA will ensure that MTF comptroller, clinic, and Patient Administration Division records
are screened to identify potential medical care recovery cases. The RJA will also coordinate with Navy and Air Force
claims offices and MTFs to ensure that they identify potential claims involving treatment provided to Army personnel.
To the extent possible claims personnel will review civilian police reports, military police blotters and reports,
news reports, magistrate court proceedings, line of duty and AR 15&hyph;6 investigations, and similar sources to
identify other potential medical care recovery claims.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Opening potential claims. Unless it is obvious from the notification documents that there is no potential recovery,
claims personnel will open a potential claims file on each incident identified. Until the Affirmative Claims Management
Program is revised to include a ``potentials database,'' potential claims will be recorded in the Claims Journal
(DD Form 1667).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Transfer of responsibility. (1) Several claims offices may be notified of incidents involving more than one injured
party or treatment at more than one facility. If an RJA has reason to believe that this has occurred, the RJA will contact
the other offices to determine which office has the most significant contacts and should assert the claim. The office
closest to where the injury occurred is not necessarily the office with the most significant contacts. In the event
that offices cannot agree, they will refer the matter to the Chief, Affirmative Claims Branch, USARCS for a decision.
The claims office will notify the MTF if it transfers responsibility for a claim that the MTF referred.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The office designated as the CHAMPUS or NG point of contact for a state will forward potential claims arising in
another office's area of responsibility to that office.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Investigation. If MTF personnel have not already collected the necessary information, claims personnel will
dispatch questionnaires to injured parties to determine the facts and circumstances and identify all available
insurance coverage. Claims personnel will obtain medical records and billings to determine the value of the Government's
claim, and will contact witnesses and consult with medical personnel as appropriate. RJAs may direct unit claims
officers to investigate incidents and may request assistance from other DOD claims offices as needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Closing potential claims without assertion. If the RJA determines that there is no tort liability or possible
recovery from an insurer or workers' compensation fund, or that the potential recovery is too small to be worth pursuing,
he or she will dispose of the notification without asserting a claim. If a potential claim file was opened, claims personnel
will annotate the basis for closing the potential claim on the chronology sheet. If an MTF provided the notification,
claims personnel will return the notification with a dated and signed notation, ``Per RJA, no third party recovery.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Asserting demands. If there is a legal and factual basis for the Government to recover, claims personnel will assert
a demand against each tortfeasor and insurer. Claims personnel should place tortfeasors and insurers on written
notice of the Government's right to recover even if the injured party's attorney enters into a representation agreement
(see &sect;536.226(b)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Automobile case_tort liability. If care was wholly or partly provided in an MTF on or after 5 November 1990, the
claims office will assert demands against the tortfeasor and his insurer citing both the FMCRA and 10 U.S.C. 1095.
If care was provided in a civilian hospital or was provided before 5 November 1990, the office will only cite the FMCRA
as a basis for recovery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Automobile cases_no tort liability. If care was wholly or partly provided in an MTF on or after 5 November 1990,
the claims office will assert demands against the injured party's Personal Injury Protection (PIP), medical payments,
or no-fault insurance citing 10 U.S.C. 1095. If care was provided in a civilian hospital or was provided before 5 November
1990, the office will cite applicable state insurance law recognizing the United States as a third party beneficiary
of an injured party's automobile insurance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Automobile cases_multiple sources of recovery. If the claims office can recover from the tortfeasor's automobile
liability and from the injured party's non-liability coverage, the claims office should put both insurers on notice
of the claim and should first attempt to collect from the no-fault insurer. If the tortfeasor is an uninsured motorist
and the injured party has uninsured/underinsured motorists' coverage, the claims office should attempt to recover
from the injured party's insurer while following the procedures in &sect;536.228(a). See &sect;536.227(e) if the
injured party has health benefits insurance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Special rules applicable to CHAMPUS ``primary payers.'' Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1079(j)(1) and 1086(g), workers'
compensation and the injured party's no-fault, PIP, medical payments, and uninsured/underinsured motorist's
coverage are considered ``primary'' to CHAMPUS. Before the fiscal intermediary pays the injured party's medical
bills and notifies the claims office to assert a claim against the tortfeasor, the fiscal intermediary is required
to verify that these ``primary payers'' have paid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If the fiscal intermediary overlooks such coverage, the claims office will immediately assert a demand against
the injured party's insurer (or the workers' compensation fund) citing 10 U.S.C. 1079(j)(1) in addition to other
sources of authority. If the insurer has already disbursed the policy limits to the injured party, the claims office
will request repayment from the injured party. The claims office will return money recovered in this manner to CHAMPUS
(see &sect;536.231(d)(3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the injured party or the injured party's insurer decline to pay and the claims office does not recover the full
amount asserted from the tortfeasor's liability insurer, the claims office will forward the file to USARCS, which
will refer the matter to the OCHAMPUS General Counsel. In this instance, the claims office will not waive or compromise
any portion of the Government's claim because of undue hardship to the injured party without the approval of Chief,
Personnel Claims and Recovery Division, USARCS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) On-the-job injuries. In states that recognize the United States as a beneficiary of state workers' compensation
systems, the claims office will present a claim to the appropriate office.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Other injuries. Other instances giving rise to third party liability include gas explosions, malpractice by
civilian physicians, slip-and-fall incidents, and product liability cases. Claims offices will assert demands
against the tortfeasor and his insurer citing the FMCRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Determination of the amount asserted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) MTF costs. Recovery for MTF care is presently based upon multiple ``clinical group'' per diem inpatient rates
and a single per visit outpatient rate established by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Claims personnel
should obtain a billing from each MTF. The RJA should, however, obtain information from the MTF registrar and adjust
the amount asserted if it appears that the billings include inpatient days where the injured party was retained in
the MTF for administrative purposes rather than medical needs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) CHAMPUS costs. Recovery for inpatient care provided in civilian hospitals and paid through CHAMPUS is based upon
the CHAMPUS ``Diagnosis Related Group'' (DRG) rates, regardless of the ``actual'' costs. Rates for outpatient care
are based on the CHAMPUS ``allowable charge'' for that medical service. Claims offices should assert for the amount
that CHAMPUS paid even though this can sometimes exceed the amount that the civilian hospital billed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Ambulance services. Ambulance and air ambulance services provided to soldiers, family members and retirees
are ``medical costs'' within the meaning of the FMCRA and 10 U.S.C. 1095, but they are not included in the OMB rates.
Claims offices should try to obtain a specific breakdown of costs from the MTF or the unit providing the services and
include these in the amount asserted.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) Burial expenses. If a soldier dies from injuries received and is buried at Government expense, the installation
Mortuary Affairs Office completes DD Form 2063 and itemizes expense data on this form. While burial expenses are not
``medical care'' within the meaning of the FMCRA or 10 U.S.C. 1095, many insurance policies provide for the payment
of such expenses. Claims offices may assert a demand for burial expenses incurred by the Government if the insurance
contract provides for payment of such expenses and state law recognizes the United States as a third party beneficiary
of the contract. Claims personnel should, however, be extra sensitive to the possibility that the insurance proceeds
might be inadequate and should consider waiving or compromising the Government's claim in appropriate cases to avoid
undue hardship to the deceased injured party's next of kin.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The United States has a right to recover the reasonable value of medical care that has been furnished or will be furnished
in the future.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The injured party is required to cooperate with the United States by providing a complete statement of the facts
and circumstances surrounding the injury, information about any legal action brought against any prospective defendant,
and information about and copies of any insurance policies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The injured party should not execute a release or settle any claims without notifying the RJA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(b) Claims personnel should attempt to coordinate action to collect the claim of the United States with the injured
party's action to collect his or her own claim against a tortfeasor or insurer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The RJA may enter into a written agreement with the injured party's attorney to assert the Government's claim and
to include it as an item of special damages if the injured party sues. The agreement must state that the Government will
not pay counsel fees, and that the attorney will not compute his fee based on the Government's portion of any recovery.
The agreement must also state that the Government must be consulted regarding any potential compromise and must agree
to any settlement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The RJA should coordinate with the injured party's attorney to ensure that any request for compromise or waiver
of the Government's claim is considered as far in advance of settlement as is practical.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) The RJA may arrange to make local witnesses available for the injured party's attorney. With approval from USARCS,
the RJA may arrange to make other Army witnesses available for the injured party's attorney if it is in the Government's
best interests to do so. Any such request must be submitted as far in advance as practical. The appearance of present
and former DA military and civilian personnel as witnesses is governed by AR 27&hyph;40, Chapter 7.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The RJA should immediately terminate a representation agreement and independently pursue the Government's
right to recover if the injured party's interests conflict with the Government's interests, or if the injured party's
attorney fails to keep the RJA informed of developments or otherwise acts in a manner inconsistent with representing
the Government's interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If the injured party or his attorney fails to cooperate with the claims office, the RJA is authorized to direct the
MTF personnel to withhold billing information and should vigorously pursue the Government's right to recover. In
addition, as outlined in 32 CFR 537.23, the RJA is authorized to direct the MTF to withhold release of medical records
until the injured party provides the statement and other information required by &sect;536.226(a)(2); the RJA may
not, however, direct the MTF to withhold medical records if the injured party's attorney merely refuses to enter into
a representation agreement. In appropriate cases, the claims office should intervene in pending litigation.

(d) If the injured party's attorney improperly withholds or disburses money collected on behalf of the Government,
the RJA should immediately initiate action to recover the money owed through litigation or through State disciplinary
proceedings after appropriate coordination in accordance with AR 27&hyph;40 and AR 27&hyph;1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Claims personnel may obtain an assignment from the injured party or his attorney for the reasonable value of the
care that the United States provided if this will facilitate collection. The absence of an assignment does not affect
the Government's independence right under the FMCRA, however, and an assignment is normally not necessary.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOD Claims offices and MTFs manage complementary programs to recover for medical care furnished at DOD expense. Pursuant
to a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the Judge Advocate General and The Surgeon General and understandings
with Navy and Air Force authorities, claims offices and MTF's support each other's recovery programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) As provided in the MOA, claims offices will recover from automobile insurers, while MTFs will recover from health
benefits and medicare supplemental insurance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) As provided in the MOA, MTFs will obtain insurance and other relevant information from persons receiving inpatient
and outpatient treatment for injuries resulting from an accident. MTF personnel will also screen emergency room
logs, clinic records, and patient admission information to identify accident cases. MTFs will refer these cases
to claims offices in a timely manner, assist claims offices in obtaining medical records and cost computations, and
route requests for medical records from injured parties and attorneys through the RJA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) In return, claims offices will notify the MTFs of the final disposition of cases referred, deposit money recovered
under 10 U.S.C. 1095 to the operations and maintenance account of the MTF that provided the care (see &sect;536.231(d)),
and report the amounts deposited to an MTF's account on a monthly basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) As provided in the MOA, the head of each claims office may enter into a local Memorandum of Agreement with his or her
supporting Army MTF commander. Such agreements should cover procedures, the degree of staffing each office will
provide, and time frames for providing records or information. Such agreements may also provide for the MTF to assist
the claims office's medical care recovery effort, either by giving back money deposited by the claims office into
the MTF's Operations &amp; Maintenance fund to the claims office, or by providing personnel or other support. Any
personnel provided or money returned to the claims office under such an agreement will only be used to support affirmative
claims collection efforts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) If care was wholly or partly provided in an MTF on or after 5 November 1990 and recovery is possible from both a health
benefits insurer and an automobile insurer, the MTF will first attempt to collect from the health insurer. If the MTF
cannot recover the full value of the Government's claim from the health insurer, the MTF will foward the claim file
to the installation claims office for collection from the automobile insurer.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Uninsured Motorists. If the tortfeasor is an uninsured motorist, affirmative claims personnel will assert a
demand against the tortfeasor, and will request suspension of the tortfeasor's driving and registration privileges
under a State financial responsibility law if the tortfeasor does not pay promptly. If collection from the tortfeasor
is not feasible, claims personnel will pursue recovery from any State uninsured motorist's fund or, on a medical care
claim, from the injured party's uninsured motorist's coverage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Periodic review of pending claims. Whether or not the injured party's attorney has agreed to assert the Government's
claim, claims personnel will review the status of pending claims every 60 days and take follow-up action as appropriate.
Claims personnel should periodically contact the injured party's attorney to determine the status of pending cases,
and should call or send follow-up letters to an insurer or tortfeasor who fails to respond to a demand or provides an
unacceptable response. Follow-up action should be documented on the claims chronology sheet.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Adjusting the amount asserted. The RJA should adjust the amount asserted on a claim as further treatment is provided.
The RJA should delay settlement if it appears that extensive treatment is necessary or should consider this in negotiating
a settlement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Forwarding claims to higher authorities. The RJA or head of a claims office will terminate action or will act on
requests for waiver or offers to compromise that are within his or her settlement authority (see &sect;536.216).
If a higher settlement authority must act on the claim, the RJA will forward a completed worksheet to the area claims
office (if that office has authority to take action) or to USARCS as appropriate. When time is of the essence in securing
a settlement, an RJA may contact USARCS telephonically for authorization to waive or compromise a claim. Prior to
the expiration of the statute of limitations, the RJA should contact USARCS for guidance on disposing of any claim
which cannot be recovered in full, compromised, terminated or litigated.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Claims personnel will reflect the basis for any settlements other than payment in full in the claims file. Note that
under some circumstances, settlement authority may not waive or compromise a claim that he or she would normally have
authority to act on (see &sect;536.216(g)).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Payment in full.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A settlement authority may settle a medical care or property damage claim by recovering the full amount the Government's
claim as a lump sum, through installment payments, or as a repair in kind on a property damage claim. An offer for the
full amount of available insurance would not ``pay in full'' a claim asserted for a greater amount, and the RJA would
have to follow compromise procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Compromise.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) If there are difficulties in recovering on a medical care or property damage claim (as defined by part 4 CFR part
103 of the Federal Claims Collection Standards), a settlement authority may accept less than the amount asserted
from a tortfeasor or insurer for the convenience of the government. Acceptable bases for compromise for the convenience
of the government include inability of the tortfeasor to pay, insufficient insurance, probability that the government
will be unable to prove its case, or collection costs which are not commensurate with the amount being compromised.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the injured party or the injured party's attorney requests waiver or compromise of a medical care claim, a settlement
authority may accept an amount less than the amount asserted to equitably apportion the available funds and avoid
undue hard-ship to the injured party. To do so, the settlement authority must consider the fair value of the injured
party's claim, the future value of care provided by the United States, and the potential recovery available. In evaluating
a request, the settlement authority may consider an offer by the injured party's attorney to reduce his or her fee,
but should not make this a condition for granting a request. Prior to approval of any compromise based on undue hardship,
the injured party must provide the following information:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Detailed information on what funds are available for recovery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Reasonable value of the injured party's claim for permanent injury, pain and suffering, decreased earning power,
and any other items of special damages.

. If there are difficulties in recovering on a medical care or property damage claim (as defined by 4 CFR part 104.3 of
the Federal Claims Collection Standards), a settlement authority may close the claim without recovery for the convenience
of the Government. Acceptable bases for terminating collection action include lack of legal merit to the claim, lack
of evidence to substantiate the claim, costs of recovery which will exceed the amount recoverable, or inability to
locate the debtor in instances where the likelihood of collection is too remote to justify retention of the file.

Waiver
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If the injured party or the injured party's attorney requests waiver or compromise of the government's claim, a settlement
authority may close a medical care claim without recovery where collection of any part of the government's claim will
result in undue hardship to the injured party. Prior to granting a request for waiver, the settlement authority will
consider the factors outlined in &sect;536.229(b)(2) and require the injured party to provide the items listed in
&sect;536.229(b)(2) (i) thru (vii). Property damage claims cannot be ``waived.''

Litigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a tortfeasor or insurer refuses to settle, or if an injured party's attorney improperly withholds funds, the RJA
must consider litigation to protect the interests of the United States. Litigation is particularly appropriate
if a particular insurer consistently refuses to settle claims, or if the Government's interests are not adequately
represented on a large claim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) RJA's must maintain close contact with local U.S. Attorney's offices to ensure that these offices are willing
to initiate litigation on cases. RJA's are encouraged to obtain appointments as Special Assistant U.S. Attorneys.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) In order to directly initiate or intervene in litigation, an RJA must prepare a litigation report and formally
refer the case through the Affirmative Claims Branch, USARCS and the Litigation Division, OTJAG (as required by AR
27&hyph;40, chapter 5) to the U.S. Attorney. While the RJA should attempt to initiate litigation well before the expiration
of the statute of limitations, the RJA may contact USARCS telephonically if statute of limitations problems necessitate
quick action on a case. The RJA should also contact USARCS if a U.S. Attorney is reluctant to pursue an important case.
An injured party's attorney may represent the Government's interest in litigation without any special coordination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The Department of Justice requires all cases involving damage to government property of $200,000 and under to
go through the Department of Justice Central Intake Facility in Silver Spring, Maryland, before going to a United
States attorney for litigation. Forward the agency referral package cover sheet and all documentation normally
provided to the U.S. Attorney on all such cases to USARCS, which in turn will forward them to the Central Intake Facility
through the Litigation Division, Office of the Judge Advocate General, as appropriate.

printed as Figure 9&hyph;1, DA Pam 27&hyph;162. The RJA may not, however, execute any kind of indemnity agreement,
nor may the RJA execute a release which prejudices the Government's right to recover on other claims arising out of
the same incident without the approval of the Chief, Personnel Claims and Recovery Division, USARCS. In addition,
the RJA may not execute a release that purports to release any claim that the injured party may have other than for medical
care furnished or to be furnished by the United States. The RJA will not execute a release if the Government's claim
is waived or terminated.

an automobile insurer for medical care provided in an MTF on or after 5 November 1990 in the Operations &amp; Maintenance
account of the Army, Navy or Air Force MTF that provided the care. Offices will deposit money recovered from all types
of automobile insurance, including liability insurance, to MTF accounts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
To the General Treasury
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Money recovered directly from tortfeasors, from workers' compensation funds, from insurance other than automobile
insurance (such as homeowner's insurance), from automobile insurers for care provided in an MTF prior to 5 November
1990, or from automobile insurers for care provided in a civilian hospital will be deposited in the Miscellaneous
Receipts Account, 21R3210.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Apportioning medical care recovery between accounts. Only money recovered under the provisions of 10 U.S.C.
1095 can be deposited into an MTF account. Claims offices will often have to apportion money recovered among different
accounts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Apportioning money between MTF accounts and the General Treasury. Deposit money recovered from an automobile
insurer for care provided prior to 5 November 1990 or provided in a civilian hospital to the General Treasury. Deposit
money recovered for care provided in an MTF after that date to the MTF's account. If the amount recovered is less than
the amount asserted, deposit money to the MTF's account first, and deposit any remaining money to the General Treasury.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Apportioning money between two or more MTF accounts. If care was provided by two or more MTF's on or after 5 November
1990, and the claims office recovers less than the amount asserted, the claims office should give each MTF a pro rata
share of the money recovered. For example, if MTF1 provided $2,000 worth of care and MTF2 provided $1,000 worth of care,
the claims office will deposit $800 of a $1,200 recovery to MTF1's account and the remaining $400 to MTF2's account.

for personnel claims, for affirmative claims, and for tort and special claims, corresponding to the automated claims
data management programs for such claims, using the April 1988 version of this form. Each event requiring entry in
the journal will be recorded immediately upon receipt of information as to its occurrence. Use of the journal for personnel

events (PCE) for every incident which it (or a unit claims officer) has investigated, or has received a copy of a report
of incident or report of investigation from a unit claims officer or any other source. Similar files will be maintained
for incidents investigated by a claims office or other Army official that might give rise to an affirmative claim in
favor of the Army. The investigative file will be merged into a claims file when a claim is filed or asserted. Investigative
files not otherwise merged into a claims file will be retained until transferred to another Army claims office or until
the time for filing a claim has expired.

(a) The Commander, USARCS, is the proper authority for post settlement review of claims against the United States.
Claims having the following file numbers under AR 25&hyph;400&hyph;2 will be forwarded to USARCS (subject to the
provisions of b and c below) for disposition under the regulation: 27&hyph;20a, 27&hyph;20g, 27&hyph;20h, 27&hyph;20i,
27&hyph;20j, or 27&hyph;20q. Claims having other 27&hyph;20 file numbers will be disposed locally according to
the instructions in AR 25&hyph;400&hyph;2.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Files of completed tort claims will not be forwarded to the Commander, USARCS prior to the expiration of any appeal
period or the 6-month period for filing suit, as applicable. The file of a tort claim in which an award that is final is
not accepted by the claimant, within a reasonable time, will also be forwarded.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) For personnel claims involving recovery action, claims files will be assembled and processed for local recovery
action or forwarded for centralized recovery action in accordance with DA Pam 27&hyph;162, chapter 3, &sect;&sect;536.195
and 536.196. After completion of final recovery action by field claims offices or command claims services such files
will be forwarded to USARCS for retirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Files will be administratively closed as abandoned or withdrawn and forwarded to the Commander, USARCS, as provided
herein.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Personnel claims. Claims under subpart K will be administratively closed as abandoned in the following situations:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The claimant affirmatively withdraws or abandons the claim prior to adjudication. Such files will contain evidence
of the claimant's intention to do so, such as a letter from the claimant or a memorandum of a telephone conversation
with the claimant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The claimant cannot be located to be paid or, if the claim is not fully substantiated, to have his or her intentions
with regard to the claim ascertained (but, see paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) For other reasons, final action on the claim cannot be taken.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) When a claimant has neither affirmatively abandoned nor fully substantiated a claim cognizable under subpart
K, he or she should be directed by certified mail to provide the required substantiation within a specified period,
usually 30 days. If correspondence is returned as undeliverable, and the claimant is an active duty service member,
a current military address can usually be obtained from the Commander, U.S. Army Enlisted Records and Evaluation
Center, Army Worldwide Locator Service, ATTN: PCRE&hyph;RF, Fort Benjamin Harrison, IN 46249&hyph;5301. If the
claimant fails to respond, to the extent that the claim is substantiated and meritorious it should be paid; otherwise,
it should be disapproved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Tort claims. Each file will contain evidence of claimant's intention to withdraw or abandon the claim, such as
a letter or a memorandum for record of a telephone conversation with claimant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Before apparently abandoned claims are forwarded to USARCS, a certified letter should be sent to the claimant
requesting, his/her intentions within a specified period, usually 30 days. If no reply is received within a reasonable
time, usually 30 days, the files may be closed and forwarded to USARCS, except as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Tort claims under subparts D, E and F. Additionally, a paragraph of the letter should state that failure to respond
will result in the presumption that the claim is abandoned. Further, it should be stated that if the claimant is dissatisfied
with the action taken, the claimant may file suit in an appropriate United States District Court no later than six months
from the date of mailing of the letter, or the claimant's remedy will be forever barred.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) In tort claims under subpart C, the last paragraph should advise the claimant that failure to respond will result
in the presumption that the claim is abandoned, and that if the claimant is dissatisfied with the action taken, the
claimant has a right to appeal the action for a review and final decision. Further, it should be stated that the claimant
only has 60 days to submit such an appeal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Only after each of the above actions has been completed, may a tort claim be considered to be abandoned, and be forwarded
to USARCS for retirement. If correspondence to a claimant is returned as undelivered, and the claimant is an active
duty service member, a current military address can usually be obtained from the Commander, U.S. Army Enlisted Records
and Evaluation Center, Army Worldwide Locator Service, ATTN: PCRE&hyph;RF, Fort Benjamin Harrison, IN 46249&hyph;5301.

(a) Field claims offices will occasionally have need of a file that has been sent to USARCS for centralized recovery
or retirement (for example, action on a ``late'' reconsideration request). When requesting the return of a file from
USARCS (either in writing or telephonically), the requesting office must provide_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The claim number.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The claimant's name.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Whether the file was forwarded for retirement or centralized recovery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The reason the file is being requested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If USARCS has already acted on a request for reconsideration on a personnel claim, the file will not be returned
to a field office for action on a second request for reconsideration. In such cases, the request will be sent to USARCS
for action.

(a) The contents of each claim file for claims against the United States will be placed in a standard 91/4 inch by 113/4
inch manila folder. The name of the claimant, exactly as entered into the automated claims management data base, will
be placed on the top-left portion of the file folder. The complete nine-digit computer-generated claim number displayed
in the automated database will be placed on the extreme top right-hand side of the folder. The fiscal year, office code,
and claim sequence number will be separated by a dash mark (example, ``88&hyph;011&hyph;0079''). Both name and claim
file number entries on the manila file folder will be printed legibly in blue-black ink. The claim file should be stapled
together before inserting in the file folder; however, the file need only be placed in the folder without stapling
to the file folder.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Investigative files will also be maintained in manila folders. The date of the incident and general descriptive
data (for example, ``1 Jul 86/auto accident (1st and Elm, Smallville)'' or ``24 Sep 86/heart operation (Jones, John
M.)'') will be placed on top-left portion of the file folder.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) AR 25&hyph;400&hyph;2 requires labeling of file folders and containers with specific information. In complying
therewith, the following guidance is provided:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When labeling individual file folders, only the information required by AR 25&hyph;400&hyph;2 will be typed
on the label. The label will be placed on the top center portion of the folder. Under no circumstances will the information
concerning the claim (see paragraph (a) of this section) be placed on this label.

(a) The Personnel Claims Management Program, the Affirmative Claims Management Program, and the Tort and Special
Claims Management Program are the automated programs which generate a monthly status report on claims against the
United States and recovery actions. Specific instructions pertaining to the USARCS Claims Automation Program are
contained in DA PAM 27&hyph;162, chapter 1 and in documentation provided with the automation software.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The data contained in the USARCS Claims Automation Program and the monthly claims office status reports generated
by the automation software provide the data necessary to make sound management decisions by claims officers, by heads
of area claims offices, by SJAs responsible for OCONUS command claims services, and by the Commander, USARCS. The
system provides a uniform method of assignment of claim file numbers to permit identification and retrieval of individual
claim files, identifies delay in claims processing, and permits worldwide management control of all claims against
the Government. The automated monthly reports forwarded to USARCS provide the data base used for the preparation
of claims budgetary status reports and periodic budget estimates to the USAFAC as well as to the Office of the Assistant
Secretary of the Army (Financial Management). It is the responsibility of all claims office personnel to ensure that
automated claims records are complete and accurate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) This section does not apply to the reporting of reimbursement obligations to foreign countries pursuant to the
NATO&hyph;SOFA or other similar treaties or agreements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The Commander, USARCS, will furnish software and documentation for the Personnel Claims Management Program,
the Affirmative Claims Management Program, and the Tort and Special Claims Management Program, with updated versions
as required. These are the only programs authorized for recording and reporting claims in the Army Claims System.
Local modification of these programs is not authorized.

Reporting requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The head of each area claims office and command claims service will ensure that a monthly computer-generated claims
report is prepared for each claims office with an office code within his or her area of responsibility and for each Foreign
Claims Commission using the automation programs provided by USARCS. The report(s) (tort claims only) and diskettes
containing current claims data base(s) (for all programs) will be posted to USARCS by the fifth calendar day of the
month. In addition, a copy of any archive disk prepared during the reporting period will be forwarded for processing.
Whenever possible, the data should be sent using a modem or other electronic data transfer system. Claims offices
under the jurisdiction of a command claims service will forward their report(s) and diskettes through the command
claims service and will comply with any additional reporting requirements of the command claims service. Diskettes
must be marked with the office name, the office code, the type of claim record, the disk sequence number, the month and
year, and the data base file name(s) contained in the diskette (for example, Fort Blank, 001, Tort Claims, 1 of 1, Mar
89, T9000103.1DB). Detailed instructions on the preparation of the monthly automated claims report and claims data
diskettes are contained in DA PAM 27&hyph;162, chapter 12 and program documentation. If there are no changes from
the previous month in the Affirmative Claims reports, the Personnel Claims report, or the Tort and Special Claims
report, a negative report will be submitted within the stated time guidelines.

USARCS will provide field claims offices with monthly error reports listing claims records that cannot be loaded
into the USARCS data base due to data entry errors or omissions. Errors listed on the error reports must be corrected
as soon as possible; resubmission of the corrected claims records will occur at the time of the next regular monthly
reporting cycle.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Reporting. Quarterly, each command claims service or office authorized to assert affirmative claims will submit
a copy of the ``Previous Three Months'' report generated by the Affirmative Claims Management Program to USARCS,
ATTN: JACS&hyph;PCA. Command claims services and offices will identify these reports by quarter and fiscal year
(i.e., ``1st Qtr, FY 93'') and forward them so that they arrive not later than the 7th calendar day of every quarter (i.e.,
7 January, 7 April, 7 July, and 7 October each year). Offices authorized to assert affirmative claims which have no
affirmative claims activity in a given quarter will forward negative reports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Routing. Area claims offices and claims processing offices will forward these reports directly to USARCS through
the senior Judge Advocate in the office, for example, the SJA. Claims processing offices will forward an additional
copy to their area claims offices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Special preparation instructions. Offices may manually correct any errors in the computer generated report
using the following guidelines:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Claims first asserted in an indefinite amount will be reported in the period in which a reasonably accurate figure
can first be determined.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When reporting the number of claims collected during the report period, only the first collection will be counted
for claims in which payments are received in installments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) When reporting the total dollar amount collected during the reporting period, include any installments. The
dollar value of any replacement or property repair should be included in the total with the replacement or repair value
portion noted.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Dollars obligated for personnel and tort claims fiscal year to date (through the end of the prior month) and the
total number of personnel and tort claims paid fiscal year to date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Dollars deposited during the prior month.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Ensure that the report of dollars deposited for the month and year to date includes only funds deposited is one of the
claims appropriation accounts. Do not include money recovered through the affirmative claims program and deposited
with miscellaneous receipts of the U.S. Treasury.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(5) Dollars deposited year to date through prior month. (See note at paragraph (a)(4) of this section.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The report submitted at the beginning of August every year will also include the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The total CEA furnished to that office up to that time (initial CEA plus or minus any changes).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The CEA balance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The amount the office expects to be able to obligate in the remaining 2 months of the fiscal year if sufficient funds
are available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The expected surplus or shortfall.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) A proposed CEA for the next fiscal year and the rationale for any unusual increases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Solatia payment.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Payment of solatia in accordance with local custom as an expression of sympathy toward a victim or his or her family
is common in overseas commands (see DA PAM 27&hyph;162, chapter 8). Such payments are not to be made from the claims
CEA. These payments are made from local operation and maintenance funds pursuant to directives established by the
appropriate commander for the country concerned. This applies even where a command claims service is directed to
administer the command's solatia program.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 HUD has issued regulations implementing the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act
of 1974 and providing for consumer complaint handling and remedial actions. The regulations require that when a manufacturer
receives information that may indicate the existence of a problem in a manufactured home for which the manufacturer
is responsible for providing notification, the manufacturer must conduct investigations and inspections to determine
whether it must notify consumers and dealers and, possibly, correct affected homes. Some manufacturers are not adequately
carrying out their responsibilities under the regulations. Accordingly, the Department finds it necessary to reiterate,
through this Interpretative Bulletin, its policy with regard to the regulations.

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has issued regulations implementing the National Manufactured
Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974, 42 U.S.C. 5401 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Manufactured Home Procedural and Enforcement Regulations (``Regulations''), in part, provide for consumer
complaint handling and remedial actions. 24 CFR part 3282, subpart I.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3282.404(b) of the regulations (24 CFR 3282.404(b)) provides that whenever the manufacturer receives from
any source information that may indicate the existence of a problem in a manufactured home for which the manufacturer
is responsible for providing notification under &sect;3282.404(a), the manufacturer is required, as soon as possible,
but not later than 20 days after receipt of the information, to carry out any necessary investigations and inspections
to determine whether the manufacturer is responsible for providing notification under &sect;3282.404(a). The
manufacturer is further required to maintain complete records of all such information and determinations in a form
that will allow the Secretary, the Secretary's Agent or a State Administrative Agency (``SAA'') readily to discern
who made the determination with respect to a particular piece of information, what the determination was, and the
basis for the determination. Such records are required to be kept for a minimum of five years from the date the manufacturer
received the information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3282.404(a) of the Regulations (24 CFR 3282.404(a)) requires notification of consumers and dealers when
the manufacturer has information that a Defect 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
exists 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
or 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
may exist 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in a class of manufactured homes produced by the manufacturer. Notification of consumers and dealers is also required
with respect to all manufactured homes produced by the manufacturer in which there exists or may exist an Imminent
Safety Hazard or Serious Defect. In the case of Imminent Safety Hazards and Serious Defects, correction of the affected
homes is also required under 24 CFR 3282.406.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department's policy with regard to &sect;3282.404 of the Regulations has been consistent since the inception
of the manufactured housing program and has been espoused at SAA and Primary Inspection Agency (``PIA'') workshops
and in materials distributed to SAAs, PIAs, and manufacturers at those workshops. Notwithstanding, it has come to
the Department's attention that some manufacturers are not making the required determinations for each problem
or maintaining complete records of the determinations if they are being made. In some cases, manufacturers are making
one determination for an unrelated group of problems in a home. Therefore, the Department finds it necessary, in light
of this apparent noncompliance, to reiterate the policy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Department of Housing and Urban Development interprets 24 CFR 3282.404(b) as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whenever the manufacturer receives from any source (including, but not limited to: Home purchasers or owners, dealers,
PIAs, SAAs, component suppliers and the manufacturer's own employees) information that may indicate the existence
of a Noncompliance, Defect, Serious Defect or Imminent Safety Hazard in a manufactured home, the manufacturer shall,
as soon as possible, but not later than 20 days after receipt of the information, carry out any necessary investigations
and inspections to determine whether the manufacturer is responsible for providing notification under 24 CFR 3282.404(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If, on its face, the information clearly indicates the problem is a Noncompliance, the manufacturer shall make the
determination that notification is not required and need not do anything further unless required, by the Secretary
or an SAA, to notify consumers and dealers pursuant to 24 CFR 3282.407. However, the manufacturer must keep complete
records of such information, the determination, and the basis for that determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If, however, the information indicates that the problem in the manufactured home is or 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
may be 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a Defect, Serious Defect or Imminent Safety Hazard, the manufacturer shall carry out necessary investigations and
inspections to determine the extent and seriousness of the problem. The manufacturer shall then make a determination
whether notification (and correction) is required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In some cases, what the problem is will not be apparent from the face of the information. For example, a consumer complaint
about a crack in the wallboard may, at first glance, appear to be a nonstandard cosmetic item. However, upon further
investigation, it may become apparent that the crack is a symptom of a structural problem. Such a structural problem
may be a Serious Defect resulting from an improper design and may have been incorporated into numerous homes. Therefore,
the manufacturer must thoroughly investigate and consider all the information it receives or already has in its possession
and must obtain any additional information necessary to make the determination. In making the class determination,
the manufacturer must review relevant information to determine whether it has produced other homes that have or may
have the same problem (for example: prior consumer complaints, PIA inspection records, information from suppliers,
information from dealers, designs, quality control records, etc.). In determining what records of other homes should
be reviewed to look for similar problems, the manufacturer may need to pay close attention to homes with similar characteristics
to the home known to have the problem (for example: similar models, homes with similar options or construction, homes
containing components similar to the subject home, etc.).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If it is questionable whether a particular home definitely is in or not in a class of affected homes, the manufacturer
should presume that the home is affected and treat it as part of the class. Moreover, even if a home has been corrected
by a third party, the manufacturer is still responsible for conducting the necessary investigations and making the
necessary determinations. Under 24 CFR 3282.366(b), the Production Inspection Primary Inspection Agency (IPIA)
is responsible for reviewing a determination with regard to a class of potentially affected homes including the determination
of whether or not a class exists. In addition, both IPIAs and Design Approval Primary Inspection Agencies are responsible
for assisting the Secretary or an SAA in identifying the class of manufactured homes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The manufacturer shall maintain complete records of all such information and determinations in a form that will allow
the Secretary, the Secretary's agent, or an SAA readily to discern who made the determination with respect to a particular
piece of information, what the determination was, and the full basis for the determination (not merely a conclusion).
Such basis must include a description of and the findings from the investigations and inspections the manufacturer
carried out to determine whether notification (and correction) is required and whether the Defect, Serious Defect,
or Imminent Safety Hazard is or 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
may be 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in a class of homes. Often, this will require that the manufacturer determine the source of the problem. Such records
must be kept for a minimum of five years from the date the manufacturer received the information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Failure to comply with the requirements of Subpart I of the Regulations and this Interpretative Bulletin may subject
the manufacturer to civil and criminal penalties under 42 U.S.C. 5410, and a possible action for injunctive relief
under 42 U.S.C. 5411. Similar actions may be brought by SAAs under their State statutory authorities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This Interpretative Bulletin is issued pursuant to 24 CFR 3282.113. The Secretary has received requests from State
officials urging immediate action on this matter, because of the difficulty they are finding in monitoring the manufacturers'
compliance with the Regulations and ultimately protecting the public. In addition and as noted above, this Interpretative
Bulletin does not denote any change in policy held by the Department. Therefore, due to the need for expeditious resolution
of these issues and the fact that this is not a change in the position or policy of the Department, the Secretary deems
it not to be in the public interest to issue the interpretation for public comment in the
