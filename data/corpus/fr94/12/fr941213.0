SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) is adopting the interim final rule which was published on October 19, 1994,
as a final rule without change. The rule provides policies and procedures, required under subsections (c)(3) of section
21A of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act, for the marketing of properties under the Affordable Housing Disposition Program
(AHDP). The rule is necessary because the Resolution Trust Corporation Refinancing, Restructuring and Improvement
Act of 1991 (Refinancing Act), the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development and Independent
Agencies Appropriations Act of 1992 (1992 Appropriations Act), the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992
(1992 Housing Act) and the Resolution Trust Corporation Completion Act of 1993 (Completion Act) changed the manner
in which the RTC is to identify, market and sell certain properties under the AHDP. This rule also clarifies certain
policies of the RTC regarding the disposition of assets in the AHDP and reflects certain comments received with respect
to a previously published interim final rule. By implementing the statutory changes required by the Refinancing
Act, the 1992 Appropriations Act, the 1992 Housing Act, and the Completion Act, and clarifying certain provisions
of the AHDP and making the other changes set forth herein, these regulations will enhance the availability and affordability
of residential real property for very-low income, lower-income and moderate-income families and individuals.

Regulatory Procedure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On August 31, 1990 (55 FR 35564), the RTC published a final rule establishing the procedures to be followed by the RTC
in connection with the sale of eligible residential properties to qualifying purchasers under the AHDP. Those procedures
were established in accordance with the affordable housing provisions of section 21A(c) of the Federal Home Loan
Bank Act, as amended be section 501 of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA)
(12 U.S.C. 1441a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 6, 1992 (57 FR 19500), the RTC published an interim final rule and requested comments (May 6, 1992 Interim Rule).
That publication implemented some of the statutory changes made to the AHDP by the Refinancing Act and clarified the
RTC's policies on a number of issues relating to the disposition of assets in the AHDP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On June 12, 1992 (57 FR 24937), the RTC published an interim statement of policy titled Lower Income Occupancy Requirements
for Bulk Sales in the Multifamily Affordable Housing Disposition Program. That publication provided that when more
than one multifamily property is purchased from the RTC under the AHDP, the RTC will require that not less than 15 percent
of the dwelling units in each separate multifamily property purchased in bulk be made available to low or very-low
income individuals. The final statement of policy was published on August 19, 1992 (57 FR 37581) and reflected no changes
from the interim statement of policy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 19, 1994, (59 FR 52669) the RTC published an interim Final Rule which implemented several statutory changes
made to the AHDP by the Refinancing Act and not reflected in the May 6, 1992 interim final rule, implemented a number
of statutory changes made to the AHDP by the enactment of the 1992 Appropriations Act, the 1992 Housing Act, and the
Completion Act, and, it further clarified RTC policies relating to the disposition of assets within the AHDP.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The RTC is making no changes to the interim final rule in the adoption of the final rule. The supplementary information
accompanying the interim final rule provides an explanation of 12 CFR part 1609 and the reasons for its adoption.

Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the following regulatory flexibility analysis is provided:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A succinct statement of the need for, and the objective of, the rule. The objective of the rule is to implement changes
made to the AHDP by enactment of the 1992 Appropriations Act, the Housing Act, and the Completion Act, which establishes
certain requirements for the RTC in the marketing and selling of real estate assets. The rule is needed in order to implement
the requirements of the cited statutes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A summary of the issues raised by public comments in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis, a
summary of the assessment by the agency of such issue, and a statement of any changes made in the interim final rule as
a result of such comments. The one public comment received by the RTC endorsed the regulations as drafted in the interim
final rule. No changes were made as a result of that comment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. A description of each of the significant alternatives to the rule consistent with the stated objectives of applicable
statutes and designed to minimize any significant economic impact of the rule on small entities which was considered
by the agency, and a statement of the reasons why each one of such alternatives was rejected. The rule has no significant
impact on small entities, and therefore, no alternatives to the rule were identified or considered.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to all Beech Model 400, 400A, 400T, and
MU&hyph;300&hyph;10 airplanes, and all Mitsubishi Model MU&hyph;300 airplanes. This action requires a revision
to the Airplane Flight Manual that provides pilots with special operating procedures during icing conditions. This
amendment is prompted by the results of icing tests, which demonstrated that ice accumulations on the horizontal
stabilizer may cause the airplane to pitch down at certain flaps settings. The actions specified in this AD are intended
to prevent uncommanded nose-down pitch at certain flap settings during icing conditions.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Recently, the FAA has received the results of icing tests conducted on the horizontal stabilizer of a Beech Model 400
airplane. These icing tests, conducted in an icing wind tunnel, demonstrated that, under certain icing conditions,
ice (called ``runback ice'') may accumulate on the horizontal stabilizer aft of the heated element on the leading
edge. This accumulated ice caused the test airplane to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pitch down at landing flaps set beyond 10 degrees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After further review and evaluation of the test data, Beech has developed landing performance data for Beech Model
MU&hyph;300&hyph;10 airplanes and Beech Model 400 series airplanes with flaps set at 10 degrees. These landing performance
data include landing distances, landing brake energy, and maximum landing weight. (The 10-degree landing flap performance
data for Mitsubishi Model MU&hyph;300 airplanes were included previously in that airplane's Airplane Flight Manual.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent to those icing tests, the FAA received a report of tailplane icing that occurred during a maintenance flight
of a Beech Model 400A airplane. The airplane's tail anti-ice/de-ice systems were turned on during this flight, which
was only 15 minutes in duration, and the airplane did not go above 4,000 feet elevation. During this flight, when the
flaps were extended beyond 20 degrees, the pilot noted some buffet and ``stick walking,'' a pitch control effect in
which uncommanded oscillation of the control column 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
caused the airplane to pitch. The pilot was able to land the airplane without incident with the flaps set at 10 degrees.
Subsequent investigation revealed that the horizontal stabilizer had accumulations of triangularly-shaped runback
ice formations, which were approximately 2 inches in height. These runback ice formations were similar in size and
shape to those used in the icing tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such runback ice formations could result in an uncommanded nose-down pitch at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flap settings that exceed 10 degrees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to the similarity in design of the horizontal stabilizers on Beech Model 400A airplanes and Mitsubishi Model MU&hyph;300
airplanes, and Beech Model 400, 400T, and MU&hyph;300&hyph;10 airplanes, the FAA has determined that all of these
airplanes may also be subject to the same unsafe condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other Beech Model 400, 400A, 400T,
and MU&hyph;300&hyph;10 airplanes and Mitsubishi Model MU&hyph;300 airplanes and of the same type design, this
AD is being issued to prevent uncommanded nose-down pitch at flap settings that exceed 10 degrees during icing conditions.
This AD requires a revision to the Limitations Section and Normal Procedures Section of the FAA-approved Airplane
Flight Manual (AFM), that provides pilots with special operating procedures during icing conditions. The landing
performance data developed as a result of the icing tests may be used under certain conditions for Beech Model MU&hyph;300&hyph;10
airplanes and Model 400 series airplanes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments Invited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under
the caption 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental, and energy aspects of the rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted
will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested
persons. A report that summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in
the Rules Docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted in response to this rule must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement
is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
94&hyph;NM&hyph;204&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be issued immediately to correct an unsafe condition in aircraft, and that it is not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has been determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emergency regulation otherwise would be significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules Docket.

 Section 2002(a) of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) required that the Secretary
of Transportation either designate six key areas as priority highway safety programs or submit a report to Congress
describing the reasons for not establishing these programs as priorities. Four of the six program areas had already
been designated as priority programs by the Secretary. This final rule adds Speed Control, but not School Bus Safety,
to the list of priority programs.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State and Community Highway Safety Grant Program (section 402 program) was established under the Highway Safety
Act of 1966, 23 U.S.C. 402. The Act required the establishment of Uniform Standards for State Highway Safety Programs
to assist the States and local communities in organizing their highway safety programs. Eighteen such standards
were established and have been administered at the Federal level by FHWA and NHTSA. NHTSA is responsible for developing
and implementing highway safety programs relating to the vehicle and driver; FHWA has similar responsibilities
in program areas involving the roadway. The FHWA is also responsible for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementing programs relating to commercial motor vehicle safety. These programs include measures related to
speed control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Until 1976, the 402 program was principally directed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
towards achieving State and local compliance with the 18 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Highway Safety Program Standards, which were considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandatory requirements with financial sanctions for non-compliance. Under the Highway Safety Act of 1976, Congress
provided for a more flexible implementation of the program so the Secretary would not have to require State compliance
with every uniform standard or with each element of every uniform standard. As a result, the standards became more
like guidelines for use by the States, and management of the program shifted from enforcing standards to one of problem
identification and countermeasure development and evaluation, using the standards as a framework for the State
programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1981, Congress passed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, Pub. L. 97&hyph;35, revising the section
402 program. The Act directed the agencies to conduct rulemaking to determine those State and local highway safety
programs most effective in reducing accidents, injuries, and fatalities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 1, 1982, NHTSA and FHWA issued a joint final rule (47 FR 15116) identifying six National Priority program areas
which the agencies then considered to be the most effective highway safety programs. The six program areas included
one FHWA program area, Safety Construction and Operational Improvements, and the following NHTSA Program Areas:
Occupant Protection, Alcohol Countermeasures, Police Traffic Services, Emergency Medical Services, and Traffic
Records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The April 1982 final rule provided that these National Priority program areas would be eligible for Federal funding
using an expedited procedure under the 402 program. 23 CFR 1205.4. It also established a mechanism by which other,
nonpriority programs identified by a State may be eligible for Federal funding. 23 CFR 1205.5(a) and (b).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 2, 1987, the enactment of the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987 (Public
Law 100&hyph;17) revised 23 U.S.C. 402. The changes provided for a periodic review of the effectiveness of the various
programs eligible for funding under section 402 in reducing crashes, injuries and fatalities. The periodic review
procedure was enacted to ensure the continued relevance of the section 402 program to changing circumstances and
traffic safety needs and to ensure that Federal funds continue to be used for the most effective programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The legislation also provided that the standards promulgated under section 402 and codified in 23 CFR Part 1204 be
changed to guidelines. The purpose of this amendment was to conform the language of section 402 and Part 1204 to the
current implementation of the programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to these amendments, NHTSA and FHWA conducted a rulemaking action to review those programs most effective
in reducing crashes, injuries and fatalities. In a final rule issued on April 6, 1988 (53 FR 1255), the agencies determined
that the National Priority program areas should continue to include the one FHWA program area, Roadway Safety (formerly,
Safety Construction and Operational Improvements), and the five NHTSA program areas that had been identified in
1982. In addition, the agencies determined that a sixth NHTSA area, Motorcycle Safety, should be added. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 3, 1991, NHTSA and FHWA published a joint NPRM (56 FR 20387) proposing to add Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety as
one of the National Priority program areas. The public comments supported that proposal and the area of Pedestrian
and Bicycle Safety was added to the list of National Priority program areas eligible for the expedited funding process
on October 4, 1991 (56 FR 50250). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of these rulemaking actions, the National Priority program areas included the following:

The Secretary had already designated four of these six program areas as priority programs, but not Speed Control or
School Bus Safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, on January 14, 1994, NHTSA and FHWA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 requesting comments from the public on whether to expand the list of National Priority program areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies explained that they apply three criteria to determine whether a program area should be identified as
a National Priority program under 23 CFR Part 1205: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Whether the problem is of national concern (including the relative magnitude of the problem); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Whether effective countermeasures have been developed in this area which address this concern; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Whether State programs in the area appear to be among the most effective in reducing crashes, injuries, and
fatalities as compared to other traffic safety program areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPRM proposed to expand the list of National Priority program areas to include Speed Control, and requested comments
on the agencies' preliminary determination that School Bus Safety should not be added as a National Priority program
area at this time.

Comments Received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies received 34 comments to the docket in response to the NPRM, including comments from 22 State agencies
(with responsibility for transportation/highway safety, law enforcement and education); a local PTA Council;
a county health department; a private bus operator; and nine national organizations. The national organizations
represent highway safety interests (National Association of Governors' Highway Safety Representatives, Insurance
Institute for Highway Safety, Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety and the Center for Auto Safety); law enforcement
organizations (International Association of Chiefs of Police and National Sheriffs' Association); and pupil transportation
interests (National Association for Pupil Transportation, National Association of State Directors of Pupil Transportation
Services and National School Transportation Association). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on our review of the comments received and other available information, NHTSA and FHWA have decided to adopt
the proposal published in the NPRM. For the reasons set forth below, the agencies have decided to add Speed Control
to the list of National Priority program areas, and not to add School Bus Safety to the list at this time.

Is Speeding a Problem of National Concern? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA and FHWA tentatively concluded in the NPRM that speeding is a problem of national concern, based on a number of
considerations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies explained in the NPRM that speeding is defined as not only exceeding the posted speed limit, but also driving
too fast for conditions. While the agencies recognized that reliable data on travel speeds are relatively limited
and often difficult to compare, NHTSA and FHWA tentatively concluded in the NPRM, based on the most reliable data available,
that the travel speeds of motorists have increased in recent years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPRM explained that NHTSA studies suggest that most drivers recognize that speeding is a violation of the law,
but few regard the violation as a serious offense. This led the agency to conclude that the public does not view speeding
per se as an immediate safety risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, as NHTSA and FHWA pointed out in the NPRM, speeding is one of the most prevalent reported factors associated
with crashes, and studies identify correlations between speeding and other factors often associated with crashes,
including alcohol involvement, young drivers, male drivers, motorcyclists and nighttime driving. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies reported in the NPRM that speeding is cited as a contributing factor in approximately 11 percent of all
police-reported crashes and in approximately 34 percent of all fatal crashes (NHTSA, Fatal Accident Reporting System,
1991). The agencies estimated that in 1991, 13,909 fatalities and 77,000 moderate to critical injuries occurred
in speed-related crashes, resulting in an economic cost for all speed-related crashes (including all injury levels)
of over $19 billion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As explained in the NPRM, excessive speed contributes to motor vehicle crashes in a number of ways. Drivers have less
time to react when travelling at higher speeds since speed increases the distance a vehicle travels during the time
it takes for a driver to react to a perceived danger; speed increases the total stopping distance necessary to halt
a vehicle; and speed reduces a driver's ability to steer safely around curves on highways or objects in the roadway.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Speed variance, the difference in speed among vehicles in the traffic stream, also contributes to motor vehicle crashes.
As speed variance increases, vehicles come close to each other more frequently, which leads to more frequent lane
changes and passing maneuvers as the faster drivers seek to avoid slower-moving vehicles. Research studies have
shown that motor vehicle crashes are more likely where speed variance is greater, and data have shown that a speed variance
of 20 mph from the average speed can result in a crash risk 11 times greater than those travelling at the average speed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, increased speeds result in reduced margins for error and increased severity for those vehicles involved
in crashes. As the speed of a car increases from 20 mph to 80 mph, a factor of four, the energy of the impact delivered in
a collision with a fixed object goes up by a factor of sixteen, increasing dramatically the chance of death or serious
injury. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Citing a recent FHWA study entitled Assessment of Current Speed Zoning Criteria, the NPRM indicated that: (1) On average,
seven out of ten motorists exceeded posted limits; (2) average speeds ran approximately two to six mph above posted
limits; and (3) prevailing 85th percentile speeds ran approximately eight to twelve mph above posted limits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter, the West Virginia Division of Highways, questioned the agencies' tentative conclusion that speeding
is a problem of national concern. The State asserted that the agencies' comparison between the 85th percentile speed
and the speed limit indicates a problem with speed zones (which, according to West Virginia, are set through public
pressure rather than by engineering principles), not with speeding. West Virginia further suggested that, as drivers
have gained additional experience driving faster than 55 (following the speed limit's being raised to 65 on certain
rural Interstates), ``it is to be anticipated that speeds would gradually increase.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies accept West Virginia's explanation that, as drivers gain additional experience driving faster, their
speeds tend to increase. We disagree, however, that this supports a conclusion that the difference between the 85th
percentile speed and the speed limit indicates a problem with speed zones, not with speeding. In fact, if West Virginia's
explanation is correct, the agencies believe that, if speed limits were increased to match the 85th percentile, speeds
are likely to gradually increase even further, as drivers adjust to the higher speed limits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All other comments received in response to the NPRM supported the agencies' conclusion that speeding is a problem
of national concern. New Mexico, for example, reported that it continues to suffer among the highest rates of motor
vehicle deaths in the nation, and some 25% of their crash fatalities involve excessive speed. Michigan reported that
in 1991 excessive speed accounted for 43% of the total crashes, 44% of fatal crashes, 52% of injury crashes and 41% of
property damage crashes in that State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alaska commented that traveling at unsafe speeds is the leading cause of the State's motor vehicle crashes and is a
contributing factor in 27% of its fatal crashes. North Carolina stated that in 1992 speed was noted as a contributing
factor in 32% of all crashes and 39.8% of fatal crashes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) provided data supporting the agencies' conclusion that travel
speeds are increasing. In addition, IIHS stated that fatalities have increased along with travel speeds. According
to IIHS:

In the 40 States that increased their speed limits to 65 mph on rural interstates during 1987 and 1988, deaths on these
roads were 17 percent higher in 1992, compared with the average number of deaths on the same roads during 1982&hyph;86.
In contrast, deaths on rural interstates where the 55 mph limit was retained were 28 percent lower in 1992 compared
with 1982&hyph;86. In the 40 States that raised their rural interstate speed limit, the urban interstate limit speed
remained unchanged and on those highways, deaths in 1992 were 8 percent lower than in 1982&hyph;86 (IIHS, 1993b).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Have Effective Speed Control Countermeasures Been Developed? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies identified, in the NPRM, a number of speed control countermeasures that they consider to be effective.
They indicated that NHTSA has identified and evaluated, and is currently demonstrating in the law enforcement community
a number of new law enforcement technologies to further advance speed control efforts, including radar, VASCAR,
laser speed measuring devices, aerial speed measurement, photo radar and electronic signing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPRM stated that NHTSA studies show that one of the best methods for obtaining compliance with speed limits is to
combine an aggressive enforcement campaign with a vigorous public information and education effort. It also cited
other effective countermeasures, such as saturation patrols and multi-agency, multi-jurisdictional enforcement
efforts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the areas of highway design and traffic control, the agencies explained that freeway design, culminating in the
Interstate System, has eliminated at-grade intersections and provided for free flow traffic, which has resulted
in a significant reduction in speed variance and the promotion of uniform operating speed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other effective countermeasures were also mentioned. For example, the NPRM indicated that variable message speed
signs have been developed to control speed for varying conditions and that real time regulatory variable speed limits
are now being tested in the State of Washington. The NPRM indicated that these efforts can be further enhanced through
the development of comprehensive speed control programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters cited many of the same countermeasures and technologies in their responses to the NPRM, and indicated
they considered them to be effective. IIHS, for example, indicated it believes VASCAR and laser technologies can
be effective at increasing the proportion of speeders cited for violations since they are not detectable by radar
detectors. IIHS recommended also the use of radar detector detectors (RDDs) as an effective countermeasure for identifying
individuals who are likely to be ``professional speeders.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No commenters suggested that no effective speed control countermeasures have been developed, and the agencies continue
to conclude that effective countermeasures have been developed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Do State Speed Control Programs Appear To Be Among the Most Effective in Reducing Crashes, Injuries, and Fatalities?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA and FHWA stated in the NPRM that state programs that have been conducted to date demonstrate that speed control
countermeasures are extremely effective in reducing deaths and injuries, and cited a number of examples. (For details,
interested persons should read the NPRM.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The California Office of Traffic Safety (OTS) interpreted this statement to mean that the agencies were placing more
importance on State, rather than local, programs. NHTSA and FHWA did not intend to give this impression. In fact, the
agencies recognize that many countermeasures in the Speed Control area can be carried out most effectively at the
local level. The agencies' reference to ``State programs'' was intended to cover programs conducted at either the
State or local level within a State. California OTS went on to indicate that many countermeasures have been employed
successfully throughout the State to address the speeding problem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of California Highway Patrol (CHP) stated that effective countermeasures exist only for localized
speed control. CHP claimed that the success of these programs is almost always localized and/or temporary. The agencies
agree that localized enforcement efforts alone generally result in only localized, short-term impacts. However,
it has long been established that enforcement efforts, when combined with a vigorous public information and education
campaign, have much more long-lasting effects. (See, ``Evaluation of the New York State Police 55 MPH Speed Enforcement
Project,'' August 1969, by the Institute for Traffic Safety Management and Research.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters, such as IIHS and Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, supported this view. Advocates further commented,
``A national effort [which provides a greater level of public information and awareness regarding the safety dangers
associated with speeding] will establish the safety context for state and local speed control efforts under the 402
Program and provide those efforts with added credibility.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
West Virginia questioned the validity of the examples cited in the NPRM. The State argued that ``the reductions in
speed [experienced in South Carolina and St. Louis] were minuscule'' and ``the sample [used in California] was very
small.'' West Virginia continued, ``the Notice states a belief that the programs were effective but it gives no measures
of statistical significance or indications of necessary seasonal adjustments or other information to back up this
conclusion.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies disagree with West Virginia's comments. The success of the South Carolina study, for example, was not
measured by reductions in speed, but rather using other factors. As stated in the NPRM, there were 12,472 fewer crashes
(a 10% decrease), 2,331 fewer injuries (a 7% decrease) and 106 fewer fatalities in 1991 in South Carolina as compared
to 1989 (an 11% decrease). The vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in South Carolina increased from 32,780 million to 34,456
million (a 5% increase) during this period of time. The agencies believe the State's rural initiative contributed
to these reductions and that these reductions are significant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies agree that the reduction in average speed (from 62 mph to 61 mph) experienced in the first year of the St.
Louis enforcement operation (Operation Gateway) was not a significant reduction. However, the NPRM stated that
the St. Louis program was continuing and was expected to result in further speed decreases, and further results have
in fact been achieved. The Missouri Division of Highway Safety did not report the reduction in average speed as part
of the second phase of Operation Gateway. The State did report, however, that, prior to the kickoff of the operation,
the average speed of vehicles stopped for speeding on I&hyph;270 was 78.3 mph, and the average speed of vehicles stopped
during the Operation Gateway kickoff was 74.3 mph. This represents a 5% reduction in speed. The agencies believe this
reduction is significant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the California study, the sample used may have appeared small, as compared with the general motor vehicle
population, but the study's focus was on commercial motor vehicles, and the study used as its sample a census of all
crashes where the commercial motor vehicle was at fault. As the agencies explained in the NPRM, speed control efforts
targeted commercial motor vehicles, and the data revealed that the number of crashes where commercial motor vehicles
were at fault decreased by 3.5% (from 810 in 1986 to 782 in 1987). The number of crashes caused by commercial motor vehicles
which resulted in injuries also declined, by 11.2% (from 259 in 1986 to 230 in 1987).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Seasonal adjustments were not made for the studies referenced in the NPRM because they were not considered to be necessary.
Seasonal adjustments are not considered to be necessary, for example, for studies in which data is to be collected
during a brief period of time involving no seasonal changes or for studies in which data is to be collected during comparable
time periods. Data was collected for the South Carolina study during the same four months in 1990 and 1991. Data was
collected for the St. Louis effort during a brief period of time before and during the kickoff of Operation Gateway,
so seasonal changes were not a factor in that study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most of the commenters agreed with the conclusion in the NPRM that Speed Control Programs appear to be among the most
effective in reducing crashes, injuries, and fatalities, and they provided examples demonstrating the effectiveness
of speed control countermeasures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IIHS indicated that, in South Carolina, police issued 41 tickets per 1,000 vehicles using lasers, as compared with
33 per 1,000 using conventional radar. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New York State reported that it experienced the lowest fatality rate on record in 1992 (1.65 deaths per hundred million
vehicle miles traveled), ``due in large part to the Division's strict [comprehensive speed] enforcement program.''
According to New York, the fatality rate of 1.65 was 29 percent lower than 2.33 in 1987 (when the State started its program)
and equates to 520 fewer lives lost on the highways of that State. The program included a saturation strategy that not
only led to the apprehension of specific motorists, but also established a visible presence and generated publicity
which raised the perception of risk among all motorists within the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on available information and the comments received in response to the NPRM, the agencies continue to conclude
that Speed Control Programs are among the most effective in reducing crashes, injuries, and fatalities.

Other Comments Received About Speed Control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State of Illinois agreed that Speed Control should be designated a priority program, but commented that there
should be no earmarking of funds for Speed Control (or any other program) and monetary sanctions should not be imposed
on States for failing to meet compliance levels. Congress enacted the National Maximum Speed Limit law, which established
monetary sanctions for noncompliance and has, from time to time, imposed earmarking or set-aside requirements in
appropriations legislation. NHTSA and FHWA are bound to implement these congressional requirements. However,
the designation of Speed Control as a priority program under section 402 in this final rule will not create any additional
earmarking requirements or monetary sanctions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most comments strongly supported the designation of Speed Control as a National Priority program area, particularly
at this time. New Mexico, for example, expressed its view that:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Speeding and excessive highway speeds have reached epidemic proportions and must be treated as a national public
health problem. *&blank;*&blank;* It is incumbent on the agencies to develop a high profile national program against
speeding that provides a greater level of public information and awareness regarding the safety dangers associated
with speeding.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NAGHSR concurred with the designation of Speed Control as a National Priority, but expressed concern about the ``proliferation
of 402 priorities'' and the ``possible overlap and duplication'' between the Speed Control and Police Traffic Services
(PTS) programs. NAGHSR suggested that the agencies consider instead combining these two programs in a way that emphasizes
the importance of speed compliance activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three other commenters also recommended that Speed Control be included under PTS, but for different reasons. California
OTS expressed concern that a separate Speed Control program area could ``result in the redirection of efforts into
`speed only' projects and dilute the accomplishments made in highlighting speed as a major problem in all traffic
safety ventures.'' CHP stated that Speed Control already receives considerable attention, and argued that including
Speed Control under PTS would allow individual States to better balance their overall approach to traffic safety.
West Virginia expressed its opinion that ``public acceptance is likely to be higher if the Speed Control function
is part of a well-reasoned and balanced enforcement program rather than as a stand-alone effort which can be interpreted
as a revenue enhancement measure.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies agree with the commenters that Speed Control programs should continue to be included as part of broader
traffic safety programs. However, the designation of Speed Control as a priority program does not require that States
establish ``stand-alone'' efforts. States have the ability and, in fact, are encouraged by the agencies to continue
to include Speed Control messages in their other traffic safety programs. It is the agencies' hope that the program's
designation as a National Priority program area will result in the inclusion of Speed Control messages in more traffic
safety programs than before. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA and FHWA have considered the comments cited above, and decided not to include Speed Control as part of PTS. The
agencies recognize that there will be some overlap between the areas of Speed Control and PTS, since law enforcement
activity is an important component in any Speed Control program. (There is a similar level of overlap between the areas
of PTS and other priority programs, such as Alcohol Countermeasures and Occupant Protection, to the extent that police
agencies enforce laws designed to address these issues.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the agencies believe it is important to list the Speed Control program (as well as Alcohol Countermeasures
and Occupant Protection) separately, to reflect non-law enforcement activities that are equally important components
of these programs. In the area of Speed Control, these components include, for example, the development and enactment
of speed-related laws, the use of new technologies, public information and education activities, and the reexamination
of speed zoning criteria to ensure that posted speed limits are appropriate for conditions.

Speed Control Determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies conclude that speeding does represent a significant traffic safety problem throughout the country,
and that numerous countermeasures have been developed that have proven to be most effective in addressing this problem.
Accordingly, NHTSA and FHWA have decided to designate Speed Control as a separate National Priority program area.
Speed Control will be administered jointly by both agencies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Is School Bus Safety a Problem of National Concern? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA and FHWA explained in the NPRM that the safety of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
children in school buses has been a primary concern of parents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and school systems ever since buses began to be used to transport children and that this concern has helped develop
school buses into the safest form of transportation in the country. The NPRM reported that, according to the National
Safety Council's ``Accident Facts'' (1991), during the 1989&hyph;90 school year, an estimated 380,000 buses were
used to transport 22 million pupils approximately 3.8 billion miles (21 million miles per school day) and that occupant
fatality rates per hundred million passenger miles in 1989 were 1.12 for passenger cars and 0.04 for school buses.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies recognized in the NPRM that school bus crashes, as compared with automobile crashes, have a much different
effect on the population as a whole. When a child is fatally injured in a school bus crash, there is a greater sense of
loss and a greater sense of tragedy. For this reason, school bus fatalities and crashes often receive a high degree
of public attention and draw an immediate and passionate response from the community.

However, the number of fatalities in school bus crashes is small, particularly when considering exposure and when
compared to the number of fatalities related to other priority programs. In 1991, passenger cars were involved in
86.4 percent of all traffic crashes and 67.9 percent of all fatal crashes; whereas school buses were involved in only
0.4 percent of all traffic crashes and in 0.3 percent of all fatal crashes. These data demonstrate that the safety problem
related to school buses is not great when compared to that of other types of vehicles.

Based on these findings, NHTSA and FHWA tentatively concluded in the NPRM that School Bus Safety is not a problem that
merits designation as a National Priority program area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters argued that any number of school bus fatalities above zero is too high a fatality rate and, therefore,
justifies designating School Bus Safety as a Priority program. According to the California Department of Education,
``school bus safety must be a priority issue for both the State and Federal Government for as long as our accident statistics
show one `1' pupil passenger or one `1' pupil pedestrian fatality. Zero `0', tolerance of pupil passenger and pedestrian
fatalities must be our goal.'' Similarly, the Center for Auto Safety argued that ``the only way DOT could reject school
bus safety as a Priority Program would be to find that such a designation would not reduce injuries and deaths in school
buses at all.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies disagree, and while other commenters sought to have the agencies designate School Bus Safety as a priority
program area, they did not suggest that School Bus Safety represents a significant national problem. In fact, the
Superintendent of Public Instruction for Washington State said, ``We cannot disagree with [the statistics] you
have published [and w]e can not provide any additional statistics that disagree with what you have already stated
regarding Pupil Transportation as the safest means of travel in the highway safety system.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most commenters fully agreed with the agencies' conclusion that School Bus Safety does not represent a serious problem
when compared to safety in other types of vehicles. The Oregon Department of Transportation, for example, stated
``Oregon has had one serious school bus accident in the last seventeen years. And, even though safety of our children
is a major concern, I do not believe school busses should be a NHTSA priority. *&blank;*&blank;* School busses are
probably the safest place for students to be. We do not need to concentrate extraordinary effort on school bus safety.''
The North Carolina Department of Transportation commented, ``In North Carolina, as in the rest of the nation, school
buses remain the safest mode of transportation. *&blank;*&blank;* While the safety of our children is still paramount,
it will be extremely difficult for any further school bus safety initiatives to be cost effective.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New Mexico provided data which supported the agencies' conclusion. The State's comments indicated, ``95 percent
of school children in serious crashes during school hours were in conventional passenger vehicles_passenger cars,
pickups, and vans.'' Only one percent of New Mexico's school children in serious crashes during school hours were
in buses. The remaining 4 percent were pedestrians, on motorcycles, on pedalcycles, and others, at one percent each.
New Mexico's comments continued, ``It is fair to say that non-use of safety belts in private vehicles is the largest
part of New Mexico's schoolchild safety problem. *&blank;*&blank;* Indeed, the only deaths involving school buses
in the past decade have occurred outside the bus, or while entering or leaving.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the comments received and the information available to the agencies, NHTSA and FHWA continue to find that
School Bus Safety does not represent a serious problem that warrants its designation as a National Priority program
area.

Have Effective School Bus Safety Measures Been Developed? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA and FHWA explained in the NPRM that, although statistics demonstrate that school buses already provide a remarkably
safe form of transportation, steps have been taken to further improve School Bus Safety. These steps included providing
set-aside funds in 1990 and 1991 to assist States in implementing ``effective'' and ``most effective'' school bus
safety measures and publishing a number of rulemaking actions, such as a final rule requiring new school buses to be
equipped with a stop signal arm, a final rule revising the minimum requirements for school bus emergency exits and
improving access to school bus emergency doors and a final rule requiring that school buses enable drivers to see either
directly or through mirrors certain specified areas in front of and along both sides of the vehicle. For a full discussion
of these and other actions, interested individuals are encouraged to read the NPRM (59 FR 2341&hyph;42). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA has taken a number of additional steps that were not listed in the NPRM to improve School Bus Safety. For example,
to improve the lateral stability and control of medium and heavy vehicles (including school buses) during braking,
NHTSA issued an NPRM proposing to require that these vehicles be equipped with an antilock brake system (58 F.R. 50738).
NHTSA also published a School Bus Safety Report and an annual publication entitled ``Traffic Safety Facts 1993_School
Buses.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the National Safety Council (NSC) has agreed to undertake a comprehensive marketing campaign on a school
bus/pedestrian safety educational program, developed recently by NHTSA for children in grades K&hyph;6. This program
is currently being modified into a product that will be more marketable. NSC anticipates reaching over seven million
people in its initial marketing effort. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA has also taken steps to improve communications with the Pupil Transportation community. The Department issued
a press release concerning school bus safety in August 1994, just prior to the beginning of the new school year and,
on August 18, 1994, NHTSA conducted a National Meeting on Transporting Pre-Kindergarten Children on School Buses.
The meeting brought together, for the first time, school bus manufacturers, child safety seat manufacturers, pupil
transportation officials, child safety seat trainers, injury control professionals and Federal officials to discuss
this emerging transportation issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA and FHWA will continue to engage in appropriate activities that improve the safety of school buses.

Do State School Bus Safety Measures Appear To Be Among the Most Effective in Reducing Crashes, Injuries, and Fatalities?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated previously, school buses already provide the safest form of transportation in our country. Since the number
of fatalities that are school bus-related is already so small, it is difficult to quantify the benefits of the actions
that have been taken. The agencies believe, however, that these actions (described above), are the ones most likely
to reduce or eliminate fatal and serious injuries.

Fourteen commenters supported the agencies' tentative conclusion not to designate School Bus Safety as a National
Priority program area. These commenters included three national highway safety organizations, ten State highway
safety/transportation agencies and one State highway patrol. Twelve commenters urged the agencies to reconsider
their tentative conclusion. These commenters included one national highway safety organization, one national
police organization, three national pupil transportation organizations, five State departments of education,
one local PTA council and one private bus operator.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters supported the designation of School Bus Safety as a National Priority program area based on specific
safety concerns they face. Three commenters, for example, expressed concern over recent increases in the number
of incidents involving misbehavior and violence on school buses, and one commenter expressed concern about crashes
involving buses and heavy trucks. While these problems may be of concern in particular communities, the comments
did not reveal and our data do not indicate that these are problems of great magnitude throughout the nation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The section 402 program provides States with a mechanism for funding programs that address State or local concerns,
by providing justification that includes information on the identified problem and the activities or projects that
are planned. Accordingly, these States and communities have the ability, if they so choose and can provide the justification,
to develop programs to address the problems identified in their comments. Moreover, the existence of these local
problems does not support a decision to designate School Bus Safety as a National Priority program area for the entire
nation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters supported the agencies' view. The Massachusetts Governor's Highway Safety Bureau, for example,
stated, ``School bus safety deserves a place within the 402 program, however each state should identify the need for
funding, within the framework of the existing 402 guidelines.'' The Michigan Department of State Police commented,
``[school bus safety] is an important element of any state's highway safety program but should be based upon the identified
need in a particular state.'' The Arizona Governor's Office of Highway Safety reported that it was able to support
a school bus driver/instructor training and certification program using section 402 dollars using the current funding
procedures. Arizona commented, ``There was no program priority for school bus safety at that time, and we were still
able to address the issue by utilizing the current U.S. Department of Transportation 402 program management procedures
already in place.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments of the National Association of Governors' Highway Safety Representatives (NAGHSR) were most comprehensive,
and represented the views expressed by many of the other commenters. NAGHSR stated: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
We *&blank;*&blank;* concur that school bus safety should not be designated a National Program Priority. NAGHSR
is very supportive of the need for protecting the safety of school children. However, state crash statistics indicate
that the problem is not of sufficient magnitude to warrant a priority designation. Furthermore, we are concerned
that the designation of school bus safety will divert scarce 402 resources away from critical highway safety areas
such as impaired driving, occupant protection, and speed control. States currently have the flexibility to spend
402 funds on school bus safety if the needs exist and can be documented. This flexibility is sufficient to address whatever
school bus safety needs may exist. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters that urged the agencies to designate School Bus Safety as a National Priority program area did so not
based on a perceived current safety problem or concern, but rather based on a need for continued funding to maintain
their positive safety record. As explained previously, however, this is not a valid criterion for designating a program
to be a National Priority area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies are not attempting, as suggested by the National School Transportation Association, to ``[p]enaliz[e]
the industry for doing a good job.'' In fact, we applaud the industry for its dedication and continued excellent record
of service and safety. Rather, we are simply making our best efforts to ensure that scarce 402 resources are used where
they can have the greatest positive effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most of the commenters agreed with this approach. The North Carolina Department of Transportation, for example,
stated, ``By not including school bus safety as a priority program NHTSA and FHWA will allow limited resources to be
utilized where they can be most effective.'' New Mexico commented that it supports the agencies' decision to ``leav[e]
school bus safety in its current status as an important area of state efforts to protect children, but without elevating
it to a higher status as a national priority program area.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies understand the concern of many of the commenters who are fearful that funds currently available may be
discontinued. The agencies do not intend for the decision not to include School Bus Safety as a National Priority program
to create an implication that resources currently devoted to School Bus Safety should be reduced or redirected.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commenters noted that many more school children die or are injured as pedestrians or bicyclists than as
school bus occupants. The National School Transportation Association stated, ``Outside the bus, in the loading/unloading
zone area, has been and is still the problem area.'' According to NHTSA's ``Traffic Safety Facts 1993_School Buses,''
of the people who lost their lives in school bus-related crashes from 1983 through 1993, 59 percent were occupants
of other vehicles involved in the crash, 30 percent were non-occupants (pedestrians, bicyclists, etc.) and only
11 percent were occupants of school buses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some of these commenters were hopeful that problems related to the loading and unloading of school children can be
addressed through the Pedestrian Safety program area, which was designated a National Priority area in 1991. Within
this context, some commenters requested additional emphasis and attention from the agencies with regard to pedestrian
safety issues, and the Superintendent of Public Instruction in Washington State cautioned that ``the emphasis of
[pedestrian safety programs] usually has little to do with school bus stops.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA has already taken steps to address this concern, which is shared by the agencies. In September 1992, NHTSA started
a research and development effort relating to elementary school-age pedestrians who are school bus riders. Under
this effort, which was completed in the spring of 1994, the agency reviewed existing training materials and national
crash data relating to school bus pedestrian safety for elementary school-age children; developed a school bus/pedestrian
safety educational program for children in grades K&hyph;6, which includes teacher's guides, a poster and a video
for grades K&hyph;3, videos and brochures for parents and bus drivers, and promotional materials; selected a school
district to assess the program's effectiveness in reducing crash-related behaviors; implemented and evaluated
the program in that district and modified the program, as warranted. A report regarding this effort is expected to
be published in the spring of 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated earlier, the National Safety Council (NSC) has agreed to undertake a comprehensive marketing campaign
on the school bus/pedestrian safety educational program. This program is currently being modified into a product
that will be more marketable. NSC anticipates reaching over seven million people in its initial marketing effort.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Center for Auto Safety (CAS) objected to the agencies' decision by arguing that Congress ``mandated'' in ISTEA
that School Bus Safety must be a priority program. CAS asserted that, since Congress was aware when it enacted ISTEA
that there were lower fatality rates for school buses, ``The only way for DOT to overturn the Congressional mandate
in ISTEA that school bus safety shall be a Priority Program is for DOT to find that a Priority Program cannot reduce deaths
and injuries in school bus accidents.'' According to CAS, ``DOT cannot substitute its judgment for that of Congress
which has determined that saving even a few lives from school bus accidents is as important a priority as saving thousands
of lives lost due to excess speeds.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies strongly disagree with CAS' comments. We have no reason to believe, and CAS cites no basis for its assertions,
that Congress mandated that School Bus Safety must be designated a priority program if the program has the potential
to save just a single life or that Congress believes that the thousands of lives lost due to excess speeds (many of whom
are children) are somehow less important than the few children whose lives are lost in school buses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In fact, the legislative history shows quite the contrary. The House version of ISTEA identified eight required and
seven optional highway safety programs. Speeding was identified in the House legislation as a required program;
school bus safety was identified as an optional program. (The Senate version of ISTEA had no comparable provision.)
The final ISTEA legislation, which was developed in conference, listed just six program areas and eliminated the
separate categories. However, it specifically provided the agencies with the option of choosing not to designate
one or more of these six programs as National Priorities by reporting to Congress the reasons for not establishing
the programs as priority areas. (CAS acknowledged this option in its comments.) Moreover, there is no suggestion
anywhere in the legislative history that School Bus Safety (or any of the highway safety programs, for that matter)
should meet criteria other than those normally applied by the agencies when they determine what programs should be
designated as National Priority areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CAS also questioned the agencies' reliance on data from FARS, ``Accident Facts'' and the National Safety Council.
CAS argued that the agencies should not rely on these data because they under-report school crashes, deaths and injuries.
Another commenter, Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, also pointed out that school bus crashes, injuries and
fatalities may be under-reported, and suggested that the agencies investigate this issue. This commenter, however,
fully supported the agencies' preliminary conclusions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies acknowledge that there may be some under-reporting of school bus crashes, deaths and injuries, and we
are taking steps to improve these data. Currently, pursuant to section 2002(a) of ISTEA, the Department is in the process
of developing minimum reporting criteria for States regarding deaths and injuries resulting from school bus crashes,
as well as deaths and injuries involving other circumstances. While it may be possible to improve the data, it is clear
from the data currently available (including those contained in comments received in response to the NPRM) that the
numbers of school bus crashes, injuries and fatalities are extremely low.

School Bus Safety Determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The safety of children in school buses is an important concern, since any crash, particularly one resulting in fatalities
or serious injury to children, is so tragic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the number of crashes, injuries and fatalities involving school buses is small, particularly when considering
exposure and when compared to the number of crashes, injuries and fatalities related to other priority programs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies believe significant attention has been devoted to School Bus Safety and steps have been taken to improve
the already excellent safety record of this mode of transportation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the states already have the ability under the Section 402 program to address school bus and other highway
safety programs, and are proficient in allocating existing resources as they deem necessary to achieve maximum safety
benefits. In addition, the States are able to address the majority of school bus-related fatalities, which occur
while children are boarding or exiting, not riding the bus, under the Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety program, which
is a designated National Priority area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, and based on a review of the comments and other information currently available, the agencies conclude
that there is not sufficient justification for designating School Bus Safety as a National Priority program area.

Therefore, the agencies have not included School Bus Safety as a National Priority program at this time. The agencies
wish to stress that this decision should not be construed to imply that the current resources focused upon School Bus
Safety should be reduced or redirected. NHTSA and FHWA believe that all existing efforts in this area should be continued
to maintain the impressive safety record associated with school bus transportation.

Other Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter, a local health department in Reno, Nevada, urged the agencies to reinstate Emergency Medical Services
(EMS) as a priority program under section 402. As mentioned earlier in this notice, EMS was designated as a priority
program on April 1, 1982. It has not been removed from the list of priorities. In fact, every program that has been designated
by the agencies as a priority program remains on the list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As explained above, ISTEA required that the Secretary of Transportation either designate six program areas as priority
highway safety programs or submit a report to Congress describing the reasons for not establishing these programs
as priorities. Four of the programs that NHTSA and FHWA had previously designated as priority areas (Traffic Records,
Emergency Medical Services, Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety and Roadway Safety) were not listed in ISTEA. ISTEA continued
to provide the agencies with authority, however, to include additional programs or maintain existing programs on
the list of priority areas. Accordingly, these four programs continue to be included on the list of National Priority
program areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The National Sheriffs' Association recommended that the following be considered priority programs: (1) Speed Control;
(2) Occupant Protection/Child Safety Protection; (3) DWI/DUI Detection and Standardized Field Sobriety Programs
for law enforcement officers/deputies; (4) Conspicuity Markings at Railway/Railroad/Mass Transit Crossings
and (5) Drug Evaluation, Classification, Drug Recognition Expert (DRE), and the Drug Recognition Technician (DRT)
Programs for law enforcement officers/deputies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As explained above, this final rule designates Speed Control as a National Priority program area. Occupant Protection
has been a National Priority area since 1982. It includes activities designed to protect occupants who are children.
Alcohol and Other Drug Countermeasures has also been a National Priority since 1982. States and communities may conduct
DWI/DUI Detection, Standardized Field Sobriety, Drug Evaluation and Classification (DEC), Drug Recognition Expert
(DRE), and Drug Recognition Technician (DRT) Programs for law enforcement officers/deputies under this program
area. The agencies do not see a need to emphasize these programs as separate priorities. Finally, States and communities
can conduct certain activities to improve the conspicuity of markings at railway, railroad and mass transit crossings
under Roadway Safety, a FHWA National Priority program. In addition, there are other sources of Federal assistance
available from FHWA to improve safety in this area. FHWA does not believe there is reason to designate these activities
as a separate priority program.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM is approving, with an exception, a proposed amendment to the Indiana permanent regulatory program (hereinafter
referred to as the Indiana program) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The program
amendment consists of revisions to Indiana's Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Rules concerning performance
standards for restoring soil productivity for surface coal mining and reclamation operations under IC 13&hyph;4.1.
The amendment is intended to revise the Indiana program to be consistent with SMCRA and the corresponding Federal
regulations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On July 29, 1982, the Indiana program was made effective by the conditional approval of the Secretary of the Interior.
Information pertinent to the general background on the Indiana program, including the Secretary's findings, the
disposition of comments, and a detailed explanation of the conditions of approval of the Indiana program can be found
in the July 26, 1982

II. Submission of the Amendment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated January 4, 1993 (Administrative Record Number IND&hyph;1193), Indiana submitted a proposed amendment
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
93&hyph;1) intended to address the required program amendments concerning revegetation at 30 CFR 914.16 (i), (j),
(k), (l), and (m). See 57 FR 41869 (September 14, 1992), and 57 FR 22653 (May 29, 1992) for background on these required
amendments. The amendments submitted on January 4, 1993, were reviewed and approved by the Director on August 2, 1993
(58 FR 41039).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated August 11, 1994 (Administrative Record Number IND&hyph;1392), Indiana submitted formal program
amendment 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
94&hyph;3. The proposed program amendment concerns the performance standards for restoring soil productivity
for surface coal mining and reclamation operations under IC 13&hyph;4.1. In its submittal of this amendment, Indiana
stated that all of the rules, except 310 IAC 12&hyph;4&hyph;16, were submitted in a previous package (amendment 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
93&hyph;1) and approved by OSM August 2, 1993. In addition, 310 IAC 12&hyph;5&hyph;145(c), which was approved as
part of amendment 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
93&hyph;1 has been deleted and does not appear in this submittal. Indiana stated that as a result of ongoing Federal
litigation over the language of the previously-submitted subsection (c) of 310 IAC 12&hyph;5&hyph;145, IAC 12&hyph;5&hyph;145(c)
will not be resubmitted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subsection 16(c)(3)(A) is amended by deleting the word ``or'' and replacing that word with ``and.'' As amended, subsection
16(c)(3)(A) provides that Phase III bond may be released only after: (A) the operator has successfully completed
all surface coal mining and reclamation activities required in IC 13&hyph;4.1, 310 IAC 12, ``and'' the permit. The
Director finds this change to be no less stringent than SMCRA at sections 509(a) and 519(c)(3), and no less effective
than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.40(c)(3).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Indiana has deleted subsection 145(c) which was approved by OSM on August 2, 1993 (58 FR 41039). Deleted subsection
145(c) contained the following language: ``Soil reconstruction shall be carried out in accordance with the specifications
of the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) of the United States Department of Agriculture establishing prime farmland
soil reconstruction specifications for Indiana.'' In its submittal of this amendment Indiana tated that the language
quoted above was omitted because of ongoing litigation concerning the language of subsection 145(c). The litigation
which Indiana referred to above is

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 823.4(b) provide that the regulatory authority within each State shall use the soil-reconstruction
specifications established by the SCS to carry out the State's responsibilities concerning prime farmland. Prior
to the #93&hyph;1 program amendment Indiana had no counterpart to the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 823.4(b). Indiana
added a counterpart to 30 CFR 823.4(b) at 310 IAC 12&hyph;5&hyph;145(c) in amendment #93&hyph;1, and OSM approved
the addition. In the #94&hyph;3 amendment, Indiana has removed the counterpart to 30 CFR 823.4(b), due to the lawsuit
cited above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The lawsuit cited above involves the following. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia has held that
the SCS's specifications for prime farmland soil reconstruction must be promulgated as ``rules'' under the Federal
Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. 551 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

, and must be subject to public comment prior to becoming effective.

, No. 79&hyph;1144 (D.D.C. October 1, 1984), slip. Op. pp. 23&hyph;24. The Indiana Coal Council, Inc. (ICC) contends
that an Indiana counterpart to 30 CFR 823.4(b) should not be approved by OSM until after the SCS has complied with the
requirement to subject its ``specifications'' to public comment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM had required that Indiana promulgate a regulation addressing the requirements of 30 CFR 823.4(b). (57 FR 41873,
September 14, 1992). When Indiana proposed 310 IAC 12&hyph;5&hyph;145(c) as the counterpart to 30 CFR 823.4(b),
OSM removed the required amendment at 30 CFR 914.16(l). (58 FR 41042, August 2, 1993.) Since Indiana has now deleted
310 IAC 12&hyph;5&hyph;145(c), the State's program again lacks a counterpart to 30 CFR 823.4(b). Therefore, the
Director finds that the deletion of 310 IAC 12&hyph;5&hyph;145(c) renders the Indiana program less effective than
the Federal regulations. Consequently, the Director is requiring that Indiana amend its program to include a counterpart
to 30 CFR 823.4(b) or to otherwise require that any prime farmland soil reconstruction specifications promulgated
as rules for the State of Indiana by the SCS be incorporated by reference into the Indiana program.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 47574). The comment period closed on October 17, 1994. No one commented and no one requested an opportunity to

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), the Director is required to obtain the written concurrence of the Administrator
of the EPA with respect to any provisions of a State program amendment that relate to air or water quality standards
promulgated under the authority of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) or the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.). The Director has determined that this amendment contains no provisions in these categories and that EPA's concurrence
is not required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 732.17(h)(11)(i), OSM solicited comments on the proposed amendment from EPA. EPA responded by letter
dated September 27, 1994 (Administrative Record Number IND&hyph;1402). In that letter, the EPA stated that it had
no comments on the proposed amendment.

V. Director's Decision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the findings above, the Director is approving, except as noted herein, Indiana's program amendment concerning
performance standards for restoring soil productivity submitted by Indiana on August 11, 1994. As discussed in Finding
2, the Director has determined that the deletion of 310 IAC 12&hyph;5&hyph;145(c) renders the Indiana program less
effective than the Federal regulations. The Director is requiring that Indiana amend its program to include a counterpart
to 30 CFR 823.4(b) or to otherwise require that any prime farmland soil reconstruction specifications promulgated
as rules for the State of Indiana by the SCS be incorporated by reference into the Indiana program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 914 codifying decisions concerning the Indiana program are being amended to
implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment
process and to encourage States to bring their programs into conformity with the Federal standards without undue
delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Effect of Director's Decision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 503 of SMCRA provides that a State may not exercise jurisdiction under SMCRA unless the State program is approved
by the Secretary. Similarly, 30 CFR 732.17(a) requires that any alteration of an approved State program be submitted
to OSM for review as a program amendment. Thus, any changes to the State program are not enforceable until approved
by OSM. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.17(g) prohibit any unilateral changes to approved State programs. In
his oversight of the Indiana program, the Director will recognize only the statutes, regulations and other materials
approved by him, together with any consistent implementing policies, directives and other materials, and will require
the enforcement by Indiana of only such provisions.

VI. Procedural Determinations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12778
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections
(a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory
programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM.
Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15 and 732.17(h)(10), decisions
on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.

National Environmental Policy Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule

 on April 4, 1994. The revisions concern rules from the following air pollution control districts: Yolo-Solano Air
Pollution Control District (Yolo-Solano APCD), Placer County Air Pollution Control District (Placer County APCD),
and Ventura County Air Pollution Control District (Ventura County APCD). This approval action will incorporate
these rules into the federally approved SIP. The intended effect of approving these rules is to regulate emissions
of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA
or the Act). The revised rules control VOC emissions from cleaning and degreasing operations. Thus, EPA is finalizing
the approval of these revisions into the California SIP under provisions of the CAA regarding EPA action on SIP submittals,
SIPs for national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards and plan requirements for nonattainment areas.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 4, 1994 in 59 FR 15691, EPA proposed to approve the following rules into the California SIP: Yolo-Solano APCD's
Rule 2.24_Surface Cleaning Operations, Placer County APCD's Rule 216_Degreasing Operations, and Ventura County
APCD's Rule 74.6_Surface Cleaning and Degreasing. Rule 2.24 was adopted by Yolo-Solano APCD on November 14, 1990,
Rule 216 was adopted by Placer County APCD on September 25, 1990, and Rule 74.6 was adopted by Ventura County APCD on
December 10, 1991. These rules were submitted by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to EPA on May 13, 1991, April
5, 1991, and June 19, 1992, respectively. These rules were submitted in response to EPA's 1988 SIP-Call and the CAA
section 182(a)(2)(A) requirement that nonattainment areas fix their reasonably available control technology
(RACT) rules for ozone in accordance with EPA guidance that interpreted the requirements of the pre-amendment Act.
A detailed discussion of the background for each of the above rules and nonattainment areas is provided in the NPRM
cited above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has evaluated all of the above rules for consistency with the requirements of the CAA and EPA regulations and EPA
interpretation of these requirements as expressed in the various EPA policy guidance documents referenced in the
NPRM cited above. EPA has found that the rules meet the applicable EPA requirements. A detailed discussion of the rule
provisions and evaluations has been provided in 59 FR 15691 and in technical support documents (TSDs) available at
EPA's Region IX office (TSDs dated August 6, 1993 for Rules 2.24, 216, and 74.6).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 21, 1994 in 59 FR 48410, EPA proposed to approve the following rule into the California SIP: SBCAPCD's
Rule 342, Control of Oxides of Nitrogen (NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) from Boilers, Steam Generators, and Process Heaters. Rule 342 was adopted by SBCAPCD on March 10, 1992. The California
Air Resources Board (CARB) submitted this rule to EPA on June 19, 1992. Rule 342 was adopted as part of Santa Barbara
County's efforts to achieve the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone and in response to Section
182(f) NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 RACT requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has evaluated Rule 342 for consistency with the requirements of the CAA and EPA regulations and EPA interpretation
of these requirements as expressed in the various EPA policy guidance documents referenced in the NPRM cited above.
EPA has found that the rule meets the applicable EPA requirements. A detailed discussion of the rule provisions and
evaluation has been provided in 59 FR 48410 and in the technical support document (TSD), dated May 1994 available at
EPA's Region IX office.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is finalizing the approval of revisions to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) proposed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 19, 1994 and August 24, 1994. The revisions concern rules from the following districts: the San Diego County
Air Pollution Control District (SDCAPCD), the San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution Control District (SJVUAPCD),
and the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD). This approval action will incorporate these rules
into the Federally approved SIP. The intended effect of approving these rules is to regulate emissions of volatile
organic compounds (VOCs) in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act).
The revised rules control VOC emissions from surface cleaning and degreasing operations, oil sump operations, storage
of materials containing VOCs, and operations related to the loading of marine tank vessels. Thus, EPA is finalizing
the approval of these revisions into the California SIP under provisions of the CAA regarding EPA action on SIP submittals,
SIPs for national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards and plan requirements for nonattainment areas.

On August 24, 1994 in 59 FR 43521, EPA proposed to approve the following rules into the California SIP: SDCAPCD Rule
67.6, Solvent Cleaning Operations; SDCAPCD Rule 67.17, Storage of Materials Containing Volatile Organic Compounds;
SJVUAPCD Rule 461.1, Organic Solvent Degreasing Operations; and SJVUAPCD Rule 465.2, Crude Oil Production Sumps.
SCAQMD Rule 1142, Marine Tank Vessel Operations, was proposed for approval into the California SIP on July 19, 1994
in 59 FR 36731. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

by the CARB on January 28, 1992. These rules were submitted in response to EPA's 1988 SIP-Call and the CAA section 182(a)(2)(A)
requirement that nonattainment areas fix their reasonably available control technology (RACT) rules for ozone
in accordance with EPA guidance that interpreted the requirements of the pre-amended Act. A detailed discussion
of the background for each of the above rules and nonattainment areas is provided in the Notices of Proposed Rulemaking
(NPRMs) cited above.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA approves the State implementation plan (SIP) revisions submitted by the State of Montana with a letter dated March
2, 1994. This submittal addresses the Federal Clean Air Act requirement to submit contingency measures for both particulate
matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) and for carbon monoxide (CO) for the areas in Missoula designated as nonattainment for the PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 and CO National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Further, this submittal satisfies several commitments made
by the State in a previous PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP submittal. Due to the completion of those commitments, EPA is approving the related rules of the Missoula City-County
Air Pollution Control Program, as adopted by the Montana Board of Health and Environmental Sciences (MBHES) on June
28, 1991 and amended on March 20, 1992 and November 19, 1993, and submitted by the Governor in letters dated August 20,
1991, June 4, 1992, and March 2, 1994. These rules include regulations regarding inspections, emergency procedures,
minor source construction permitting, open burning, and wood waste burners. EPA also approves minor revisions to
the previously approved Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program's Chapters VII and VIII, as included
in the March 2, 1994 submittal. Further, EPA is declining to take action on Missoula's minor source operating permit
regulations. Finally, EPA disapproves Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program's Chapter X, Variances,
which was submitted on August 20, 1991.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Missoula, Montana area was designated nonattainment for PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and classified as moderate under sections 107(d)(4)(B) and 188(a) of the Clean Air Act, upon enactment of the Clean
Air Act Amendments of 1990.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 See 56 FR 56694 (Nov. 6, 1991); 40 CFR 81.327 (Missoula and vicinity). The air quality planning requirements for moderate
PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment areas are set out in subparts 1 and 4 of part D, title I of the Act.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The EPA has issued a ``General Preamble'' describing EPA's preliminary views on how EPA intends to review SIPs and
SIP revisions submitted under Title I of the Act, including those State submittals containing moderate PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment area SIP requirements (see generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992)).
Because EPA is describing its interpretations here only in broad terms, the reader should refer to the General Preamble
for a more detailed discussion of the interpretations of title I advanced in this action and the supporting rationale.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment areas such as Missoula were required to submit, among other things, several provisions by November

 nonattainment area SIP (59 FR 2537&hyph;2540, January 18, 1994). Such States were also required to submit contingency
measures by November 15, 1993 (see 57 FR 13543). These measures must become effective, without further action by the
State or EPA, upon a determination by EPA that the area has failed to achieve reasonable further progress (RFP) or to
attain the PM

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

On November 15, 1990, the Missoula area was also designated nonattainment and classified as a moderate area for CO
by operation of law. See section 107(d)(4)(B) of the Act; 56 FR 56694 at 56705&hyph;56706, 56790 (November 6, 1991);
40 CFR 81.327 (Missoula and vicinity). Unlike PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment areas, moderate CO areas with a design value of less than or equal to 12.7 parts per million (including
Missoula) are not required by the Act to submit a SIP demonstrating attainment of the NAAQS. Rather, these areas are
required to submit certain SIP elements, including an oxygenated fuels program, an emissions inventory, and contingency
measures. Section 172(c)(9) of the Act requires the State to submit contingency measures for implementation in the
event that the area fails to reach attainment by the applicable attainment date (December 31, 1995). EPA has established
November 15, 1993 as the deadline by which the contingency measures must be submitted to EPA as a SIP revision.

II. This Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565&hyph;13566).
The Governor of Montana submitted revisions to the SIP for Missoula with a letter dated March 2, 1994. The revisions
address contingency measures for PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and CO, and they also amend several of the Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA approved a large portion of the Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program on January 18, 1994 (59 FR 2537&hyph;2540).
Some of the local regulation amendments, which are included in the March 2, 1994 submittal, were made to satisfy commitments
made by the Governor with the original PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP submittal. In the January 18, 1994 rulemaking, EPA delayed action on the regulations related to the Governor's
commitments.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To address deficiencies identified by EPA, the State took commitments through the public hearing process on November
23, 1992, and submitted the commitments to EPA as additional tasks to be completed to correct the deficiencies in the
Missoula and statewide SIP (a more detailed discussion of these commitments can be found in EPA's prior proposed rulemaking

 SIP revisions for Missoula (58 FR 48339, September 15, 1993), the Technical Support Document (TSD) for that action,
Section II.E. below, and the TSD for this action). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to the satisfaction of those commitments, EPA is now approving the following Missoula City-County Air Pollution
Control Program regulations as adopted by the State of Montana on June 28, 1991 and submitted to EPA by Montana's Governor
on August 20, 1991, with amendments adopted by the State on March 20, 1992 and November 19, 1993 and submitted to EPA
by the Governor on June 4, 1992 and March 2, 1994, respectively: Chapter IX_Subchapter 4, Emergency Procedures; Subchapter
13, Open Burning; and Subchapter 14, Rule 1407, Wood-Waste Burners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is also approving the following minor revisions to two previously approved chapters of the Missoula City-County
Air Pollution Control Program_revisions to Chapter VII, involving a name change for the advisory council, and revisions
to Chapter VIII, regarding inspections. These revisions were also adopted by the State on November 19, 1993 and were
included in the March 2, 1994 submittal.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act requires States to observe certain procedural requirements in developing implementation plans and plan
revisions for submission to EPA. Section 110(a)(2) of the Act provides that each implementation plan submitted by
a State must be adopted after reasonable notice and public hearing.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 110(l) of the Act similarly provides that each revision to an implementation plan submitted by a State under
the Act must be adopted by such State after reasonable notice and public hearing.

EPA also must determine whether a submittal is complete and therefore warrants further EPA review and action (see
Section 110(k)(1) and 57 FR 13565). The EPA's completeness criteria for SIP submittals are set out at 40 CFR part 51,
appendix V. The EPA attempts to make completeness determinations within 60 days of receiving a submission. However,
a submittal is deemed complete by operation of law if a completeness determination is not made by EPA six months after
receipt of the submission.

To entertain public comment, the State of Montana, after providing adequate notice, held public hearings for the
local air pollution control program on June 28, 1991 and March 2, 1992, and a hearing was held on November 19, 1993 to
address the Missoula contingency measures and further revisions to the local air pollution control program regulations.
Following the public hearings, the local air pollution control plan, revisions, and the Missoula contingency measures
were adopted by the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The local air pollution control program was submitted as a proposed revision to the SIP by the Governor with a letter
dated August 20, 1991. In a letter to the State dated December 4, 1991, EPA identified deficiencies with the local program.
Some of these deficiencies were addressed in the Missoula PM

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP, which was submitted by the Governor to EPA in a letter dated June 4, 1992. Commitments to correct the remaining
deficiencies were submitted by the Governor in a letter dated November 30, 1992. EPA described the commitments and
approved the provisions of the local program that were not affected by these commitments on January 18, 1994 (59 FR
2537). A detailed description of the Missoula City-County regulations that are the subject of this action, the deficiencies
that EPA identified in its December 4, 1991 letter to the State, the State's commitments to address these deficiencies,
and the current revisions is contained in the TSD for this action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SIP revisions were reviewed by EPA to determine completeness in accordance with the completeness criteria set
out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V. The submittals were found to be complete and letters dated December 4, 1991, December
11, 1992, and May 12, 1994 were forwarded to the Governor indicating the completeness of the submittals and the next
steps to be taken in the review process.

B. Contingency Measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Clean Air Act requires State's containing PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment areas to adopt contingency measures that will take effect without further action by the State or EPA
upon a determination by EPA that an area failed to make reasonable further progress or to timely attain the applicable
NAAQS, as described in section 172(c)(9). See generally 57 FR 13510&hyph;13512 and 13543&hyph;13544. Pursuant
to section 172(b), the Administrator has established a schedule providing that states containing initial moderate
PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment areas shall submit SIP revisions containing contingency measures no later than November 15, 1993.
(See 57 FR 13543, n. 3.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The General Preamble further explains that contingency measures for PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 should consist of other available control measures, beyond those necessary to meet the core moderate area control
requirement to implement reasonably available control measures (see Clean Air Act sections 172(c)(1) and 189(a)(1)(C)).
Based on the statutory structure, EPA believes that contingency measures must, at a minimum, provide for continued
progress toward the attainment goal during the interim period between the determination that the SIP has failed to
achieve RFP/provide for timely attainment of the NAAQS and the additional formal air quality planning following
the determination (57 FR 13511).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act similarly requires that states containing certain CO nonattainment areas to adopt contingency measures
that will take effect without further action by the State or EPA upon a determination by EPA that an area failed to make
reasonable further progress or to attain the standards, as described in section 172(c)(9). (``Not Classified''
areas, that is, areas that had a design value less than the 9.0 part per million CO NAAQS at the time of designation, are
not required to submit contingency measures.) Pursuant to section 172(b), the Administrator has established a schedule
providing that states containing areas not exempted from the contingency measure requirement shall submit SIP revisions
containing contingency measures no later than November 15, 1993. EPA guidance (``Technical Support Document to
Aid States with the Development of Carbon Monoxide State Implementation Plans,'' EPA&hyph;452/R&hyph;92&hyph;003,
July 1992) recommends that implementation of the contingency measures provide vehicle miles travelled (VMT) reductions
or emission reductions sufficient to counteract the effect of one year's growth in VMT. However, the Act does not specify
how many contingency measures are needed or the magnitude of emissions reductions that must be provided by these measures.
In the interim period (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, after an area fails to attain and while required additional measures are being adopted due to being reclassified
to serious), EPA believes that contingency measures must provide for continued progress toward the attainment goal.
This would be the minimum requirement and is consistent with the statutory scheme. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(9) of the Act specifies that contingency measures shall ``take effect *&blank;*&blank;* without
further action by the State, or the [EPA] Administrator.'' EPA has interpreted this requirement (in the General Preamble
at 57 FR 13512) to mean that no further rulemaking activities by the State or EPA would be needed to implement the contingency
measures. In general, EPA expects all actions needed to affect full implementation of the measures to occur within
60 days after EPA notifies the State of its failure to attain the standard or make RFP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA recognizes that certain actions, such as notification of sources, modification of permits, etc., may be needed
before some measures could be implemented. However, States must show that their contingency measures can be implemented
with minimal further administrative action on their part and with no additional rulemaking action such as public
hearing or legislative review.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and CO contingency measures for Missoula were developed by the Missoula City-County Health Department (MCCHD),
with input from the Montana Department of Health and Environmental Sciences (MDHES). After a local public hearing
on September 16, 1993, the Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Board adopted the measures. At its November
19, 1993 MBHES public hearing, the Board adopted the contingency measures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Governor submitted the contingency measures to EPA with a letter dated March 2, 1994. After reviewing the submittal
for conformance with the completeness criteria in 40 CFR part 51, appendix V, EPA determined the submittal to be administratively
and technically complete and notified the Governor of such determination in a letter dated May 12, 1994.

C. Effectiveness of the Contingency Measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the re-entrained road dust contingency measure is implemented, the control efficiency of the re-entrained road
dust measures will be 76% in the 24-hour attainment demonstration (an increase of 14% over the control efficiency
of the re-entrained road dust measures in the original SIP attainment demonstration). This calculation takes into
account the expanded area for using washed sand, the existing areas for using washed sand and liquid de-icer, and the
existing street sweeping measures (see the TSD for the Missoula PM

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP for further details on the existing re-entrained road dust strategies). Total reduction from the contingency
measure is calculated to be 4073 pounds of PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since no credit was taken for the residential woodburning measures in the original SIP attainment demonstration,
control efficiency from the residential woodburning contingency measure increases in the 24-hour attainment demonstration.
See the TSD for the Missoula PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP for further details on the existing residential woodburning strategies (available at the EPA Region VIII address
listed at the beginning of this notice). Total reduction from the contingency measure would be 12.6 pounds of PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 per day. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes this contingency measure is adequate for several reasons. First, the existing Missoula solid fuel burning
device regulation (Rule 1428) is already a very stringent mandatory curtailment program. Any further emissions
reductions through this program are very difficult to achieve. Second, the emissions inventory for the Missoula
area indicates that re-entrained road dust contributes a somewhat higher portion of the PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions than residential woodburning. Therefore, the analysis necessary for the contingency measure selection
process most likely will indicate that residential woodburning is not the major contributing source to Missoula's
failure to attain the PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS or make RFP, and that the re-entrained road dust contingency measure should be implemented instead of the woodburning
measure. Finally, the control measures implemented in the PM

3. Residential Woodburning Contingency Measure for CO 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With the implementation of the residential woodburning contingency measure, Class I devices will not be allowed
to burn during an alert. Assuming a conservative 60% compliance rate, 7,915 pounds of CO per day will be reduced. Since
the estimated one-year growth of vehicle miles travelled (VMT) is 1%, and the CO emissions inventory report has determined
that 140,786 pounds of CO per day are emitted from automobiles, approximately 1,409 pounds of CO per day are needed
for a sufficient amount of reduction from the contingency measure. Therefore, emissions reductions are adequately
met with the implementation of this contingency measure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Early Implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subchapter 3, Contingency Measure Selection Process, of the Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program's
Chapter IX_Regulations, Standards, &amp; Permits_sets out its early implementation policy as follows. For either
the PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or CO contingency measures, early implementation of the measures will not result in the requirement to implement
additional moderate area contingency measures if the area fails to attain the NAAQS or make reasonable further progress
in reducing emissions. However, if Missoula is reclassified to a serious nonattainment area, additional planning
requirements, including, but not limited to, serious area contingency measures, would be necessary. (See 59 FR 41998,
August 16, 1994.)

In a letter dated August 20, 1991, the Governor of Montana submitted to EPA the Missoula City-County Air Pollution
Control Program as a revision to the Montana SIP. EPA's review identified numerous deficiencies, including inconsistencies
with the State regulations, as well as deficiencies similar to those EPA identified in the State regulations. In a
December 4, 1991 letter from the EPA Region VIII Administrator to the Governor of Montana, the deficiencies in the
Missoula regulations were outlined in detail (this letter is available for public inspection at the EPA Region VIII
address listed at the beginning of this notice). The problem areas included rules involving emergency procedures,
permitting, open burning, wood-waste burners, National standards of performance for new stationary sources (NSPS),
National emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAPs), and variances.

The revisions to the Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program regulations, which were submitted by the
Governor with a letter dated March 2, 1994, fulfill four of the State's commitments (see A, B, C, and E above). However,
EPA still has concerns with respect to the minor source operating permit regulations (see below). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional information submitted to Doug Skie, EPA, from Jeff Chaffee, MDHES, in a letter dated June 9, 1994 fulfills
one more commitment (see D above). In this letter, the State indicated that there is no need for Missoula to revise its
open burning regulations. The State revised its open burning regulations to prohibit the burning of creosote railroad
ties (revisions adopted by the Montana Board of Health and Environmental Sciences at its May 20, 1994 hearing), and
the Missoula regulation already prohibits such burning. Therefore, the State does not believe that revisions to
Missoula's open burning regulations are required at this time.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Therefore, EPA is now approving the following portions of Chapter IX of the Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control
Program, as submitted in a letter dated August 20, 1991, with revisions submitted in letters dated June 4, 1992 and
March 2, 1994_Subchapters 4 and 13, and Subchapter 14, Rule 1407_addressing emergency procedures, open burning,
and wood-waste burners, respectively. EPA is also approving all portions of Subchapter 11_Permit, Construction,
and Operation of Air Contaminant Sources_except Rules 1102(3), 1105(2), and 1111(2). The portions of Subchapter
11 that EPA is approving relate to construction permits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although EPA is approving Missoula's construction permit regulations of Subchapter 11 as part of the SIP, EPA's approval
does not include Missoula's minor source operating permit regulations, which are found in Chapter IX: Subchapter
11, Rules 1102(3), 1105(2), and 1111(2). EPA is declining to take action on these minor source operating permit regulations
because they do not meet the criteria of the June 28, 1989 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice, which are required in order for the minor source operating permits to be considered federally enforceable
(see 54 FR 27282). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also included in the March 2, 1994 submittal are minor amendments to two previously approved chapters of the Missoula
City-County Air Pollution Control Program. These revisions involve a name change for the air advisory council listed
in Chapter VII, and amendments to Chapter VIII, to provide for emergency episode inspections of operating point sources,
which are capable of emitting 25 tons or more per year of any regulated air pollutant, to ensure compliance with abatement
plan requirements. EPA approves these revisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's concerns regarding Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program, Chapter X, Variances, as included
with the August 20, 1991 submittal, have not been addressed. In the December 4, 1991 letter to the Governor, EPA informed
the State that section 110(i) of the Federal Clean Air Act, as amended, prohibits the suspension of any requirement
of an applicable SIP from being taken with respect to a stationary source by a State or the Administrator of EPA, except
by SIP revision under section 110(a) (and a few other exceptions). Neither the June 4, 1992 submittal, nor the March
2, 1994 submittal, corrected this problem. Therefore, EPA must disapprove Missoula's Chapter X, Variances, at this
time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the November 30, 1992 Governor's commitments regarding Missoula is still outstanding. That commitment addresses
Missoula NSPS and NESHAP regulations (see (F), above). EPA will take separate action on those regulations, as appropriate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Enforceability Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All measures and other elements in the SIP must be enforceable by the State and EPA (see Sections 172(c)(6), 110(a)(2)(A)
and 57 FR 13556). The EPA criteria addressing the enforceability of SIPs and SIP revisions were stated in a September
23, 1987 memorandum (with attachments) from J. Craig Potter, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (see 57 FR 13541). State implementation plan provisions also must contain a program to provide for enforcement of
control measures and other elements in the SIP [see section 110(a)(2)(C)]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The specific measures contained in the Missoula contingency plan are addressed above in Section II.B. The Missoula
air pollution control regulations, as included in the SIP, are legally enforceable by MCCHD. There are civil penalties,
which increase with each violation, for noncompliance with the solid fuel burning device regulation. Violation
of any other provision, regulation or rule enforced under the program results in a criminal offense punishable by
a fine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program regulations are also enforceable by the MDHES, if the MCCHD
fails to administer the program. Since the program has been approved by the MBHES in accordance with Section 75&hyph;2&hyph;301
of the Montana Clean Air Act and effectuated by an MBHES order, and since the MDHES can enforce MBHES orders, the MDHES
has independent enforcement powers. Enforcement provisions are found in the Clean Air Act of Montana, Sections 75&hyph;2&hyph;401&hyph;429,
Montana Code Annotated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a State relies on a local government for the implementation of any plan provision, then, according to Section 110(a)(2)(E)(iii)
of the Act, the State must provide necessary assurances that the State has responsibility for ensuring adequate implementation
of such plan provision. A State would have responsibility to ensure adequate implementation if, for example, the
State has the authority and resources to implement the provision when the local entity has failed to do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program was established in accordance with the requirements of Section
75&hyph;2&hyph;301 of the Montana Clean Air Act, as amended (1991). A revised version of the air pollution control
regulations was approved by the Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Board on April 24, 1991, and on June 28,
1991 the MBHES issued a board order approving these regulations. A stipulation between the MDHES and the Missoula
City-County Air Pollution Control Board that delineates responsibilities and authorities between the MDHES and
the local authorities was signed April 29, 1991. On March 20, 1992, the MBHES issued a board order approving revisions
to the Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program. The April 29, 1991 stipulation, the June 28, 1991 Board
order, and the March 20, 1992 Board order were incorporated into the SIP on January 18, 1994 (59 FR 2540).

On November 19, 1993, the MBHES issued a Board order approving the Missoula PM

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and CO contingency measures and revisions to the Missoula City-County regulations. These regulations and the November
19, 1993 Board order were submitted to EPA as a modification to the Montana SIP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Missoula City-County rules are in effect now. The State of Montana has a program that will ensure that the contingency
measures contained in the Missoula SIP are adequately enforced. EPA believes that the State's and Missoula's existing
air enforcement program will be adequate. The TSD for this action contains further information on enforceability
requirements, responsibilities, and a discussion of the personnel and funding intended to support effective implementation
of the control measures.

III. Final Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is approving Montana's SIP revisions, submitted by the Governor with a letter dated March 2, 1994, for the Missoula,
Montana nonattainment area. This submittal addressed PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and CO contingency measure plans that were due on November 15, 1993. These plans involve the incorporation of a new
Subchapter 3 (Contingency Measure Selection Process) in Chapter IX of the Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control
Program and revisions to Chapter IX, Subchapter 14, Rule 1401 (regarding the contingency measure to expand the area
of regulated road sanding materials) and Rule 1428 (regarding the contingency measure to void certain solid fuel
burning device permits). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The March 2, 1994 submittal also revised several Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program regulations,
as committed to be completed by the Governor of Montana to EPA in a letter dated November 30, 1992. Due to the satisfaction
of those commitments, EPA can now approve the following portions of Chapter IX of the Missoula City-County Air Pollution
Control Program, as submitted on August 20, 1991, with revisions submitted June 4, 1992, and March 2, 1994: (1) Subchapter
4, Emergency Procedures; (2) all portions of Subchapter 11, Permit, Construction, and Operation of Contaminant
Sources_except Rules 1102(3), 1105(2), and 1111(2) (the portions of Subchapter 11 that EPA is approving relate to
construction permits); (3) Subchapter 13, Open Burning; and (4) Subchapter 14, Rule 1407, Wood-Waste Burners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although EPA is approving Missoula's construction permit regulations of Subchapter 11 as part of the SIP, EPA's approval
does not include Missoula's minor source operating permit regulations. EPA is declining to take action on Missoula's
minor source operating permit regulations, which are found in Chapter IX: Subchapter 11, Rules 1102(3), 1105(2),
and 1111(2), because they do not meet the criteria of the June 28, 1989 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 document. These criteria must be met in order for the minor source operating permits to be considered federally enforceable
(see 54 FR 27282). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also approves minor revisions to previously approved Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program Chapter
VII and Chapter VIII, as included in the March 2, 1994 submittal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, EPA is disapproving Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program, Chapter X, Variances, as adopted
by the MBHES on June 28, 1991, and submitted by the Governor of Montana in a letter dated August 20, 1991. This chapter
is not consistent with section 110(i) of the Clean Air Act, which prohibits any State or EPA from granting a variance
from any requirement of an applicable implementation plan with respect to a stationary source. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment
and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 publication, EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be filed. Under the
procedures established in the May 10, 1994 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 24054), this action will be effective February 13, 1995 unless, by January 12, 1995, adverse or critical comments
are received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If such comments are received, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a subsequent
final rule based on this action serving as a proposed rule. EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action.
Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If no such comments are received, the
public is advised that this action will be effective on February 13, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to a SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approvals of SIP submittals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements,
but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval
does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on small entities affected.
Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the Clean Air Act, preparation of a regulatory
flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Clean
Air Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's disapproval_of the portion of the submittal containing Missoula's variance rule_under section 110 and subchapter
I, part D of the Clean Air Act does not affect any existing requirements applicable to small entities. Any pre-existing
Federal requirements remain in place after this disapproval. Federal disapproval of the state submittal does not
affect its state-enforceability. Moreover, EPA's disapproval of the submittal does not impose any new Federal requirements.
Therefore, EPA certifies that this disapproval action does not have a significant impact on a substantial number
of small entities because it does not remove existing requirements nor does it impose any new Federal requirements.

Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by February 13, 1995. Filing a petition for reconsideration by
the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor
does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review must be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements (see section
307(b)(2)).

The Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program's Chapter X, Variances, which was adopted by the Montana
Board of Health and Environmental Sciences on June 28, 1991 and submitted by the Governor of Montana to EPA in a letter
dated August 20, 1991, is disapproved. This rule is inconsistent with section 110(i) of the Clean Air Act, which prohibits
any State or EPA from granting a variance from any requirement of an applicable implementation plan with respect to
a stationary source.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Hazardous Materials Transportation Uniform Safety Act (HMTUSA) of 1990, Public Law 101&hyph;615, enacted on
November 16, 1990, amends the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (HMTA) (49 U.S.C. Appendix 1801 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) by authorizing the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) of the National Institutes of Health
to administer a program of grants to qualified non-profit organizations for the purpose of providing training and
education to hazardous materials employees regarding the safe unloading, loading, handling, storage and transportation
of hazardous materials and emergency preparedness for responding to accidents or incidents involving the transportation
of hazardous materials in order to meet the training requirements issued under section 106(b) of the HMTA. Section
118 of the HMTA directs NIEHS to administer the Hazmat Employee Training Grant Program in consultation with the Secretary
of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
and the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL). The grants are funded from the collection of fees, as specified
under section 117A(h) of the HMTA, which are collected from the transporters of hazardous materials on an annual basis.
Funds to support the grant program are transferred 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from DOT to NIEHS on an annual basis through an Interagency Agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule amends regulations at 42 CFR part 65 governing the NIEHS Hazardous Waste Worker Training Grants Program
to make them applicable to the new Hazmat Employee Training Grants Program. Specifically, the authority citation
for part 65 is amended to include the authority for the new training grants (49 U.S.C. App. 1816); &sect;65.1 is amended
by revising paragraphs (a), (b) concluding text and (c) introductory text to set forth the applicability of part 65
to the Hazmat Employee Training Grant Program; and &sect;65.2 is amended by deleting the definition of ``Act'' and
adding definitions of the acronyms ``SARA'' and ``HMTA'' and by revising the definition of ``Award or grant.'' Additionally,
references to ``section 126 of the Act'' found in sections 65.1, 65.4 and 65.5 of the part 65 are revised to read ``section
126 of the SARA or section 118 of the HMTA.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, Public Law 103&hyph;227, enacted on March 31, 1994, prohibits smoking in certain facilities in which minors
will be present. The Department of Health and Human Services is now preparing to implement the provisions of that law.
Until those implementation plans are in place, PHS continues to strongly encourage all grant recipients to provide
a smoke-free workplace and promote the nonuse of all tobacco products.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 29, 1993, NIH published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 announcing our plans to amend the regulations governing the Hazardous Waste Worker Training Program at 42 CFR part
65 by making these changes and invited public comment. We received two comments on the proposed changes. These comments
were received from the George Meany Center for Labor Studies and the Chemical Waste Transportation Institute of the
National Solid Wastes Management Association. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The George Meany Center for Labor Studies suggested that the inclusion of both planning grants and program grants
in part 65 is inconsistent with section 118(c) of the amended HMTA which restricts funding to ``non-profit organizations
which previously have demonstrated their expertise in implementing and operating hazmat employee training and
education programs.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 While planning grants are an option for NIEHS in the overall training program under the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization
Act of 1986 (SARA), it would not be an option with the HMTA Hazmat Employee Training Grant Program since the statute
is so narrowly drawn. In response to the comment, we have clarified &sect;65.1 (c) to indicate that planning grants
are available only under SARA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Chairman of the Chemical Waste Transportation Institute suggested the title heading of part 65 be expanded to
make reference to both types of grants programs. He suggested the heading be altered to read: ``NIEHS Hazardous Waste
Worker Training and Hazmat Employee Training Grant Programs.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NIEHS prefers to retain the original title heading of part 65 which is generically descriptive of the kinds of programs
covered, including additions of new programs related to hazardous waste worker training and additions to a program's
purview and statutory authority. The public will be notified of the availability of funds for particular programs
through the standard process of the issuance by NIH of Requests for Applications (RFA). Hence, there is no need for
changing the program's general title with every new statutory or regulatory amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, no changes have been made in the proposed rule, except for minor editorial changes.

Regulatory Impact Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order No. 12866 of September 30, 1993, Regulatory Planning and Review, requires us to prepare an analysis
for any rule that meets one of the E. O. 12866 criteria for a significant regulatory action; that is, that may_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 -->
Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal,
governments, or communities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set
forth in E.O. 12866. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, we prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5 U.S.C. chapter 6), if the rule is expected to have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because this rule merely makes minor changes in the authority citation, applicability section, and definitions
section to incorporate the new Hazmat Employee Training Grant Program authority into part 65, it will have no major
consequential effects on the economy or small entities. Therefore, the Secretary has determined that this rule is
not significant within the definition of E.O. 12866, and the Secretary certifies that this rule will not have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Paperwork Reduction Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 65.4(a), (b) and (c) of part 65 contain information collection requirements subject to Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) review under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35). The information collection
language in these sections is currently approved under OMB control number 0925&hyph;0348. Response burden in conjunction
with the program is approved under OMB control number 0925&hyph;0001. This rule does not result in any changes in the
language currently approved under control number 0925&hyph;0348.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule establishes as a condition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation (which facilities must meet in order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs) the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement that hospitals have a discharge planning process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for patients who require such services and specifies the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elements of that process. It also changes the required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualifications of a hospital's medical director. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions implement sections 9305(c) of the Omnibus Budget 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reconciliation Act of 1986 (OBRA '86) and 6025 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Also, we are not adopting several minor proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revisions to the conditions for coverage of suppliers of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
end-stage renal disease (ESRD) services. We are now 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developing comprehensive revisions to the ESRD regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and believe that it would be appropriate to reconsider the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed changes as part of that rulemaking process.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 16, 1988, we published a proposed rule (53 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22506) concerning discharge planning as a hospital condition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of participation, certain laboratory director qualifications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by recent legislation, and proposed revisions to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations aimed at reducing paperwork and information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collection requirements. In the proposal, we explained that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions of participation (conditions) are the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements that hospitals must meet in order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate in the Medicare program; hospitals that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate in the Medicaid program must meet the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. These conditions implement sections 1861(e), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f), (k), and (z) of the Social Security Act (the Act). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These conditions are intended to protect patient health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and safety and to help assure that high-quality care is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided to all patients. The current regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing the conditions of participation for hospitals are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
located in the Code of Federal Regulations at 42 CFR Part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
482, Subparts A, B, C, D, and E. Providers are surveyed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a State survey agency to ensure that they meet our 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation requirements. (Our regulations concerning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey and certification procedures for providers affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by this rule are at 42 CFR Part 488 unless otherwise noted.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hospitals accredited by the Joint Commission on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
American Osteopathic Association (AOA) are deemed under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1865 of the Act and &sect;488.5 of our regulations to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meet most of our requirements in the hospital conditions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation and need not be routinely surveyed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Failure to meet a condition of participation may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jeopardize the continuation of a facility's participation in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Medicare or Medicaid program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Discharge Planning Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Over the past 20 years, the average length of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospital stay has become significantly shorter for a number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of reasons. Factors contributing to this reduction include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment methods for hospitals, such as Medicare's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prospective payment system, which furnishes incentives to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospitals to retain only those patients needing care that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be safely furnished only in the inpatient hospital 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
setting. Additionally, increases in the aged population, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coupled with shorter lengths of hospital stays, have created 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a demand for rehabilitative and restorative treatments in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-hospital settings that can be furnished after hospital 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discharge. To assure the coordination needed to achieve a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
timely transition to post-hospital care, discharge planning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is necessary. It enables a hospital and patient to arrange 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for services that do not need to be furnished in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inpatient hospital setting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Our current regulations do not require discharge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
planning as a distinct condition of participation. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we include as a standard under the quality assurance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition (42 CFR 482.21(b)) the requirement that a hospital 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have an effective, ongoing discharge planning program that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilitates the provision of followup care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We require the hospital to initiate the discharge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
planning process in a timely manner and to transfer or refer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
patients, along with necessary medical information, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate facilities, agencies or outpatient services, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needed, for followup or ancillary services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Clinical Laboratory Director Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to assure the health and safety of patients, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
our conditions of participation for hospitals and conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for coverage of services of laboratories include standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that personnel, including laboratory directors, must meet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The clinical laboratory director requirements apply in all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, including those that have adopted their own 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualification requirements. When OBRA '86 was enacted, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it specified in section 9339(d) that if a State has standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a clinical laboratory director (including a hospital 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratory director) must meet, directors who meet these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards will be considered as meeting Federal standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We included this provision in our June 16, 1988 proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule. Subsequently, on October 31, 1988, the enactment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(CLIA), Public Law 100&hyph;578, drastically revised laboratory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements, obviating the proposal. Because the Medicare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision has been superseded, we are withdrawing our 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal and not discussing public comments in this final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule. (See our February 28, 1992 final rule (57 FR 7002) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the regulations implementing clinical laboratory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
director requirements under CLIA.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Other Revisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Following the summary of changes made to the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule based on our evaluation of public comments, we discuss 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in section VI of this preamble technical changes to our 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations concerning hospital medical director 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualifications. An unrelated change inserts in regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the new name adopted by the accrediting program of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Committee on Allied Health Education and Accreditation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These changes were not issued in a proposed rule. The first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change is technical and conforms the rules to the statute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without interpretation, while the second change merely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
updates the rules by substituting the new name of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accrediting program.

II. Legislation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 9305 (c)(1) and (c)(2) of OBRA '86 amends 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1861(e) of the Act, which defines ``hospital'', by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adding to paragraph (6) a requirement that a hospital have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in place a discharge planning process that meets the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of a new section 1861(ee) of the Act. Under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1861(ee), a discharge planning process of a hospital 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is sufficient if it applies to services furnished by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospital to Medicare beneficiaries and meets the guidelines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and standards established by the Secretary of HHS to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a timely and smooth transition to the most appropriate type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of setting for post-hospital or rehabilitative care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1861(ee) requires that the Secretary's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards and guidelines include the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The hospital must identify, at an early stage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospitalization, those patients who are likely to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suffer adverse health consequences if discharged without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate discharge planning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Hospitals must provide a discharge planning evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the patients identified under (1) above and for other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
patients upon request of the patient or his or her 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative or physician. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Any discharge planning evaluation must be made on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
timely basis to ensure that appropriate arrangements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
post-hospital care will be made before discharge and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
avoid unnecessary delays in discharge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A discharge planning evaluation must include an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation of a patient's likely need for appropriate post-hospital services and the availability of those services.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The discharge planning evaluation must be included in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the patient's medical record for use in establishing an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate discharge plan, and the results of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation must be discussed with the patient or his or her 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Upon the request of a patient's physician, the hospital 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must arrange for the development and initial implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a discharge plan for the patient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Any discharge planning evaluation or discharge plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required under section 1861(ee) of the Act must be developed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by, or under the supervision of, a registered professional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nurse, social worker, or other appropriately qualified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personnel. (Although the statute refers to a ``registered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professional nurse,'' both in this provision and in section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1861(e)(5) of the Act, there is no distinction between this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
term and ``registered nurse,'' which is more commonly used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We will hereafter use the term ``registered nurse'', to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with other references in our regulations.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 9305(c)(3) of OBRA '86 amends section 1865(a) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Act so that, in effect, when the JCAHO or AOA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires hospitals to have a discharge planning process or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposes a requirement that serves substantially the same purpose as the condition of participation for discharge

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
planning, the Secretary is authorized to find that those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospitals with JCAHO or AOA accreditation meet that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition of participation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions of section 9305(c) of OBRA '86 were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective October 21, 1987.

III. Provisions of the Proposed Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 16, 1988, we published a proposed rule to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement these legislative changes as well as the clinical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratory director standards revisions mentioned earlier 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(53 FR 22506). We also proposed several minor revisions to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the conditions for coverage of suppliers of ESRD services to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accommodate a request from the Office of Management and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Budget concerning paperwork burden and reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Discharge Planning Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To implement section 9305(c) of OBRA '86, we proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to incorporate the provisions of the statute and would add a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new hospital condition of participation, &sect;482.43, Discharge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
planning, which would have applied only to Medicare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
patients. We proposed to delete the current discharge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
planning requirement in &sect;482.21, Quality assurance, as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
medically-related patient care service standard applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to all patients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1861(ee) of the Act confers authority to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include standards and guidelines beyond those explicitly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enumerated in the statute. We proposed to specify that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discharge planning evaluation include an evaluation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare patient's capacity for self-care or the possibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this patient being cared for in the environment from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which he entered the hospital. Under the requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the discharge plan, we would require, on an as-needed basis, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the Medicare patient and family members or interested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
persons be counseled to prepare them for post-hospital care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For clarity, we wanted to include the concept in the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation explicitly requiring the actual transfer or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referral of Medicare patients after discharge planning is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete. We also proposed to require periodic reassessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Medicare patient's discharge plan to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether it needs to be changed. We would also require the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospital to reassess its discharge planning process on an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ongoing basis to ensure that it meets Medicare patients' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discharge needs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We deferred proposing any requirements relating to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needs assessment instrument that is being developed by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary as required by section 9305(h) of OBRA '86. On 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
June 30, 1992, HHS submitted a report on the needs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment instrument to Congress including recommendations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for further testing and development of the instrument.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statutory requirement, under section 1861(ee) of the Act, mandating the inclusion of discharge planning into
the hospital conditions of participation, explicitly applies only to Medicare beneficiaries. Although we believed
the Secretary had the authority to expand the application of the provision beyond the statutorily mandated population,
we did not choose to do so at the time we published the proposed rule, in part because we believed that additional development
of mechanisms for effectively completing and executing discharge plans was warranted before a requirement as detailed
as this one was made applicable beyond the mandated population. We have since changed our view and now are applying
the requirement to all patients who need it. (See section IV., ``Comments and Responses'', below for further discussion
of this issue.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the time of the proposal, we had not yet made a determination as authorized under section 9305(c)(3) as to whether
the JCAHO or AOA discharge planning standards were at least equivalent to the statutory standards and guidelines
in section 1861(ee) of the Act. Our current regulations at 42 CFR 488.5, as redesignated from 42 CFR 405.1901(d)(3)
on June 17, 1988 (53 FR 22850), already provide that JCAHO and AOA accredited hospitals are deemed to meet our conditions
of participation unless our requirements are higher or more precise. We indicated that we would review each organization's
standards to determine if they are at least equivalent and invited comments on this issue. We requested comments from
the public on this issue and proposed to announce in the final rule whether hospital compliance with the JCAHO or AOA
accreditation programs would provide the Secretary with a ``reasonable assurance'' that the hospital met the new
condition of participation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new section 1861(ee)(2)(B) includes the requirement that hospitals provide discharge planning evaluations
upon the request of the ``patient, patient's representative, or patient's physician.'' We proposed to characterize
``patient's representative'' in &sect;482.43(b)(1) as any properly authorized ``person acting on the patient's
behalf.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We proposed not to require hospitals to inform Medicare patients of the availability of discharge planning services
separately from other information furnished. Currently, hospitals give all Medicare patients a notice (``An Important
Message from Medicare'') that informs beneficiaries, among other things, of the availability of discharge planning.
This message was designed to help Medicare patients who may believe they need post-hospital services but do not know
how to obtain them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We proposed to allow hospitals to determine the appropriate personnel to carry out the discharge planning. In proposed
&sect;&sect;482.43(b)(2) and 482.43(c)(1), we stated that a registered nurse, social worker, or other appropriate
personnel (consistent with available community and hospital resources) must develop or supervise the development
of the evaluation and discharge plan. We did not stipulate in the regulation what qualifications would need to be related
to the size and location of the hospital and the variety of resources available for post-discharge care in the area.
In our interpretive guidelines, though, we would instruct the surveyor to look at such factors as previous experience
in discharge planning, knowledge of clinical and social factors that affect functional status at discharge, knowledge
of community resources to meet post-discharge clinical and social needs, and assessment skills. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To be compatible with our other regulations we proposed to divide this condition of participation into several standards:
the first, identification of Medicare patients in need of evaluation; the second, the evaluation process; the third,
the discharge plan; and the fourth, referral or transfer of the Medicare patient, along with necessary medical information.
(The statute does not explicitly require actual transfer or referral of patients after discharge planning is complete,
so we proposed to retain, for clarity, the concept of current &sect;482.21(b)(2).) A fifth standard would require
an ongoing reassessment of the discharge planning process to ensure that discharge plans are responsive to discharge
needs of individual Medicare patients. Because the requirements in &sect;482.43 (a), (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), (b)(5),
(b)(6), and (c)(2) would be those required by section 1861(ee) of the Act, failure to meet any of these requirements
could result in termination of the hospital's participation agreement in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.

B. ESRD Conditions for Coverage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We also proposed several minor revisions to &sect;&sect;405.2135 and 405.2137 of the ESRD conditions for coverage.
The purpose of the changes was to reduce the paperwork burden on ESRD facilities, in keeping with a request from the
office of Management and Budget that we conduct an overall review of the paperwork burden and reporting requirements
associated with HCFA regulations. We received no comments on the proposed changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At this time, however, we are working with representatives of the ESRD industry and consumers to develop comprehensive
revisions to the ESRD conditions for coverage. We believe that it would be confusing and inappropriate to adopt the
minor changes from the June 16, 1988 proposed rule at a time when the ESRD community is anticipating extensive revisions
to the conditions for coverage. Instead, we believe it would be more appropriate to reconsider the proposed changes
as part of our overall revision of the ESRD conditions. Thus, we are not adopting the proposed changes to &sect;&sect;405.2135
and 405.2137.

We received comments from 21 commenters on the proposed discharge planning provision, including a number of favorable
comments. The commenters consisted of hospitals, advocacy groups, local and State government agencies, individuals,
provider and supplier associations, and a medical equipment supplier.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter disagreed with our limiting the new condition of participation to Medicare patients only. He believed
we should extend coverage to all patients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree. We believe it is a good management practice for hospitals to assure continuity of care for all patients, and
we recognize that most hospitals achieve this result through discharge planning. In this regard, we note that the
JCAHO, which accredits approximately 6000 hospitals, has a discharge planning requirement that applies to all patients
and that is, in our view, even more comprehensive than the one required under the law and these regulations. The practical
effect of the JCAHO requirement is that discharge planning does apply to all patients in the vast majority of the nation's
hospitals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on our further review of the issue raised by this commenter, we now believe that the requirements in this regulation,
which will be applied in the approximately 1500 hospitals not accredited by the JCAHO, should be applied to all patients
who need them. Accordingly, under the authority contained in section 1861(e)(9) and 1861(ee)(1), we are expanding
the applicability of the discharge planning requirements to all hospital patients who require it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are several reasons why we believe it is appropriate to expand the discharge planning requirement to all patients.
First, expanding the requirement to all patients is consistent with the requirements set forth in current &sect;482.21,
which has been in place since June 17, 1986 (51 FR 22042). Section 482.21(b) includes a discharge planning requirement
that applies to all patients, Moreover, the commenter's suggestion also is consistent with our long-standing position
that the Secretary's responsibility under section 1861(e)(9) of the Act to promulgate health and safety requirements
for hospitals applies to all patients. Rather than limiting the Secretary's responsibilities to Medicare beneficiaries,
section 1861(e)(9) refers to the ``health and safety of individuals who are furnished services in the institution.''
Thus, the statute supports our decision to require that the new discharge planning procedures be applicable, as the
old procedures were, to all of a hospital's patients. Clearly, adequate discharge planning is essential to the health
and safety of all patients. It is not just the Medicare patient that may suffer adverse health consequences upon discharge
without the benefit of appropriate planning. Such planning is vital to mapping a course of treatment aimed at minimizing
the likelihood of having any patient rehospitalized for the reasons that prompted the initial hospital stay. To this
extent, all of the elements of the discharge planning process that Congress has made explicitly applicable to Medicare
beneficiaries are of equal value to all hospital patients in the interests of their health and safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, expanding the scope of the discharge planning provisions would parallel current JCAHO and AOA
requirements, which also apply to all patients. We do not believe that it is administratively feasible to separate
Medicare and other patients for discharge planning purposes. Furthermore, such a separation of Medicare and other
patients for discharge planning purposes might have the adverse affect of fostering a dual level of care system for
Medicare and other patients. The discriminatory aspects of such a situation would be neither desirable nor supportable.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, we do not believe that the cost of expanding the application of the requirement is significant. There will
be no expense in the approximately 6000 hospitals accredited by the JCAHO. Moreover, in the approximately 1500 hospitals
directly subject to the requirement, the marginal impact on hospital staffing is likely to be relatively small. Since
our current hospital conditions of participation already require discharge planning, hospital staff must already
be employed to carry out this function. We believe that the new discharge planning provisions impose only a minimal
additional workload on these staff, and applying these requirements to all patients, rather than just to Medicare
beneficiaries, will not have a significant incremental impact.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters explicitly suggested and many others implicitly suggested that we require written policies and procedures
for the discharge planning process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree and are revising proposed &sect;482.43 to require the hospital to commit its discharge planning policies
and procedures to writing. This requirement will help assure that the process is well thought out, clear, comprehensive
and understood by all staff. It will also assist in monitoring the process. We believe most hospitals already have
written discharge planning policies and procedures and will have little or no difficulty in complying with this requirement.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We received five comments on the equivalency of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the JCAHO's standards to ours. Two commenters believe the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
JCAHO's standards for discharge planning (and supporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards for social work services and nursing services) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be equivalent to ours, while two believe them not to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We have reviewed JCAHO's 1994 standards and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
find them to be at least equivalent to those in this final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation. Included in our determination finding them 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent was a consideration of the JCAHO's standards for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
patient assessment and education of patients and family. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are announcing that JCAHO-accredited hospitals that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate in Medicare have been found by the Secretary and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA to meet the new discharge planning requirement in 42 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CFR 482.43. Those hospitals will not have to be surveyed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for compliance with this requirement when the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation becomes effective. For these reasons, we believe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no revision of the regulations at 42 CFR 488.5(a) is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The fifth commenter was philosophically opposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to accepting the equivalency of the JCAHO's discharge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
planning standards to ours because he believed a private 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency is not accountable to the government for enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of its standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We cannot accept the commenter's contention 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a private agency should not be used to enforce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
government standards, as the statute explicitly authorizes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this type of use of a private agency (section 1865(a) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act). In order to ensure that the hospitals the JCAHO 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accredits are meeting standards equivalent to HCFA's, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conduct validation surveys under section 1864(c) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hospitals found out of compliance with conditions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation may have their provider agreements terminated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if they do not correct their deficiencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We received one comment concerning the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalency of AOA standards to ours. The commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believed that the AOA's discharge planning standards are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more general than HCFA's but that they would be strengthened 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to meet new Medicare standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We agree that AOA standards on discharge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
planning in effect at the time the commenters commented were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not equal to or higher than ours. We are pleased to report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the AOA subsequently revised its standards for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discharge planning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are announcing that AOA-accredited hospitals that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate in Medicare have been found by the Secretary and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA to meet the new discharge planning requirement in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
42 CFR 482.43. These hospitals will not have to be surveyed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for compliance with this requirement when the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation becomes effective. For these reasons, we believe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no revision of the regulations at 42 CFR 488.5(a) is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two commenters believed we should require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospitals to identify all Medicare patients, particularly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
high risk patients, in need of post-hospital care, within 24 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hours of being admitted, including, for one commenter, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
patients appearing in the emergency room, whether or not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they are admitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We do not agree that a 24-hour limitation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be imposed on the identification requirement. Both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the statute and the regulation require identification to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
take place ``at an early stage of hospitalization.'' We think 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this is sufficient because the specific timing of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identification within that context, we believe, is best left 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the hospital, its staff, and the attending physician. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Discharge planning presupposes hospital admission and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 9305(c) of OBRA '86 specifically indicates that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discharge planning follows hospitalization. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of &sect;482.43 do not apply to patients who appear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a hospital emergency room but are not admitted as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospital inpatients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Three commenters thought we should require each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospital to have a policy for developing and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
utilizing screening criteria for identifying those patients 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whose medical conditions and social circumstances would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warrant discharge planning and to require that the hospital 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review its criteria annually. As an alternative, they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested that hospitals be required to have a procedure for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identifying at an early stage patients likely to need 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
post-acute care services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We believe the use of an outcome oriented 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard is sufficient for the regulation and in accord with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the basic approach used in the June 17, 1986 revision to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions of participation for hospitals (51 FR 22042). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hospitals will be able to choose from many methods to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate compliance with the standard, and we wish to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preserve their flexibility in this regard, including the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
option of reviewing all Medicare patients admitted to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility. An on-going reassessment of the hospital's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discharge planning process, which would include any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
screening or identification methods, is required in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;482.43(e). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter wanted us to establish specified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria (e.g., age, functional ability, psychosocial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors and health status), to identify patients who are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likely to suffer adverse health consequences without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discharge planning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As mentioned in response to the previous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment, we want to continue the approach used in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
June 17, 1986 revision to the conditions of participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for hospitals, which avoided prescriptive administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements through the use of language that is stated in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terms of expected outcomes, thereby providing hospitals with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater flexibility. Since the criteria suggested by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter are overly prescriptive and not outcome oriented, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we are not adopting them.

 One commenter suggested that we have as an

alternative to the phrase ``patients who are likely to suffer

adverse health consequences,'' ``patients who are likely to be

Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We do not believe it is necessary to add this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
category of patients because it is subsumed in the original 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
category: someone unable to perform activities of daily

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two commenters thought that, if there is no

 We do not believe it is necessary to specify in

 One commenter believed there should be a

mandatory written form for the evaluation, preferably in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
form of a check-off list. The commenter also thought this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation form should include specified factors, such as

social needs and capacity for self-care.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 At the present time, a nationally used and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accepted form for all hospitals does not exist. Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9305(h) of OBRA '86 requires the Secretary to develop 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uniform needs assessment instrument(s) in consultation with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a panel of experts and to submit a report to Congress, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
makes recommendations for the appropriate use of this

 One commenter wanted us to clarify whether the

patient could request the development and initiation of a

discharge planning evaluation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As stated in &sect;482.43(b)(1), a physician or a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
patient (or patient's representative) may request a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discharge planning evaluation.

 One commenter thought the patient's physician 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should explicitly be included in the definition of patient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The statute uses the term ``patient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative'' in addition to references to the patient's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physician, and thus we conclude that the term was not meant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to include physicians. A physician's role is defined by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other Federal requirements such as those found in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;482.12(c), the condition of participation on the governing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
body concerning care of patients. Not including the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
patient's physician as his representative was not intended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to limit or eliminate the role of the physician in decisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about a patient's medical care, including the setting in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the care is provided, nor was it meant to imply that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the physician does not serve the patient's interest.

qualified personnel who develop or supervise the development 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the evaluation and discharge plan. We also received two

 Four commenters remarked about the provision to

allow ``other appropriately qualified personnel'' to develop 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or supervise the development of the evaluation and discharge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan. One commenter thought we should omit ``other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 It is our policy to avoid specifying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credentials in the conditions of participation wherever 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible. Such requirements could inappropriately restrict 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospital selection of staff, may superimpose the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of private groups over State law, and do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessarily ensure the provision of quality care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe that including the criteria in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interpretive guidelines will assure that minimum standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are met while allowing State surveyors to monitor the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement. In the future we will reevaluate the

have difficulty obtaining and retaining qualified personnel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters believed this provision dilutes the statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter suggested that as an alternative we add

appropriateness. We agree with the commenters that, in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present circumstances, the parenthetical phrase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inadvertently dilutes the statute. We are not accepting the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
second comment as to do so would be superfluous; the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition of participation for the hospital's governing body 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
already contains a standard at &sect;482.12(e) for all contracted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services. The hospital's governing body must ensure that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contractor for services (including one for shared services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and joint ventures) furnishes services that permit the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 To accept this comment would conflict with the statute, which places ``other appropriate qualified personnel''
as equals in qualifications of registered nurses and social workers. Indeed, these personnel may be more suited for
discharge planning by virtue of credentials or training and in some cases, such as in a rural hospital, it may be a physician
who does the discharge planning. We would like to note that in any event it is a management function of the hospital to
assure proper supervision of its employees and we do not wish to interfere with this function.

Medicare beneficiaries have the freedom to choose the vendor for post-hospital care.

 Section 1802 of the Social Security Act guarantees free choice by Medicare patients. It provides that any individual
entitled to Medicare may obtain health services from any institution, agency, or person qualified to participate
under the Medicare law if the institution, agency, or person undertakes to provide him or her those services. We do
not believe it is necessary to reaffirm this requirement in the standard for discharge planning evaluation. There
is nothing in this rule that prevents a Medicare beneficiary from exercising freedom of choice of a post-hospital
vendor of services.

 We do not believe that this specificity is needed in the regulation. Our approach is consistent with that used in the
June 17, 1986 regulatory revision to the conditions of participation for hospitals, which avoided prescriptive
administrative requirements and use of specific details. Although the factors mentioned by the commenter are relevant,
it is not our intention to create an ``all-inclusive'' list in the regulation. We will consider these, as well as other
factors, when formulating interpretive guidelines.

 We believe the current language of the final regulation, which is stated in terms of expected outcomes, provides hospitals
with sufficient flexibility and is in accord with the philosophy of the June 17, 1986 revision to the conditions of
participation for hospitals. We do not

agree that the degree of specificity desired by the commenter is needed in the regulation. His comments will, however,
be considered for inclusion in the interpretive guidelines.

 Three commenters addressed the inclusion of &sect;482.43(b)(4), which requires an evaluation of the patient's
capacity for self-care or of the possibility of the patient being cared for in the environment from which he or she entered
the hospital. Two commenters believed paragraph (b)(4) to be a positive addition and supported inclusion of this
element in the evaluation. The third commenter stated that &sect;482.43 (b)(3) and (b)(4) are duplicative.

 We disagree with the third commenter. The intent of the two paragraphs is as follows: &sect;483.43(b)(3) reproduces
the statutory provision, while (b)(4) specifies an element that must be included in the evaluation that is not necessarily
apparent from the text of the statute.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter believed that we should require that more than a patient's capacity for self-care be considered. The
commenter urged that we consider the patient's wishes as well, as some persons with limited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capacity for self-care may be cared for at home. Also, the commenter indicated that emphasis on capacity for self-care
can lead to an overemphasis on care in a skilled nursing facility (SNF) rather than by a home health agency (HHA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The patient's wishes are an integral aspect of the capacity for self-care, since the capacity includes not only the
patient's ability for self-care, but also the willingness for such care. There are a variety of services that are provided
equally well by both SNFs and HHAs. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination of which provider is appropriate depends necessarily on other conditions such as ability, availability,
and willingness of caregivers, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
availability of resources in the community, and patient preference. All these factors need to be considered.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter believed we should emphasize that the hospital should give each beneficiary the full range of options
to consider for post-hospital care rather than focusing on returning him or her to his or her prehospitalization environment,
particularly when the prehospitalization environment is an SNF. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In most instances the focus on a return to the prehospitalization environment is a valid one, serving the interests
of the patient within available community resources. Alternatively, the regulations call for an assessment of the
patient's ability for self-care. We do not believe these alternative elements of the evaluation preclude a patient
from being offered a full range of options to consider for post-hospital care and we see no need to change the regulation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To allay the commenter's concern, however, we will include a statement in the interpretive guidelines to assure that
patients admitted to a hospital from an SNF are not shortchanged by the hospital discharge planning process. We 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would like to point out that sometimes a patient's expectations of where he or she wants to go after hospital discharge
(e.g., a return to the patient's former residence rather than to the SNF from which he or she was admitted) are not realistic
due to the patient's physical or mental condition, available community resources, or any one or more of these three.

 The purpose of the legislation is to assure that patients receive any necessary discharge planning, not to ensure
that a hospital develops a discharge plan only upon a physician's request. We agree that the physician is important
to the discharge plan, and we included a provision to require a hospital to develop a discharge plan if a physician requests
one, even if the hospital had determined one to be unnecessary. This provision, based on the statute, gives the physician
the final decision as to whether a discharge plan is necessary but does not unnecessarily require his input on a routine
basis.

 Four commenters remarked about the use of the word ``assist'' in &sect;482.43(c)(3), which requires the hospital
to ``assist in implementing the *&blank;*&blank;* discharge plan.'' One commenter liked the word ``assist'' as
it requires the hospital to become involved without placing the entire responsibility on the hospital. Two commenters
objected to the word as it is vague and passive; the statute requires the hospital to be the initiator of discharge planning.
The fourth commenter thought the provision required the hospital to implement the discharge plan.

 We do not believe it desirable to specify a single format and content for a discharge plan. Discharge planning is a discipline
with competing theories and practices, each of which likely carries with it unique 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documentation procedures and formats. We believe the hospital should retain flexibility in deciding the plan's
format and content. As our experience with this requirement develops and as needed, we will develop and revise interpretive
guidelines for survey personnel to assist them in assessing the sufficiency of an acceptable discharge plan.

 It is the hospital's responsibility to assure there is a mechanism for handling discharge planning complaints and

 We do not believe that establishing a specific time before discharge by which a discharge plan must be furnished would
be useful. In some difficult situations, the plan may not be ready until shortly before the patient is discharged;
having the plan ready too long before discharge does not allow for changing circumstances.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The State surveyors, in determining compliance with this condition, will look at whether the hospital developed
discharge plans for patients who needed them and whether the hospital arranged for its initial implementation. The
hospital will be expected to be able to document its decision about the need for a plan, document the existence of plans
where they are needed and show what steps it took to implement those plans initially. In our view, the hospital has the
latitude to accomplish this result in the most efficient way possible. We do not believe that the discharge plan, which
may contain information already in the medical record in the form of clinical notes, for example, is always an essential
part of the patient's formal medical record. We recognize that the JCAHO requires that the discharge plan be entered
into the medical record, and that many hospitals may do it, but we do not believe that making this mandatory in all cases
would serve a useful purpose.

Several commenters remarked about the requirement in &sect;482.43(c)(4) concerning periodic reassessment; one
commenter thought that the reassessment should be based on changes in the patient's condition or progress. Another
commenter wanted to know how the periodic reassessment differs from an assessment on an as-needed basis. The third
commenter believed that the requirement, as written, could apply after discharge and the regulation needs to specify
that the reassessment occurs before discharge.

 We are modifying proposed &sect;482.43(c)(4) to require reassessments on an as-needed basis, based on factors that
may affect continuing care needs or the appropriateness of the discharge plan. We do not agree that the regulation
needs to specify that the reassessment must be done before discharge. The duty for discharge planning ends after discharge,
assuming the hospital has arranged for the initial implementation of the Medicare patient's discharge plans in accordance
with &sect;482.43(c)(3) and has transferred or referred the patient in accordance with &sect;482.43(d).

 One commenter wanted us to specify predetermined times at which the patient and family must be counseled to prepare
for post-hospital care, rather than requiring this counseling on an as-needed basis.

 We do not agree that we should be so specific. Hospital personnel are in the best position to judge the best times to counsel
the patient and family and to accommodate individual situations.

 One commenter thought we should avoid over-utilization of family caregiving systems and use more non-family-based
community resources.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Use of family caregivers occurs in discharge planning only when the family is both willing 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 able to perform needed services. In the absence of such a commitment, it is appropriate to use community resources
that are not family-based.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter thought there is a need for greater identification of the caregiver in the discharge planning process;
in each case, the commenter suggested, we should require the hospital to determine whether there is a caregiver, the
caregiver's willingness and ability to provide care, and mechanisms for preparing families to provide the care.
Another commenter, on the other hand, expressed concern that the regulation text inappropriately advocates the
use of family caregivers in situations where community-based services are available and that we are not providing
the patient his or her choice in such situations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We agree that identification of family or other caregiver is a key attribute of effective discharge planning and believe
that our regulations at 42 CFR 482.43(b)(3), (b)(4), (b)(6) and (c)(5) both appropriately and in a balanced manner
relate to this need.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

provision of specialized instruction or training in post-hospital care.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We received four comments on our requirement that a hospital must discharge or transfer the patient after executing
a discharge plan. One commenter thought we were going beyond the intent of the statute and that few hospitals have the
authority to transfer or refer patients; one thought our statement that the statute did not require discharge or transfer
to be misleading; and two commenters were in favor of the provision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 While it is true that the statute does not explicitly require the hospital to follow through and actually discharge
or transfer the patient, we believe the requirement is implicit in the purpose of the legislation: to assure that patients
receive proper post-hospital care. This requirement, as with other conditions of participation, must operate within
the constraints of a hospital's authority under State law and within the limits of a patient's right to refuse discharge
planning services. As we stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, the proposed requirement is 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 new and has been in place for some time.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter remarked that we should strengthen the regulation by requiring hospital discharge planning personnel
to maintain complete and accurate information on community long-term care services and facilities for advising
patients and their representatives of their options.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We do not believe a change in the regulation is warranted. The current outcome-oriented standard is sufficient and
in accord with the regulatory approach used in the June 17, 1986 revision to the conditions of participation for hospitals.
Hospitals will be able to choose from many methods to demonstrate compliance with the standard. We will incorporate
the commenter's suggested language in the interpretive guidelines for the standard and for the on-going reassessment
of the hospital's discharge planning process required in &sect;482.43(e).

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter questioned whether &sect;482.43(d), which requires the hospital to transfer necessary medical information
along with the patient for post-hospital services, is compatible with &sect;482.24(b)(3), which requires release
of information only to authorized individuals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 42 CFR 482.24(b)(3) requires that the hospital have a procedure for insuring confidentiality of patient records.
Information from or copies of records must be released only to authorized individuals and the hospital must ensure
that unauthorized individuals cannot gain access to or alter patient records. Original medical records must be released
by the hospital only in accordance with Federal or State laws, court orders, or subpoenas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since proposed &sect;482.43(d) has been in effect as &sect;482.21(b)(2) (beginning September 15, 1986), there
has been no conflict with &sect;482.24(b)(3) and we do not anticipate any problems when &sect;482.43(d) becomes
effective as a final rule. ``Necessary medical information'' has not been interpreted in our guidelines as requiring
transmission of the patient's medical record.

to send to it.

 ``Appropriate facilities'' refers to facilities that can meet the patient's medical needs on a post-discharge basis.
Our interpretive guidelines for &sect;482.21(b)(2) give as examples of ``necessary'' information: functional
capacity of an individual, the nursing and other care requirements of the patient, discharge summary, and referral
forms.

 These are typical overhead costs of Medicare hospital operations that are allocated to the appropriate cost center
and that are already taken into account as part of the cost base used to develop payment rates under the prospective
payment system (PPS). Therefore, the PPS payment rates already reflect these costs and no additional payment by either
Medicare or the beneficiary is needed.

 If the information is governed by &sect;482.24(b)(3), which concerns medical record services, it is subject to the
safeguards of that provision. This provision requires that medical information be released only to authorized individuals
and that the hospital ensure that unauthorized individuals cannot gain access to or alter patient records. Otherwise
the release of the information is governed by any other Federal law, State law or hospital policy, which may require
a patient's written authorization before release of information.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter requested that we define ``appropriate facility'' as one that (a) is able to provide needed care in a
manner that complies with Federal and State standards; (b) participates in payment programs that are needed to pay
for the beneficiary's care; and (c) is within a reasonable distance of the beneficiary's home so that relatives and
friends may visit. Such a definition, the commenter suggested, would establish reasonable guidelines consistent
with current HCFA policies and Congressional intent.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The term ``appropriate facility'' has been utilized in present 42 CFR 482.21(b)(2) since September 15, 1986 without
further definition and has not presented an implementation problem. Therefore, we do not believe we need a more specific
definition in this regulation. Our interpretive guidelines for &sect;482.21(b)(2) currently define ``appropriate
facilities'' as facilities that can meet the patient's medical needs on a post-discharge basis. We will consider
the commenter's suggested factors, and others, when drafting implementing guidelines for &sect;482.43(d).

 One commenter thought we should reinforce the requirement in &sect;482.43(e) that a hospital reassess its discharge
planning process on an on-going basis; the reinforcement would be a requirement that a hospital document its discharge
planning process, the procedure and the results of the reassessment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As stated in response to comments on the general opening statement in &sect;482.43, we are requiring that the hospital
have written policies and procedures for its entire discharge planning process, which will include its reassessment.
A specific documentation requirement for &sect;482.43(e) is not needed since it is subsumed by our revision of the
general opening statement in &sect;482.43. We will also reinforce the need for documentation of &sect;482.43(e)
in our interpretive guidelines.

 One commenter believed it would be helpful if the new hospital condition of participation for discharge planning
had built into it measures or parameters for ascertaining when additional discharge planning features and responsibilities
should be added.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Although we do not agree that such measures or parameters should be specified in the regulation at this time, or that
they could be all inclusive, we do believe it is appropriate to mention some factors suggested by commenters to the
regulations that will be included in the interpretive guidelines for &sect;482.43(e). The guidelines will include
assuring_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The effectiveness of the identification criteria; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The quality and timeliness for discharge planning evaluations and discharge plans; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) That the hospital discharge personnel maintain complete and accurate information on community long-term care
services and facilities and use this information to advise patients and their representatives of appropriate options;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) That the hospital has a coordinated discharge planning process that integrates discharge planning with other
functional departments, including the quality assurance and utilization review activities of the institution,
and involves the various disciplines responsible for patient care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, in reviewing this and other comments, we believe &sect;482.43(e) can be strengthened by clarifying that, although
a review of discharge plans must be part of the reassessment requirement, we are not restricting a hospital to that
mechanism alone. For example, a hospital might wish to review a sample of patients who were not identified as likely
to suffer adverse health consequences upon discharge if there was no adequate discharge planning as a means to reassess
the effectiveness of their identification criteria. This clarification of the regulation will remove an unnecessary
restriction on the means used to accomplish reassessment and increase hospital flexibility in meeting the reassessment
standard. Section 482.43(e) is revised to read:

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter thought it unfortunate that the two interrelated processes (the development of uniform needs assessment
instruments and discharge planning) have been separated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Although these two statutory provisions both appear in section 9305 of OBRA '86, they are separate provisions (section
9305(c) is the hospital discharge planning process and section 9305(h) is the development of uniform needs assessment
instrument(s)) with different implementation requirements. The legislation does not specify that implementation
of the hospital discharge planning process is contingent upon development of a uniform needs assessment instrument.
Further, implementation of the hospital discharge planning process requires regulations only while section 9305(h)
required the appointment of and public hearings by a Secretary's Advisory Panel on the Development of Uniform Needs
Assessment Instrument(s), which was to send a report to Congress with its recommendations. The 18-member panel completed
its work, and the recommendations were forwarded to Congress in a report on June 30, 1992. The recommendations to Congress
include recognition of the need for field testing and possible further refinement of the uniform needs assessment
instrument before adoption. Certainly, patients have a current need for an expanded discharge planning process
under the hospital conditions of participation and we do not believe an additional delay of this rule would serve a
useful purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter may be assured that, although these are separate statutory provisions with separate implementation
requirements, HCFA has and will continue to coordinate these two activities. The discharge planning process has
been structured so that any future instrument requirements can be incorporated by regulation into the discharge
planning requirements. Similarly, the Advisory Panel drafted the framework of the uniform needs assessment instrument
that they believe is compatible with this rule on discharge planning. It is premature, however, to include a requirement
for usage of the instrument in the condition of participation before the instrument's utility is evaluated through
field testing.

 We believe it is best left to the hospital and physician to handle these disputes within the limits of an applicable
State statute. It would be very difficult for us to draft guidelines that are flexible enough to allow all appropriate
hospital procedures to be approved and, since the Federal interest is in the result rather than the process, we elected
to leave this to hospital discretion.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We received comments from three entities concerning the ``Important Message from Medicare.'' All three thought
the Message to be inadequate for purposes of informing patients of discharge planning. One commenter believed the
Message should have been released at a time that did not preclude public input on the contents of the revised Message
concerning discharge planning. Another commenter thought that patients should, in addition to written notification,
be informed orally of their discharge planning rights. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The statute does not require notice to patients concerning their right to discharge planning. It does require unconditionally
that the hospital provide the service when needed. Moreover, we do not agree that the Message is inadequate for bringing
discharge planning to the attention of patients or their representatives. Although it does not contain the specifics
of the proposed rule as one commenter recommended, its purpose is to emphasize the availability of discharge planning
and the need to consult one's physician or appropriate hospital staff for assistance. To add more detail would, we
believe, add confusion; the Message is already full of other important information and could become overwhelming.

 There is a need, recognized by Congress, to provide for sufficient flexibility in the requirements for them to be applied
to both small rural facilities and complex urban hospital centers. This approach is also consistent with the focus
of the June 17, 1986 revision of the conditions of participation for hospitals, which eliminated unnecessary regulations
and replaced specific details on maintaining adequate and safe facilities with general comprehensive statements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We will implement this regulation through interpretive guidelines, which are the survey tools used by surveyors
to determine Federal compliance with the regulation. These guidelines will contain a degree of specificity and clarification
that is impractical and unwarranted for inclusion in the Federal regulation.

 Two commenters thought we should adopt the more detailed and strict discharge planning requirements of a particular
State or locality in the regulations at 42 CFR 483.43. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 There is nothing in the regulations to prevent a hospital from complying with stricter State or local requirements.
In fact, our regulations at 42 CFR 482.11 would require such compliance. However, we believe that the statutory provision
on discharge planning, because it is so detailed, reflects the level of effort intended by the Congress to be required
by HCFA and so we do not believe it is appropriate to go beyond Federal statutory provisions.

 One commenter believed that the regulations should clearly state that if a patient does not want a discharge evaluation
or plan, his wishes should prevail over the hospital's need to comply with the condition of participation.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As with other services offered by hospitals, patients may refuse to accept discharge planning or to comply with a discharge
plan just as they may refuse medical treatment. When a patient exercises this choice, however, we suggest that the
hospitals document the patient's refusal. The interpretive guidelines will mention this type of situation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter believed the condition of participation for discharge planning needs to reflect more comprehensively
the purposes of discharge planning, among them_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) to ensure that patients are not discharged prematurely and to provide evidence on that point; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) to facilitate appropriate outplacement; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) to document the need for post-hospital care for purposes of prior concurrent authorization by fiscal intermediaries
to pay for such services; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) to document the need for administratively necessary days; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) to help ensure continuity of cases in a fragmented delivery system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As defined in the legislation, the purpose of the discharge planning process is to ensure a timely and smooth transition
to the most appropriate type and setting for post-hospital or rehabilitative care. The regulations include requirements
to achieve this result. We do not believe a more detailed discussion of its purpose would enhance its effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter believed that we should require that each hospital have an integrated discharge planning process.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Assuring that the process is complete and functions properly is a hospital's responsibility. The interpretive guidelines
for &sect;482.43(e) contain procedures for determining a hospital's success in meeting this requirement. We believe
that a separate regulatory requirement for ``coordination'' would be redundant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter thought we should include a requirement that discharge planning be placed within the hospital's social
services department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We do not agree. One of our stated objectives of the revised conditions of participation for hospitals, which became
effective September 15, 1986, was to permit maximum flexibility in hospital administration and they do not contain
a requirement for a social services department into which this requirement could be placed. We will continue to encourage
that flexibility in implementing the discharge planning requirement by not requiring that it be placed in a particular
hospital department.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter stated that there is a need for careful monitoring and vigorous enforcement of the discharge planning
process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We agree. As with the other conditions of participation, the new 42 CFR 482.43 will be monitored through the survey
and certification process. We will be developing detailed guidelines for our hospital surveyors to use in determining
whether the discharge planning process results in the development of appropriate plans; whether the individual
plans are adequate; and whether the plans are appropriately executed as required by this regulation.

V. Summary of Revisions to Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are adopting the proposed rule as final with the changes described above. These changes include the following:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 482.43, Introductory paragraph: We are revising this section to specify that the hospital discharge
planning condition of participation applies to all patients, and we are adding a requirement that the hospital must
specify its discharge planning policies and procedures in writing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 482.43 (b)(2) and (c)(1)_We are omitting the phrase ``(consistent with available community and hospital
resources).''

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Section 482.43(b)(5)_We are omitting the qualifier, ``, to the greatest extent possible,'' from the requirement
that appropriate arrangements be made before discharge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 482.43(c)(3)_We are requiring the hospital to arrange for the initial implementation of the discharge
plan rather than requiring that a hospital assist in implementing a discharge plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 482.43(c)(4)_We are requiring the hospital to reassess a patient's discharge plan if there are factors
that may affect continuing care needs or the appropriateness of the discharge plan, rather than requiring the proposed
periodic reassessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 482.43(e)_We are revising the proposed requirement that a hospital reassess its discharge planning
process by reviewing discharge plans to instead include review of the plans as part of the reassessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, as noted in section III. B of this preamble, we are not adopting the proposed changes in &sect;&sect;405.2135
and 405.2137 to the ESRD conditions for coverage.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1861(e)(3) of the Act requires a hospital participating in Medicare to have by-laws in effect concerning
its staff of physicians. The staff of physicians is also a matter of health and safety for the hospital's patients;
therefore, section 1861(e)(9) of the Act, which gives the Secretary the authority to promulgate health and safety
standards, serves as a basis for governing the appointment of a medical director. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Among the conditions of participation a hospital participating in Medicare must meet is one at &sect;482.22 concerning
medical staff. One of the standards, concerning medical staff organization and accountability (see &sect;482.22(b)(3)),
requires that the responsibility for the organization and conduct of the medical staff be assigned only to an individual
doctor of medicine or osteopathy. This person is the medical director. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 19, 1989, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (OBRA '89) (Pub. L. 101&hyph;239) was enacted.
Section 6025 of that law permits a Medicare-participating hospital the flexibility to consider and assign a doctor
of dental surgery or dental medicine when naming a medical director, if permitted by State law of the State in which
the hospital is located. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Revision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of section 6025 of OBRA '89, we are revising standard (b)(3), Medical staff organization and accountability,
of &sect;482.22, Condition of participation: Medical staff. We are requiring that the responsibility for organization
and conduct of the medical staff may be assigned only to an individual doctor of medicine or osteopathy, except when
State law of the State in which the hospital is located permits a hospital to have a doctor of dental surgery or dental
medicine as its medical director. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are revising our regulations to conform to the OBRA '89 provision. Doing so will give hospitals flexibility in some
States, eliminate conflicts between State and Federal laws in some instances, and acknowledge changing practices
in the delivery of medical care.

B. Accrediting Program Name Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The name of the entity accrediting programs for x-ray technologists in &sect;405.1413, Conditions for Coverage_qualifications,
orientation and health of technical personnel, paragraph (a)(1), has been changed from ``the Council on Medical
Education'' to ``the Committee on Allied Health Education and Accreditation.'' We are making the necessary conforming
change to our regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VII. Impact Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)
(5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies that a final rule will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, we treat all hospitals and ESRD facilities as small
entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We do not have the data to assess accurately the magnitude of the change in procedures that will result from the new condition
of participation on discharge planning. However, we believe that adequate planning is already done in most hospitals
for the following reasons: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The prospective payment system has created an incentive for hospitals to have good discharge planning procedures;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The conditions of participation have a standard requiring each hospital to do discharge planning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the absence of positive evidence to the contrary, we believe that this final rule will have little effect. We wish
to point out, however, that incorporating the statutory requirements as a condition, instead of a standard, could
result in graver consequences for those hospitals that do not engage in adequate planning in the event that a routine
or complaint survey establishes noncompliance. However, we do not expect this to happen often. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If it were correct to presume that a lack of planning leads to systematic underservice of beneficiary needs, then the
requirement for discharge planning, especially early assessment of the need for planning, should: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Ensure that needs are identified and appropriate transfers and referrals are made; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Result in some increase in health care utilization by patients who might otherwise not have received needed
care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We do not believe that all patients receive all needed care. However, factors other than the lack of planning affect
whether or not patients receive needed services. Even when planning is available, patients sometimes defer or avoid
recommended referrals or follow-up care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other provisions of this rule will have no significant effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have determined and the Secretary certifies that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on
a substantial number of small entities. We have therefore not prepared a regulatory flexibility analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1102(b) of the Social Security Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a final
rule may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Such an analysis
must conform to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small
rural hospital as a hospital that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are not preparing a rural impact statement since we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this final
rule will not have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 12866, this regulation was not reviewed by the Office of Management
and Budget.

VIII. Paperwork Reduction Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 482.43 of this rule contains information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collection requirements that are subject to the Office of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management and Budget (OMB) approval under the Paperwork

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting burden for the collections of information in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;482.43 is comparable to the burden for &sect;482.21(b), which it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replaces (and which is currently approved under OMB approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number 0938&hyph;0328).

IX. Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires us to publish a general notice of proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and afford prior public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment on proposed rules. Such notice includes a statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the time, place and nature of rulemaking proceedings, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference to the legal authority under which the rule is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule or a description of the subjects and issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involved. However, this requirement does not apply when the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency finds good cause that such a notice and comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedure is impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public interest, and incorporates its reasons in the rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issued. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have in this final rule published our intent to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conform our requirements on medical director qualifications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to those of section 6025 of Public Law 101&hyph;239 and to change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the name of an accrediting program. Since this final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
merely conforms our regulations regarding medical director 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualifications to the statute without interpretation, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the change of name of an accrediting program only amends the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations to reflect the new name, we believe it to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unnecessary and not in the public interest to publish a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule to obtain public comment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discharge planning. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The hospital must identify at an early 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stage of hospitalization all patients who are likely to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suffer adverse health consequences upon discharge if there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is no adequate discharge planning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Standard: Discharge planning evaluation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation to the patients identified in paragraph (a) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section, and to other patients upon the patient's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request, the request of a person acting on the patient's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
behalf, or the request of the physician. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A registered nurse, social worker, or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriately qualified personnel must develop, or supervise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the development of, the evaluation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation of the likelihood of a patient needing post- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospital services and of the availability of the services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The discharge planning evaluation must include an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation of the likelihood of a patient's capacity for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
self-care or of the possibility of the patient being cared 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for in the environment from which he or she entered the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospital. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The hospital personnel must complete the evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on a timely basis so that appropriate arrangements for post-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospital care are made before discharge, and to avoid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unnecessary delays in discharge.

appropriately qualified personnel must develop, or supervise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the development of, a discharge plan if the discharge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
planning evaluation indicates a need for a discharge plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In the absence of a finding by the hospital that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
patient needs a discharge plan, the patient's physician may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request a discharge plan. In such a case, the hospital must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
develop a discharge plan for the patient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The hospital must arrange for the initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation of the patient's discharge plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan if there are factors that may affect continuing care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needs or the appropriateness of the discharge plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) As needed, the patient and family members or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interested persons must be counseled to prepare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the September 1, 1994 issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 45330), we published a final rule with comment period revising the Medicare hospital inpatient prospective
payment systems for operating costs and capital-related costs to implement necessary changes arising from our continuing
experience with the system. In the addendum to that final rule with comment period, we announced the prospective payment
rates for Medicare hospital inpatient services for operating costs and capital-related costs applicable to discharges
occurring on or after October 1, 1994, and set forth update factors for the rate-of-increase limits for hospitals
and hospital units excluded from the prospective payment systems. This notice corrects errors made in that document.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the September 1, 1994 final rule with comment period (59 FR 45330), we indicated that if a hospital believes its wage
index value is incorrect as a result of an intermediary or HCFA error, the hospital must notify HCFA no later than September
23, 1994. As a result of this process, we have identified several corrections to the wage data. Accordingly, the wage
index values for several areas have been changed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule also contained other technical and typographical errors. The revised wage index values, and other
changes affecting prospective payment rates, reflect corrections that were made between publication of the FY 1995
prospective payment system final rule with comment period on September 1, 1994, and implementation of the FY 1995
prospective payment rates on October 1, 1994. Therefore, we are making the following corrections to the September
1, 1994 final rule with comment period:

Any request for reconsideration must be based upon knowledge of changed conditions, or upon new scientific or technical
data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The modifications are made pursuant to section 201 of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4105, and
are in accordance with the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. 4001 et seq., and with 44 CFR part 65. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For rating purposes, the currently effective community number is shown and must be used for all new policies and renewals.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The modified base (100-year) flood elevations are the basis for the floodplain management measures that the community
is required to either adopt or to show evidence of being already in effect in order to qualify or to remain qualified
for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These modified elevations, together with the floodplain management criteria required by 44 CFR 60.3, are the minimum
that are required. They should not be construed to mean that the community must change any existing ordinances that
are more stringent in their floodplain management requirements. The community may at any time enact stricter requirements
of its own, or pursuant to policies established by other Federal, state or regional entities.

are available for inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The modifications are made pursuant to section 206 of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4105, and

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This order revokes an Executive order insofar as it affects 15 acres of public land withdrawn for the Bureau of Land
Management's Phosphate Reserve No. 7. The land is no longer needed for the purpose for which it was withdrawn. The revocation

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission modifies its rules pertaining to three aspects of auction design for the broadband PCS auctions: Procedures
triggering the close of an auction, timing of the auctions for the entrepreneurs' blocks, and anti-collusion rules.
These actions are intended to speed the conclusion of the auctions, thus facilitating rapid introduction of service
to the public; to improve the administrative efficiency of the auction process; and to foster competition and widespread
participation in the auctions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. By this action, we reconsider, on our own motion, decisions made in the Fourth Memorandum Opinion and Order in this
proceeding, which addressed petitions for reconsideration of the Fifth Report and Order concerning auction design
and procedures for the auction of licenses to provide personal communications services in the 2 GHz band (``broadband
PCS'').
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 In light of our experience in the national and regional narrowband PCS license auctions, we find it desirable to modify
our rules pertaining to three aspects of auction design for the broadband PCS auctions: procedures triggering the
close of an auction, timing of the auctions for the entrepreneurs' blocks, and anti-collusion rules.

II. Stopping Rules
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. In the Fifth Report and Order we stated that a simultaneous multiple round auction with a simultaneous stopping
rule will close when a single round has passed in which there is no new acceptable bid on any license and no activity rule
waiver is submitted.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 In the Fourth Memorandum Opinion and Order we allowed for two types of activity rule waivers, ``proactive'' waivers,
which will keep an auction open in a round in which no new valid bids are submitted, and ``automatic'' waivers, which
will not keep an auction open.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 We also reaffirmed our decision to use a simultaneous stopping rule, which holds bidding open on all licenses until
no new acceptable bid is offered on any license.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 These same rules were applied in the regional and national narrowband auctions. The nationwide narrowband PCS auction
(with 10 licenses) was completed after 47 rounds of bidding, and the regional narrowband PCS auction (with 30 licenses)
took 105 rounds to complete. In the broadband PCS auctions 99 MTA licenses will be auctioned in the first auction and
a total of 1,972 BTA licenses in subsequent auctions. Although the number of rounds to complete a simultaneous multiple
round auction is not necessarily directly proportional to the number of licenses put up for bid, we are concerned that,
without changes in procedures, it may take an excessively long period of time to conduct these auctions, thus creating
a significant delay in providing service to the public.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 Thus our recent experience with simultaneous multiple round auctions suggests that the Commission should consider
additional measures to ensure that future auctions are completed within a reasonable period of time.

3. We believe that retaining the discretion to keep an auction open even if no new acceptable bids and no proactive waivers
are submitted will allow the Commission to complete the broadband PCS auctions in a timely manner without sacrificing
efficiency or revenue. Providing the auction staff with the discretion to keep an auction open will permit the Commission
to use larger minimum bid increments early in the auction (to move the auction along quickly) without incurring the
risk that the auction will close while some bidders are willing to pay significantly more for certain licenses than
the current high bid but not more than the relatively large minimum bid increments. The Commission will be able to permit
additional bidding at lower bid increments subsequent to a round with no bids, thereby increasing the likelihood
that licenses will be awarded to the bidders that value them most highly and facilitating efficient aggregations
of licenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Retaining the discretion to keep an auction open will also allow the Commission to continue to accept bids on a license
for which a bid was withdrawn late in an auction, especially in the last round of an auction. Without the option of keeping
an auction open, a license for which a bid was withdrawn in the last round would have to be put up for bid in a subsequent
auction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Accordingly, we retain the discretion to keep an auction open even if no new acceptable bids and no proactive waivers
are submitted in a single round. Under this minor modification of our procedures, the Commission would in essence
have the ability to submit its own proactive waiver, thus keeping the auction open. This rule modification will facilitate
the rapid completion of future auctions because it will permit the Commission to use larger bid increments, which
speed the pace of the auction, without risking a premature auction close.

6. In the Fifth Report and Order, the Commission chose to divide broadband PCS licenses into three groups and to hold
a simultaneous multiple round auction for the licenses in each group. The license group to be auctioned first consisted
of blocks A and B, each with 30 MHz of spectrum and MTA geographic scope. The next group consisted of blocks C and F (the
entrepreneurs' blocks), which have been reserved for bidding by smaller entrepreneurial firms. The group to be auctioned
last consisted of blocks D and E, with 10 MHz of spectrum each and BTA geographic scope.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 We concluded that in order to promote efficient license allocation, highly interdependent licenses should be grouped
together and put up for bid at the same time in a multiple round auction. Doing so, we concluded, would provide bidders
information about the prices of complementary and substitutable licenses while such licenses were still up for bid,
and thus would facilitate awarding licenses to the bidders who value them most highly. Nevertheless, we noted that
the cost and complexity of auctioning a very large number of interdependent licenses simultaneously might outweigh
the informational and bidding flexibility advantages.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 In the Fourth Memorandum Opinion and Order we reaffirmed our decision concerning the sequence of auctions.

7. We now believe that we may wish to hold two separate auctions for the C and F block licenses.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 In light of our experience with the narrowband auctions, we are concerned that auctioning simultaneously the 986
licenses in the two entrepreneurs' blocks may create excessive administrative complexity for the Commission and
for bidders, particularly when neither will have had experience with more than 99 licenses in a single auction. In
addition, we have found that as we gain experience with license auctions we identify certain modifications that are
necessary to improve the efficiency and administration of the auction process. We may wish to benefit from such experience
in administering the highly complex designated entity provisions that apply to competitive bidding for licenses
on the C and F blocks. Further, it appears now that few, if any, potential applicants have any interest in aggregating
block C and block F licenses, so that the interdependence between license values in the two blocks may be less than we
initially believed. Consequently, we reserve the discretion to hold two separate simultaneous multiple round auctions
for the entrepreneurs' block licenses, one auction for block C and one for block F. We will announce by Public Notice
in advance of the application deadline whether one or two entrepreneurs' block auctions will be held and the date of
those auctions.

8. We have become aware of some confusion regarding the definition of the terms ``applicant'' and ``bidder'' as they
are used in our anti-collusion rules, and we wish to clarify our rules on this issue.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 Section 1.2105(c)(1) of the Commission's Rules prohibits ``bidders'' from cooperating, collaborating, discussing
or disclosing in any manner the substance of their bids or bidding strategies, but &sect;1.2105(c)(2) and (3) provide
exceptions to this rule so as to allow ``applicants'' to make changes in ownership that do not result in a change in control
of the applicant, or to bid jointly with other applicants, as long as they have not applied for licenses in any of the
same geographic license areas.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 Though we intended the terms ``bidder'' and ``applicant'' to be used interchangeably, we now recognize that it would
be less confusing simply to use the term ``applicant,'' and we are amending the rules accordingly.

9. In addition, it has been suggested that &sect;1.2105(c)(1) of our rules should be interpreted to mean that parties
holding attributable interests in bidders are not prohibited from engaging in the discussions addressed in that
section.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 We wish to make clear that this interpretation is an incorrect reading of our rules. For purposes of our anti-collusion
rules, therefore, we clarify that the term ``applicant'' will include all holders of attributable interests in an
applicant. For this purpose, ``attributable interest'' shall have the same definition as that used in &sect;24.204(d)(2)(i)
of our Rules for purposes of defining interests subject to the spectrum aggregation limits: ``[p]artnership and
other ownership interests and any stock interest amounting to 5 percent of more of the equity, or outstanding stock,
or outstanding voting stock of a broadband PCS licensee or applicant will be attributable.''
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 In addition ``[o]fficers and directors of a broadband PCS licensee or applicant *&blank;*&blank;* shall be considered
to have an attributable interest in the entity with which they are so associated.''
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 This is entirely consistent with the intent of the anti-collusion rules. Indeed, if holders of attributable interests
were not considered applicants, collusive arrangements would be possible simply through the creation of a separate
entity to act as the ``applicant.'' Further, this clarification conforms with other Commission rules regarding
the competitive bidding process. For example, &sect;24.813(a) requires parties applying to participate in broadband
PCS auctions to provide, among other things, information with respect to ``any person holding five percent or more
of each class of stock, warrants, options or debt securities *&blank;*&blank;*.''

10. We believe, however, that allowing holders of non-controlling attributable interests in an applicant greater
flexibility to form agreements with other applicants may enable applicants to acquire the capital necessary to bid
successfully for licenses. Our anti-collusion rules are intended to protect the integrity and robustness of our
competitive bidding process. In pursuit of that goal, however, we do not wish to restrict unreasonably the formation
of non-collusive bidding consortia. For example, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fourth Memorandum Opinion and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
we added to our Rules &sect;24.833, which provides that parties that after the auction hold non-controlling ownership
interests in more PCS spectrum than a single entity is entitled to hold may divest sufficient properties to come into
compliance with the spectrum aggregation limits.
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 Section 24.833 clearly contemplates entities holding ownership interests in two applicants for licenses in the
same markets. Nevertheless, when one entity holds an attributable interest in more than one applicant for licenses
in the same geographic license area, the potential for collusion is present because of the opportunity for the common
owner to influence the bidding of the applicants. Thus, our rules permit applicants to change their ownership, enter
into joint bidding arrangements and form consortia after the filing of short-form applications only if the parties
to such arrangements have not applied for licenses in any of the same geographic areas.

11. We believe that so long as collusive conduct can be reliably prevented, the public interest favors allowing holders
of non-controlling attributable interests in one applicant for a particular license to obtain ownership interests
in or enter into consortium arrangements with a second applicant for licenses in the same geographic area(s). Accordingly,
we will amend the anti-collusion rules to permit a holder of non-controlling attributable interests in an applicant
to obtain an ownership interest in or enter into a consortium arrangement with another applicant for a license in the
same geographic area, provided that the attributable interest holder certifies to the Commission that it has observed
and will observe certain restrictions on communication concerning the applicants in which it holds an attributable
interest or with which it has entered into a consortium arrangement. The attributable interest holder must certify
that it has not communicated and will not communicate, with the applicant or anyone else, concerning the bids or bidding
strategies (including which licenses an applicant will or will not bid on) of more than one applicant for licenses
in the same geographic area in which it holds an ownership interest or with which it has a consortium arrangement. As
described above, ``applicant'' for this purpose includes all holders of attributable interests in an applicant.
Thus, if the attributable interest holder has discussed the bidding strategy of the applicant in which it holds an
attributable interest (Company A), or of any other entity that also holds an attributable interest in Company A, the
attributable interest holder may not acquire an attributable interest in another applicant for a license in a geographic
area in which Company A (or any other attributable interest holder in Company A) has applied for a license unless it
certifies that it has not communicated concerning the bids or bidding strategies of the applicant in which it wishes
to acquire an attributable interest.

12. We believe that this revision will facilitate the flow of capital to applicants by enabling parties to make investments
in multiple applicants for licenses in the same geographic license areas while ensuring that these investments will
not lead to collusion among bidders. We recognize that some potential for collusion exists whenever an entity is permitted
to hold an interest in more than one applicant for licenses in the same geographic license area. We expect that the certification
requirement will adequately prevent collusion from occurring. However, we intend to scrutinize carefully any instances
in which bidding patterns suggest that collusion may be occurring, and we wish to emphasize that all applicants and
their owners continue to be subject to existing antitrust laws. Applicants should note that conduct that is permissible
under the Commission's Rules may be prohibited by the antitrust laws.
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 Thus, applicants should proceed with extreme caution in situations involving consortia and joint bidding arrangements.
We also wish to make clear that communications concerning bids and bidding strategies may include communications
regarding capital calls or requests for additional funds in support of bids or bidding strategies to the extent such
communications convey information concerning the bids and bidding strategies directly or indirectly. If applicants
enter into new or modified consortia or bidding arrangements, or if changes are made in an applicant's ownership,
the applicants must timely modify their short-form applications to reflect these changes.

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), we conclude that ``good cause'' exists to have the rule changes take effect immediately
because a delay would not provide applicants with sufficient time to finalize their bidding strategies and business
plans for the upcoming broadband PCS auctions. Immediate implementation of the rule changes set forth herein also
provides applicants with the required certainty to proceed with their bidding and business strategies, alleviating
concerns that last-minute modifications to our rules would impede the success of their auction plan. See 5 U.S.C.

(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3) and (c)(4) of this section, after the filing of short-form applications,
all applicants are prohibited from cooperating, collaborating, discussing or disclosing in any manner the substance
of their bids or bidding strategies, or discussing or negotiating settlement agreements, with other applicants
until after the high bidder makes the required down payment, unless such applicants are members of a bidding consortium
or other joint bidding arrangement identified on the bidder's short-form application pursuant to &sect;1.2105(a)(2)(viii).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Applicants may modify their short-form applications to reflect formation of consortia or changes in ownership
at any time before or during an auction, provided such changes do not result in a change in control of the applicant,
and provided that the parties forming consortia or entering into ownership agreements have not applied for licenses
in any of the same geographic license areas. Such changes will not be considered major modifications of the application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) After the filing of short-form applications, applicants may make agreements to bid jointly for licenses, provided
the parties to the agreement have not applied for licenses in any of the same geographic license areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) After the filing of short-form applications, a holder of a non-controlling attributable interest in an entity
submitting a short-form application may acquire an ownership interest in, form a consortium with, or enter into a
joint bidding arrangement with, other applicants for licenses in the same geographic license area, provided that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The attributable interest holder certifies to the Commission that it has not communicated and will not communicate
with any party concerning the bids or bidding strategies of more than one of the applicants in which it holds an attributable
interest, or with which it has a consortium or joint bidding arrangement, and which have applied for licenses in the
same geographic license area(s); and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The arrangements do not result in any change in control of an applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Applicants must modify their short-form applications to reflect any changes in ownership or in the membership
of consortia or joint bidding arrangements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) For purposes of this paragraph:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The term ``applicant'' shall include the entity submitting a short-form application to participate in an auction
(FCC Form 175), as well as all holders of partnership and other ownership interests and any stock interest amounting
to 5 percent or more of the entity, or outstanding stock, or outstanding voting stock of the entity submitting a short-form
application, and all officers and directors of that entity; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Title 49 U.S.C. 10118 and 10120 provide the Secretary of Transportation with authority to exempt a manufacturer from
any responsibility to notify or to remedy any defect or failure to comply upon a determination that such defect or failure
to comply is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety. This authority has been delegated to the Administrator
of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) as part of the Secretary's general delegation to administer
the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (49 CFR 1.50). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations implementing 49 U.S.C. 10118 and 10120 (at that time 15 U.S.C. 1417) were issued in 1977: 49 CFR part 556

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Exemption for Inconsequential Defect or Noncompliance
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. NHTSA Order 800&hyph;2 (November 20, 1978) established the agency's ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Procedures for Processing Petitions for Inconsequential Defect or Noncompliance
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
'', and assigned the Office of Rulemaking the primary responsibility for processing inconsequentiality petitions.
Part 566 is silent as to signatory authority for inconsequential notices. Under Order 800&hyph;2, ``the Decision
Package is submitted to the Administrator for approval and signature.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In practice, determinations of grant or denial have been signed by the Associate Administrator for Rulemaking after
approval by the Administrator. Thus, notwithstanding any formal delegation of power, the Administrator has made
a de facto delegation of such power. The agency is now amending Part 501 to make a de jure delegation of this power. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Forty-nine U.S.C. 10118 and 10120 are silent on whether a determination may be appealed. However, 49 CFR 556.7 expressly
permits any interested person to do so, and, under 49 CFR 556.8, ``the Administrator'' may grant or deny such appeals.
In practice, the same procedure has been followed with respect to the infrequent appeals from inconsequentiality
determinations. Because appeals are generally made to a higher authority than the decision maker, the Administrator
has decided to reserve this power, and Part 501 is amended to reflect this decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, NHTSA has noted that the titles of two Associate Administrators as set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations
lack the underlining accorded the other Associate Administrators in 49 CFR 501.8. NHTSA is amending these sections
to add the underlining for consistency of treatment.

This rulemaking has not been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. It has been determined that the rulemaking is not
significant under Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures. The purpose of the rule is to
clarify existing agency policy and procedures. Since the rule does not have any significant cost or other impacts,
preparation of a full regulatory evaluation is not warranted.

This final rule does not have any retroactive effect. Under 49 U.S.C. 30103 whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety
standard is in effect, a state may not adopt or maintain a safety standard applicable to the same aspect of performance
which is not identical to the Federal standard. Section 30161 of Title 49 sets forth a procedure for judicial review
of final rules establishing, amending or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards. That section does not
require submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before parties may file
suit in court.

I. Anti Car Theft Act of 1992 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ``Anti Car Theft Act of 1992'' (ACTA) amended the law relating to the labelling of major parts on high theft and other
motor vehicles that is now codified as 49 U.S.C. chapter 331 Theft Prevention. At 49 U.S.C. 33101(10), ``passenger
motor vehicle'' is defined to include ``a multipurpose passenger vehicle or light duty truck when that vehicle or
truck is rated at not more than 6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight.'' Since ``passenger motor vehicle'' was previously
defined to include passenger cars only, the effect of ACTA is that certain multipurpose passenger vehicle (MPV) and
light-duty truck (LDT) lines may be determined to be high theft vehicles, subject to the Motor Vehicle Theft Prevention
Standard (49 CFR part 541). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the Theft Prevention Standard is to reduce the incidence of motor vehicle theft by facilitating the
tracing and recovery of parts from stolen vehicles. The standard seeks to facilitate such tracing by requiring that
vehicle identification numbers (VINs), VIN derivative numbers, or other symbols be placed on major motor vehicle
parts. Each vehicle in a high theft line must have its major parts and major replacement parts marked unless the line
is exempted from parts marking pursuant to 49 CFR part 543. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To conform the Theft Prevention Standard to ACTA, NHTSA issued on July 7, 1993, an advance notice of proposed rulemaking
(ANPRM) (58 FR 36376). NHTSA sought comments on definitions of multipurpose passenger vehicles (MPVs) and light-duty
trucks (LDTs) for the Theft Prevention Standard, and on which parts of these vehicles should be considered major parts
and therefore subject to parts marking. After considering the public comments on the ANPRM, NHTSA published a notice
of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) on July 8, 1994 (59 FR 35082), to amend the Theft Prevention Standard. The issues that
were raised in the NPRM, and the public comments addressing them are discussed below.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Definitions of ``Light Duty Truck'' and ``Multipurpose Passenger Vehicle'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NPRM, NHTSA noted that since the statutory requirements for ``multipurpose passenger vehicles'' differ from
those for ``light duty trucks,'' these two terms must be clearly defined to make it possible to determine whether a
particular vehicle is an MPV or an LDT. Under ACTA, since NHTSA must require some MPV's with below-median theft rates
to be marked, but the Act exempts LDTs with below-median theft rates from coverage, NHTSA must ensure that a distinction
between LDTs and MPVs is made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ACTA limits ``multipurpose passenger vehicles'' to those vehicles rated at 6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight or
less. Thus, NHTSA's proposed definition of ``multipurpose passenger vehicle'' was:

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ACTA does not define ``light-duty truck,'' and ACTA's legislative history provided no guidance as to which vehicles
to include in a ``light-duty truck'' definition for theft prevention purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed to base its definition of ``light-duty truck'' for Theft Prevention Standard purposes
on NHTSA's definition of ``truck'' at 49 CFR 571.3: ``a motor vehicle with motive power, except a trailer, designed
primarily for the transportation of property or special purpose equipment.'' After taking into account ACTA's 6,000
pound gross vehicle weight rating limitation, NHTSA proposed to define ``light-duty truck'' as: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A motor vehicle with motive power, except a trailer, designed primarily for the transportation of property or special
purpose equipment, that is rated at 6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight or less. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Specifying ``Major Parts'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA also sought public comments on major parts for MPVs and LDTs. 49 U.S.C. 33101(6)(A) through (K) specifies parts
that are ``major parts.'' Under section 33101(6)(L), NHTSA has authority to specify as ``major parts'' other parts
that it specifies are ``comparable in design or function to any of the parts listed.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At 49 CFR 541.5, NHTSA has specified the major parts on high theft passenger car lines that must be marked. With a few
exceptions, &sect;541.5 lists all major parts specified in 49 U.S.C. 33101(6). The agency did not use its authority
to add additional parts to the list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After passage of ACTA, there is no longer a statutory limit on the number of parts per vehicle that may be marked. However,
the costs of marking a vehicle may not exceed $15 (in 1984 dollars). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In discussing the proposal for marking major parts for LDTs and/or MPVs, NHTSA applied the same criteria used to select
the current 14 major parts specified in the Theft Prevention Standard at &sect;541.5(a). The selection criteria
are whether the parts are among those most frequently repaired or most costly to replace. (See 50

FR 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
19728, at 19732; May 10, 1985.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Relying on public comments in response to the ANPRM, NHTSA proposed that parts listed in the Theft Prevention Standard
at &sect;541.5(a)(1) through (11) should, if present on a vehicle, be treated as major parts for MPVs and LDTs also.
Since the 11 parts listed are among the most frequently repaired and costly to replace, NHTSA tentatively found that
the parts, if present on MPVs and LDTs, should be major parts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the NPRM, NHTSA also proposed to designate additional parts as major parts for MPVs and LDTs. Although right and
left rear quarter panels (designated as major parts in 49 CFR 541.5(a)(12) and (13)), are not necessarily present
on MPVs or LDTs, NHTSA proposed that for MPVs, in lieu of quarter panels, side-panels should be designated as major
parts, and for LDTs, pickup boxes or cargo boxes should be designated as major parts. NHTSA stated its belief that the
side panels and pickup or cargo boxes are among the parts most frequently repaired. NHTSA also proposed to include
cargo doors on an LDT or MPV, as major parts.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Motor Vehicle Glazing as ``Major Parts'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the ANPRM, certain commenters recommended that windows and other pieces of motor vehicle glazing be
specified as major parts for all high theft vehicles. One company, Prospective Technologies, cited the relative
ease with which vehicle glazing could be marked, and the low cost of marking (which Prospective estimated to be $5.00
per vehicle). Prospective also cited Nissan's success in lowering theft rates of the Nissan 300ZX by as much as 26 per
cent after the windows of all 300ZX models were etched with the vehicle identification number beginning in model year
1992.

Based in part on this favorable information, NHTSA proposed to specify marking of passenger motor vehicle parts.
NHTSA tentatively agreed that specifying pieces of glazing as major parts to be marked pursuant to the Theft Prevention
Standard would further the statutory purpose. Since the markings on glazing would be in plain view, all types of motor
vehicle theft, not just theft for the purposes of chop shop operations or other trafficking in stolen motor vehicle
parts, might be deterred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA sought comment whether lower theft rates would result if only some glazing parts were specified for marking
and if so, which parts could be excluded. NHTSA also sought comment on three additional issues arising from the proposal
to require marking of glazing parts.

4. Parts Marking for Non-High Theft Lines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
49 U.S.C. 33103 requires NHTSA, by October 25, 1994, to promulgate a parts marking standard applicable to major parts
installed by manufacturers of ``passenger motor vehicles (other than light duty trucks) in not to exceed one-half
of the lines not designated under section 33104 as high theft lines.'' In carrying out section 33103, NHTSA began by
reviewing theft rates of the 231 vehicle lines that were listed in the 1990/91 theft data. (See 59 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FR 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
12400, March 16, 1994) A total of 116 vehicle lines (any line rated at number 116 or lower) was in the eligible pool of
lines potentially subject to parts marking pursuant to section 33103. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the statutory mandate, NHTSA removed all light duty truck lines from the eligible pool. Section 33103(a)
further directs NHTSA to select only lines ``not designated under section 33104 of this title as high theft lines.''
Thus, NHTSA removed any passenger motor vehicle line that NHTSA had previously determined to be high theft. NHTSA
tentatively applied the definition of ``light duty truck'' proposed in the NPRM, and stated it would make appropriate
changes if a different definition were adopted in the final rule.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After removing the ineligible lines, NHTSA determined that there were 57 below-median lines still eligible for selection
under section 33103. Out of the 57 below-median lines left, NHTSA designated the 28 lines with the highest theft rates
to be marked pursuant to section 33103. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA proposed to list each of the selected lines in appendix B to part 541. Pursuant to section 33103, NHTSA proposed
that parts marking for these below-median lines begin with MY 1996, the first model year that begins at least six months
after October 1994. Since section 33103 did not specify marking of replacement parts for below-median lines, NHTSA
did not propose to require marking for replacement parts.

III. Public Comments on the NPRM 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the NPRM, NHTSA received comments from 15 commenters: Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety (Advocates),
the American Automobile Manufacturers' Association (AAMA), Automark, Chrysler, Ford, Honda, General Motors (GM),
the International Association of Auto Theft Investigators (IAATI), Isuzu, the National Automobile Dealers Association
(NADA), Nissan, Prospective Technologies, Toyota, and Volkswagen. The commenters discussed the issues raised
in the NPRM as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Definitions of ``Light Duty Truck'' and ``Multipurpose Passenger Vehicle'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA received five comments on the definition of ``light duty truck'' (LDT). Four commenters stated that NHTSA's
proposed definition of LDT was consistent with the Anti Car Theft Act of 1992, and should not be changed. Advocates
for Highway and Auto Safety, on the other hand, stated that since ACTA was intended to expand the number and types of
vehicles subject to parts marking, the LDT definition should be ``drawn as narrowly as reasonable under the circumstances.''
Advocates recommended that LDTs be defined as those vehicles: ``built and intended for use exclusively for the transportation
of property or special purpose equipment.'' Thus, Advocates appears to urge that LDT be defined to make as many low
theft vehicle lines as possible subject to parts marking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the agency's view, this outcome would be inconsistent with Congress's action in exempting low-theft LDTs from
the requirement. Moreover, after reviewing the 1990/91 final theft data for LDT lines, NHTSA found few LDT lines with
below-median theft rates. If NHTSA included all below-median LDT lines, only four additional vehicle lines (the
Nissan, Toyota, Isuzu, and Ford Ranger pick ups) would be added to the 28 lines that were proposed for inclusion in appendix
B. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, since Advocates' definition would result in vehicles being classified as MPVs for theft purposes that
are classified as trucks for vehicle identification number (VIN) purposes under the vehicle safety standards, adopting
Advocates' definition of LDT would make it difficult for NHTSA to track and monitor the theft history of these LDT lines
through the use of VINs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since there were no other comments addressing the definition of LDT, this final rule adopts the definition of ``light-duty
truck'' proposed in the NPRM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since only Ford addressed the definition of ``multipurpose passenger vehicle'' and it concurred with the definition
discussed in the NPRM, NHTSA is adopting the NPRM's definition of ``multipurpose passenger vehicle.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Specifying ``Major Parts'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters suggested specifying additional parts as ``major parts.'' Advocates recommended the addition of
airbag modules. IAATI recommended that for LDTs and MPVs, the vehicle frame and radiator support assemblies be added.
NHTSA will not adopt these recommendations because it does not determine that at present, airbag modules, frames,
and radiator support assemblies are among those parts most frequently repaired or most costly to replace, the criteria
NHTSA has used to determine whether a part should be specified a ``major part.'' However, since air bags will be mandatory
for all passenger motor vehicles by model year 1999, the determination for airbag modules may be changed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Toyota stated that no additional parts should be specified until there are ``positive results'' from a Justice Department
study on the efficacy of parts marking. This study is mandated at 49 U.S.C. 33103(d). NHTSA is not adopting Toyota's
recommendation because the Justice Department's findings are not due until December 1999. The ACTA directs NHTSA,
well before 1999, to extend coverage of the parts marking requirements of the Theft Prevention Standard to LDTs and
MPVs. In order to effectively extend parts marking requirements to LDTs and MPVs, NHTSA must specify parts unique
to LDTS or MPVs that must be marked. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, NHTSA adopts as final the following as major parts for passenger cars, LDTs, and MPVs: engine, transmission,
right and left front fenders, hood, right and left front doors, right and left rear doors, sliding or cargo door(s),
front and rear bumpers, and the rear door (both doors in case of double doors), decklid, tailgate, or hatchback (whichever
is present). In addition, for passenger cars, the right and rear quarter panels are major parts. For MPVs, the right-side
and left-side assemblies are major parts. For LDTs, the pickup box, and/or cargo box are major parts.

3. Marking of Motor Vehicle Glazing Parts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although NHTSA proposed specifying vehicle glazing parts as major parts, the final rule does not specify any vehicle
glazing parts as major parts. Except for the Advocates and IAATI, all other commenters opposed specifying glazing
parts as major parts, and thus making glazing subject to parts marking. Among the reasons cited was that NHTSA does
not have authority to require marking of parts that are not among the ``major parts'' specified in 49 U.S.C. 33101(6)
(A) through (K), or are (under (L)) ``comparable in design or function to any of the parts listed in subparagraphs (A)
through (K).''

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While NHTSA believes the statute gives the agency ample discretion to determine that glazing parts are ``major parts,''
it has concluded that the cost of such marking would make the cost per vehicle of marking parts likely to exceed the statutory
maximum. An important rationale for NHTSA's proposal in the NPRM to require marking of glazing parts was that it perceived
the cost of marking glazing as relatively low, when considering the lower theft rates shown in certain vehicles with
marked glazing. 49 U.S.C. 33105(a) limits the per vehicle cost of parts marking to $15 (in 1984 dollars). In 1993 dollars,
the per vehicle costs of marking may not exceed $20.86 (see 59 FR 8021, February 17, 1994). Since the experience of Prospective
Technologies appeared to show that marking of glazing would cost about $5.00 per vehicle, NHTSA believed that even
if it specified marking of glazing parts, the per vehicle cost of marking would not exceed $20.86. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public comments, however, questioned whether marking of glazing could be done for as little as $5.00 per vehicle.
GM noted that marking glazing would add approximately $6.25 to the cost of marking each GM vehicle, ``nearly doubling''
the per vehicle costs of parts marking. GM further noted that the $6.25 costs do not include items such as accidental
glass breakage or glass replacement due to inadvertent VIN error, or the costs of stencil cutter maintenance or stencil
cutter replacement. Although Toyota did not provide specific dollar figures, it stated the $5.00 per vehicle cost
of marking glazing was not feasible, and that ``it is certain'' that the cost increase to mark Toyota lines would be
more than $15.00. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nissan, the company which manufactures the Nissan 300ZX, whose windows were marked by Prospective Technologies,
estimated that the current costs of marking vehicle parts (not including glazing) is between $14 to $20. In contrast
to Prospective's figure of $5.00 per vehicle, Nissan estimated that the present cost of marking glazing on its 300ZX
line (at the port of entry, and using a chemical treatment process) is $25.00 per vehicle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Volkswagen stated that the 1990 cost of marking a Volkswagen vehicle was 25.02 Deutsche marks, or approximately $15.77,
to label all parts, except for the engine and transmission. NHTSA notes that if the cost of inflation since 1990, the
cost of marking the engine and transmission, and (using Prospective Technologies' figure of $5.00 per vehicle) the
cost to mark glazing were all added to the $15.77 figure, Volkswagen's cost of marking a vehicle would exceed the $20.86
limit specified in section 33105(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the public comments received, NHTSA believes specifying glazing parts as major parts, may make the costs
of parts marking for some manufacturers exceed the $20.86 limit specified in section 33105(a). Additionally, Ford
noted that windows are rarely stolen as replacement parts. NADA stated there is no evidence in the record suggesting
that vehicles are stolen for their glazing materials. Thus, in this final rule, NHTSA is not specifying any glazing
as a ``major part'' under 49 CFR 541.5(a).

4. Parts Marking of Non-High-Theft Lines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ford disagreed with the agency over how to distribute vehicle lines between appendix A (high-theft lines) and the
new appendix B (non-high-theft lines that must now be marked). In Ford's view, appendix B should include up to half
of the vehicle lines that fall below the median, regardless of whether such lines had previously been listed in appendix
A. The agency had proposed to exclude from appendix B any below-median vehicle line that had been previously listed
in appendix A, and to base appendix B on up to half of the remaining below-median vehicle lines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Ford's proposed method, up to 54 car lines would be listed in appendix B, but many of these would be lines already
included in appendix A and therefore already required to have their parts marked. Under the agency's method, 28 vehicle
lines were proposed to be listed in appendix B, none of which had previously had their parts marked. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering Ford's comment, NHTSA has concluded that the agency's proposed method carries out ACTA's purpose
more faithfully than does Ford's method. As codified, section 33103(a) directs the marking of parts on ``not more
than 50 percent of the lines not designated under section 33104 of this title as high theft lines.'' Section 33104,
in turn, states that vehicle lines that were subject to marking under the pre-ACTA law (i.e., the lines listed in appendix
A) continue to be subject to the requirements of the section. Read together, the provisions support the agency's view
that vehicle lines previously listed in appendix A should continue to be listed in that appendix and not in appendix
B. The agency has adopted the procedure as proposed and has determined the vehicle lines in appendix B accordingly.
However, Ford's comments have caused NHTSA to reexamine the lines it proposed for inclusion in appendix B. The agency
found 6 vehicle lines placed in the bottom quartile of the 1990/91 final theft data. The 6 lines, the Ford Aerostar and
Explorer, the General Motors Oldsmobile Cutlass Cruiser, the Volvo 240 and 940, and the Volkswagen Audi 80/90, will
be removed from appendix B. NHTSA will also remove the Daihatsu Rocky MPV from appendix B, since the Rocky is no longer
sold in the United States. The final rule lists the 21 remaining vehicle lines.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the foregoing, NHTSA proposed to include a definition of ``1990/91 median theft rate.'' Based on 231
vehicle lines, the 1990/91 median theft rate was 3.5826 thefts per thousand vehicles produced. Since NHTSA received
no comments on ``1990/91 median theft rate,'' it is adopting the definition proposed in the NPRM.

Procedure for Selecting Lines to be Covered by the Theft Prevention Standard, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA proposed to apply the 1990/91 median theft rate to passenger motor vehicle lines to be introduced for model year
(MY) 1996 and thereafter. However, as explained below, since this final rule does not begin to apply to affected vehicle
lines until MY 1997, NHTSA will continue to apply the 1983/84 median theft rate to passenger car lines introduced before
MY 1997.

IV. Effective Date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed that the changes described in the NPRM, if made final, would take effect beginning with
model year 1996. With the possible exception of Honda, all commenters requested a longer leadtime than the April 25,
1995 proposed in the NPRM. The longer leadtimes requested ranged from a year after publication of the final rule (Mazda
and Nissan) to September 1, 1996, almost two years after publication of the final rule (Chrysler and General Motors).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As reasons for requesting the longer leadtime, the commenters stated that extra time was needed to buy new equipment
or to change manufacturing processes. In particular, Chrysler stated that production of its ``pull-ahead'' MY 1996
Chrysler Town and Country MPVs (already selected by NHTSA as a high theft line) will begin in January 1995, only two
months after publication of the final rule. Since the changes prescribed in this final rule take effect ``at least
6 months after the date the standard is prescribed'' (49 U.S.C. 33103(e)), if the final rule were to take effect on April
25, 1995, NHTSA could not require marking of the Town and Country line. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering the comments, NHTSA has decided the new parts marking procedures for LDTs, MPVs, and vehicle lines
listed in appendix B will take effect with MY 1997. NHTSA decided the extra lead time is necessary because manufacturers
are being required to mark new vehicle types (MPVs and LDTs) and to mark low theft lines never before subject to parts
marking. Extra time is needed for manufacturers to buy equipment, determine vehicles' target areas for parts marking,
and to decide whether to submit a petition for exemption from parts marking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA also believes that all manufacturers should begin the new procedures in the same model year. MY 1997 is the earliest
model year for which all manufacturers can ensure that their lines comply.

V. Regulatory Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

1. Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice has not been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. NHTSA has considered the impact of this rulemaking
action and has determined the action not to be ``significant'' under the Department of Transportation's regulatory
policies and procedures. This action defines ``light-duty truck'' (LDT) and ``multipurpose passenger vehicle''
(MPV) and specifies LDT and MPV parts that should be considered ``major parts.'' As a result of defining LDT and MPV,
those lines are now included as ``passenger motor vehicle'' lines subject to the Theft Prevention Standard. In this
final rule, the definition of LDT affects low theft lines that are selected for parts marking, pursuant to 49 U.S.C.
section 33103. Since section 33103(a) excludes LDTs from its coverage, any passenger motor vehicle with a low theft
rate (other than an LDT) would be subject to parts marking. The definition clarifies which vehicles Congress intended
to be subject, as LDTs, to the marking of high theft passenger motor vehicle lines, but excluded from the potential
rules for marking of low theft passenger motor vehicle lines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, the selection of the MPV and LDT parts to be marked is already, in large part, decided by Congress in 49 U.S.C.
33101, since the term ``major parts'' is defined at 49 U.S.C. 33101(6). However, the agency has authority under section
33101(6)(L) to make modifications to the statutory list, and for major parts of LDTs and MPVs, has exercised this authority.
The overall cost of marking the MPVs and LDTs would, in any event, be limited to the $15 (in 1984 dollars), or $20.86 (in
1993 dollars, based on the U.S. Department of Labor's United States City Average All Items Consumer Price Index for
All Urban Consumers (See 59 FR 8021, February 17, 1994)) per vehicle maximum specified in section 33105(a).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this final rule, high theft MPVs and LDTs, and lines listed in Appendix B must add parts marking for a total of $5.06
per vehicle. Based on 1991 production figures, an additional 7.4 million would need to be marked, making the approximate
cost of marking high theft MPVs, LDTs, and lines listed in Appendix B, $37 million. However, NHTSA believes the $37
million estimate is high because many manufacturers will petition for approval to use an antitheft device, in lieu
of parts marking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, NHTSA estimates that the total cost of this final rule would be approximately $37 million, considerably less
than the $89 million estimated in the NPRM, which included costs to mark glazing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA cannot estimate the benefits of this final rule. The average value of a stolen vehicle is approximately $6,100.
Thus, this final rule would have to result in the prevention of about 6,100 vehicle thefts ($37 million divided by $6,100)
to break even with the costs imposed.

The agency has also considered the effects of this rulemaking action under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I certify
that this proposed rule, if made final, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. As already noted, this final rule defines ``light duty truck'' and ``multipurpose passenger vehicle,''
and specifies parts for MPVs and LDTs that should be designated as ``major parts.'' The final rule itself will have
minimal effects on small manufacturers of passenger motor vehicles, as almost none of the manufacturers of passenger
motor vehicles that may be subject to this rule is considered a small business. This final rule will have no effect on
small organizations or governmental units that purchase passenger motor vehicles. Accordingly, the agency has
not prepared a regulatory flexibility analysis.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On May 15, 1991, NHTSA made several technical amendments to conform the language of part 567, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Certification,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 to new regulations, issued in September 1989, regarding the importation of motor vehicles not originally manufactured
in compliance with the Federal motor vehicle safety standards (56 FR 22355). The reader is referred to that notice
for further information on this subject. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Inadvertently, the agency neglected to include paragraph 567.4(k) in the amendments to part 567. Paragraph (k) applies
to those ``passenger cars admitted to the United States under 19 CFR 12.80(b)(1)'' which lack an original manufacturer's
certification of compliance with the Federal motor vehicle safety standards. The correct citation is to Paragraph
591.5(f). This notice effects that correction. The notice also revises the authority citations to reflect the recodification
in Title 49 of the agency's authorities previously in Title 15. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the amendment is technical in nature and has no substantive impact, it is hereby found that notice and comment
thereon are unnecessary, and that good cause is shown that an effective date earlier than 180 days after issuance of
the rule is in the public interest. Therefore, the amendment is effective upon publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending its regulations governing the content and format on labeling for
human prescription drug products. The final rule revises the current ``Pediatric use'' subsection of the professional
labeling requirements for prescription drugs to provide for the inclusion of more complete information about the
use of a drug in the pediatric population (ages birth to 16 years). The final rule, which applies to prescription drug
products (including biological prescription drug products), recognizes several methods of establishing substantial
evidence to support pediatric labeling claims, including relying, in certain cases, on studies carried out in adults.
This final rule also requires that if there is not substantial evidence to support any pediatric use or use in a particular
pediatric population, the labeling shall state this. Sponsors must reexamine existing data to determine whether
the ``Pediatric use'' subsection of the labeling can be modified based on adequate and well-controlled studies in
adults, and other information supporting pediatric use, and, if appropriate, submit a supplemental application
to comply with new &sect;201.57(f)(9)(iv) by December 13, 1996. This action responds to concerns in FDA and elsewhere
that current prescription drug labeling often does not contain adequate information about the use of drugs in the
pediatric population. This action promotes safer and more effective use of prescription drugs in the pediatric population.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of October 16, 1992 (57 FR 47423), FDA proposed to amend its regulations pertaining to the content and format of prescription
drug labeling in &sect;201.57 by revising the current ``Pediatric use'' subsection (&sect;201.57(f)(9)) to allow
a broader basis for the inclusion of information about use of a drug in the pediatric population. The proposal would
have allowed pediatric claims based not only on adequate and well-controlled studies in the pediatric population
but also, in some cases, on such trials in adults. The proposed regulation described other data needed when pediatric
claims are based on trials in adults and indicated specific labeling language and the location of various kinds of
information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA issued the current pediatric labeling requirements in 1979 (44 FR 37434, June 26, 1979). The current regulation,
codified at &sect;201.57(f)(9), requires that specific pediatric indications, if any, be described under the ``Indications
and Usage'' section of the labeling, with appropriate pediatric dosage provided under the ``Dosage and Administration''
section. The current regulation also requires that recommendations for pediatric use be based on substantial evidence
derived from adequate and well-controlled studies in the pediatric population, unless that requirement is waived.
If a drug's safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population cannot be established or if the drug's use in the pediatric
population is associated with a specific hazard, the current regulation requires appropriate statements or details.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By establishing a ``Pediatric use'' subsection and describing its content and format, the 1979 regulation was intended
to encourage drug labeling that would regularly provide adequate information about use of prescription drugs in
pediatric patients. As stated in the preamble to the proposed rule on which this final rule is based, however, most
prescription drug products still lack adequate information about their use in pediatric populations. For example,
an informal survey done in 1990 by the American Academy of Pediatrics examined labeling of all new molecular entities
approved between 1984 and 1989 and found that 80 percent had no information on pediatric use. Other surveys have shown
that the labeling for many prescription drugs states that safety and effectiveness in children have not been established
and contains no information on pediatric use, even for drugs that are commonly prescribed for pediatric patients.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA continues to be concerned that, without adequate information, practitioners may be reluctant to prescribe certain
drugs for their pediatric patients, or may prescribe them inappropriately, choosing dosages, for instance, that
are arbitrarily based on the child's age, body weight, or body surface area without specific information as to whether
this is appropriate. As a result, pediatric patients may be exposed to an increased risk of adverse reactions, or decreased
effectiveness of the drugs prescribed, or may be denied access to valuable therapeutic agents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The continuing absence of pediatric use information in prescription drug labeling may be due in part to the impression,
perhaps conveyed by the existing regulation, that pediatric claims must always be based on adequate and well-controlled
studies conducted in the pediatric population. Given the many problems associated with the testing of drugs in the
pediatric population (e.g., obtaining informed consent for tests not directly of benefit to the child, use of placebo
controls in a vulnerable population), studies meeting this standard are often difficult to obtain. Existing FDA
regulations do not, in fact, require that controlled trials always be conducted in the pediatric population to support
a pediatric use. Under current &sect;201.57(f)(9), the need for such studies may be waived where other data can satisfy
the requirements of law. The basis for granting such a waiver is not, however, clear in the existing regulation. Section
201.57(f)(9)(iv) of this final rule clarifies how the agency will determine that data from adequate and well-controlled
studies with adult subjects can provide substantial evidence of effectiveness in the pediatric population.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, this rule is intended to provide practitioners with more pediatric use information in the labeling of
human prescription drug products so that practitioners will have more reliable information upon which to base a decision
to prescribe a drug for use in their pediatric patients. The rule does this by encouraging manufacturers to provide
more information on drug labels upon which practitioners can base their decisions. The rule does not, however, limit
the manner in which a practitioner may prescribe an approved drug.

II. Highlights of the Final Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule revises the current ``Pediatric use'' subsection of the professional labeling requirements for prescription
drugs to provide for the inclusion of more comprehensive information about use of a drug in the pediatric population.
Under the final rule, products may be labeled for pediatric use based on adequate and well-controlled studies in adults
together with other information supporting pediatric use (e.g., pharmacokinetic data, safety data, pharmacodynamic
data). Such reliance on studies in adults was possible under the waiver provision in the existing rule, but the waiver
provision was not often used. Of course, products may also be labeled for pediatric use based on adequate and well-controlled
studies in the pediatric population. The pediatric age group, birth to 16 years, includes pediatric age groups often
called neonates, infants, children, and adolescents. In the final rule, because the term ``children'' can be interpreted
as referring only to a particular subset of the pediatric population (ages 2 to 12 years), and to make clear that the
provisions of this rule apply to the entire pediatric population, references to ``children'' in the proposed rule
have been deleted and replaced by ``pediatric population'' or ``pediatric patients.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The major provisions of the final rule are summarized as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule continues to permit a specific pediatric indication (i.e., an indication different from those approved
in adults) supported by adequate and well-controlled studies in the appropriate pediatric population, to be described
under the ``Indications and Usage'' section of the labeling, with the appropriate pediatric dosage given under the
``Dosage and Administration'' section of the labeling. The ``Pediatric use'' subsection of the labeling must include
any limitations on the pediatric indication, need for specific monitoring, specific hazards of the drug, differences
between pediatric and adult responses to the drug, and other information related to the safe and effective use of the
drug in pediatric patients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If there are specific statements on pediatric use of the drug for an indication also approved for adults that are based
on adequate and well-controlled studies in the pediatric population, they must be summarized in the ``Pediatric
use'' subsection of the labeling and discussed in more detail, if appropriate, under the ``Clinical Pharmacology''
and ``Clinical Studies'' sections. Appropriate pediatric dosage must be given under the ``Dosage and Administration''
section of the labeling. This subsection of the labeling must also cite any limitations on the pediatric use statement,
need for specific monitoring, specific hazards associated with use of the drug in any subsets of the pediatric population
(e.g., neonates), differences between pediatric and adult responses to the drug, and other information related
to the safe and effective pediatric use of the drug. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A pediatric use statement may also be based on adequate and well-controlled studies in adults, provided that the agency
concludes that the course of the disease and the drug's effects are sufficiently similar in the pediatric and adult
populations to permit extrapolation from the adult efficacy data to pediatric patients. Where needed, pharmacokinetic
data to allow determination of an appropriate pediatric dosage, and additional pediatric safety information must
also be submitted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where the requirements for a finding of substantial evidence to support a specific pediatric indication or a pediatric
use statement have not been met for a particular pediatric subgroup, the ``Pediatric use'' subsection of the labeling
must contain a statement that appropriately characterizes the limitation, such as ``Safety and effectiveness in
pediatric patients [below the age of (_) (years/months/weeks)] have not been established.'' If use of the drug is
associated with a specific hazard in this pediatric subgroup, the ``Pediatric use'' subsection must contain information
about this hazard, or, where appropriate, refer to a more complete description of the hazard in the ``Contraindications''
or ``Warnings'' section of the labeling.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where the requirements for a finding of substantial evidence to support a pediatric indication or a pediatric use
statement have not been met for any pediatric population, the ``Pediatric use'' subsection of the labeling must contain
the following statement: ``Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.'' If use of
the drug in premature or neonatal infants, or other pediatric subgroups, is associated with a specific hazard, the
``Pediatric use'' subsection must contain information about this hazard, or, where appropriate, refer to a more
complete description of the hazard in the ``Contraindications'' or ``Warnings'' section of the labeling.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any sponsor who believes that no ``Pediatric use'' subsection is appropriate or relevant to the labeling of its particular
drug product must provide FDA with reasons justifying its omission, and may propose alternative statement(s). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, recognizing the hazards that inactive ingredients can pose to the pediatric population, the final rule
requires that prescription drug labeling contain statements about inactive ingredients that might be toxic to the
neonate or other pediatric subgroup.

III. General Comments on the Proposed Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA received 11 comments on the proposed rule from prescription drug manufacturers, prescribers, professional
societies, organizations with special interests in the pediatric population, the lay public, and others. Most supported
the proposed labeling change, calling it ``timely and important,'' ``an important * * * step to facilitate the inclusion
of information about use of drugs in children in the approved labeling,'' ``a significant step toward the goal of including
infants and children in the drug approval process,'' and a way ``to fill the gap of information that currently exists
in the area of appropriate drug usage in children.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment, for example, stated that providing pediatric use information in labeling will help health professionals
reach rational drug therapy decisions for pediatric patients. The comment added ``any information that can be used
by pharmacists to assure rational drug therapy in special populations will be a positive addition to drug information.
* * * Such labeling will enhance the likelihood of positive outcomes in pediatric patients.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, some comments were less supportive, including one that stated: ``While * * * [we] commend the FDA on its initiatives
to improve information available to physicians and their pediatric patients regarding prescription drug use, we
remain concerned that this approach will not measurably assist physicians.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most comments also raised specific issues for consideration by the agency. These issues are described below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Definition of ``Pediatric'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Several comments suggested that age breakdowns within the pediatric population might be appropriate. The pediatric
age range begins at birth, and may cover individuals as old as 18 years to 21 years, encompassing the subspecialties
of neonatology and adolescent medicine. One comment suggested that the rule define ``pediatric'' as children under
12 years, because ``it has been commonly accepted that ages 12 years to 18 years may be included without previous clinical
work in that age group.'' The comment also suggested that the rule state the age group when pharmacokinetic studies
should be done in order to extrapolate the results from infancy through adolescence, or state whether the age range
will be broken into subgroups with testing required for each. Another comment said that a definition of ``pediatric''
would have to consider drug metabolism, pharmacokinetics, and interaction with various organs and other body systems.
The comment suggested that a system by which distinct classes of drugs are considered differently may be more logical
and appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another comment noted that pediatric patients are not homogeneous, and that age groups show significant differences
in functional and physiological functions. The comment suggested that information from clinical studies be subdivided
by age groups and their respective responses to drugs, suggesting age categories of premature infant, newborn, children
under 2 years of age, children 2 years to 13 years, and adolescents 13 years to 18 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another comment said that individuals 16 years to 18 years of age pose particular problems and suggested consultation
with the American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on Drugs to consider defining age categories or groups for pediatric
labeling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``Pediatric use'' subsection of labeling is where information about use of a drug in pediatric patients is located,
and &sect;201.57(f)(9) describes in general terms the kind of information that should be included. The ``Pediatric
use'' subsection does not attempt to resolve the many difficult issues related to use of drugs in this population.
What appears in this subsection (e.g., age groups covered) will depend on the data available, and the ability to define
results for specific subgroups. As a general matter, however, the agency offers the following guidance and useful
breakdowns. The following age categories for the pediatric population are commonly distinguished, although the
distinctions are inevitably arbitrary: (1) Birth up to 1 month (neonates), (2) 1 month up to 2 years of age (infants),
(3) 2 years up to 12 years (children), and (4) 12 years up to 16 years (adolescents). Where possible, data should be analyzed
by these groups, but it should not usually be necessary to establish a drug product's effectiveness in each group.
It may, on the other hand, be important to have some pharmacokinetic information in each group, especially the younger
age groups, to guide dosing and additional information, such as a specific study in neonates, to establish safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the agency has determined that the term ``pediatric patients'' refers to individuals from birth to 16 years
of age, the agency recognizes that for some drugs, adult studies may be applicable to pediatric patients under the
age of 16 years who have passed puberty; indeed, a primary purpose of this rule is to allow pediatric labeling based
on adult studies, when appropriate. Although in many cases, additional pharmacokinetic and safety data may be needed
to support pediatric use statements, in other cases, particularly for pediatric patients in the 12-to 16-year age
group, there may be less additional data needed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. One comment noted that about 80 percent of drug labeling currently contains language excluding use of the drug in
pediatric patients or limiting use only to specific age groups. The comment asked FDA to encourage sponsors to include
pediatric patients in their clinical studies when the drug is likely to be effective for an indication in this population.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, FDA encourages sponsors to include pediatric patients in their clinical
studies, and analyzes investigational new drug applications and new drug applications (NDA's) to determine whether
studies in this population should be done before the drug is approved (57 FR 47423 at 47424). Under certain circumstances,
the agency may require that clinical studies in the pediatric population be conducted before marketing approval
(see response to comment number 4 in section III.C. of this document). If a drug is likely to be effective for pediatric
use, the agency is making it clear that labeling for pediatric use may sometimes be based on adequate and well-controlled
studies in adults, with additional pediatric data. FDA intends that this rule will call further attention to the need
for creating and reviewing data on pediatric use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. One comment asked whether FDA intended to require a sponsor to submit information for a specific pediatric indication
or use if there are available data suggesting that such an indication or use would be permitted under the regulation.
The comment said that there may be ``good reasons'' why a sponsor might not wish to seek a pediatric indication or use
for a drug even when available evidence would support such a use. For example, the drug's benefit/risk ratio in the
pediatric population might be different from that in adults, or there might be sufficient and better alternative
therapies available for the pediatric use. Additionally, the comment expressed concern that a drug that has been
tested in adults may not provide a sufficient legal defense against a claim for injury of a child. The comment said that
a sponsor should not be forced to assume or be placed in the position of having to defend such an action unless the sponsor
believes the data in support of the pediatric use are sufficient, and that a sponsor should not be mandated or forced
by the rule to seek a pediatric use if the sponsor, for whatever reason, does not wish to do so.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another comment expressed concern that FDA might delay approval of products that have good existing available data
for safety and efficacy in adults while acceptable pediatric information is developed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule does not add a new requirement that sponsors carry out new pediatric studies, nor does it require that sponsors
submit labeling with claims that are inadequately supported. New &sect;201.57(f)(9)(iv) provides that a pediatric
use statement may be based on adequate and well-controlled studies in adults, provided that the course of the disease
and the drug effects are sufficiently similar in the pediatric and adult populations to permit extrapolation from
the adult efficacy data to pediatric patients. Sponsors are required to reexamine existing data to determine whether
the ``Pediatric use'' subsection of the labeling can be modified based on adequate and well-controlled studies in
adults, and other information supporting pediatric use, and, if safety and effectiveness for pediatric use have
been demonstrated, submit a supplemental application to comply with new &sect;201.57(f)(9)(iv) by December 13,
1996. A sponsor who does not believe that the disease and drug effects are similar in the pediatric and adult populations,
or who believes that use in pediatric patients is otherwise not adequately supported by data, should not propose revised
labeling under this provision. Under new &sect;201.57(f)(9)(vi), the sponsor may propose labeling stating that
safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, under new &sect;201.57(f)(9)(vii), if the sponsor believes that none of the statements described
in paragraphs (f)(9)(ii) through (f)(9)(vi) of that section is appropriate or relevant to the labeling of a particular
drug, the sponsor must provide reasons for omission of the statements and may propose alternative statement(s).
In response to such a proposal, FDA may permit use of an alternative statement if FDA determines that no statement described
in those paragraphs is appropriate or relevant to the drug's labeling and that the alternative statement is accurate
and appropriate. Section 201.57(f)(9)(vii) has been modified to make this explicit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although this rule does not add new requirements for conducting pediatric studies, various provisions of the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act), the Public Health Service Act (the PHS act), and existing regulations authorize
FDA to require such studies under certain circumstances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 505(k) of the act (21 U.S.C. 355(k)), FDA may require NDA holders to establish records and submit reports
to the agency on data relating to clinical experience or other data or information in order to determine whether there
may be grounds for revoking the NDA approval. Such a requirement may be established either through regulation or through
an order regarding the NDA (21 U.S.C. 355(k)(1)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing regulations require application holders to report to the agency adverse experiences occurring in the course
of use of the product in professional practice, as well as during clinical investigations (21 CFR 312.32, 314.80).
In addition, approved application holders must submit as part of the annual report a summary of significant new information
that might affect the safety, effectiveness, or labeling of the product, as well as copies of unpublished and published
reports of studies of the drug (21 CFR 314.81(b)(2)(i), (b)(2)(v), and (b)(2)(vi)). The report also must contain
a description of the action the company has taken or intends to take because of the new information, such as submission
of a supplement, addition of a warning, or initiation of a new study (21 CFR 314.81(b)(2)(i)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 505(e) of the act specifies grounds on which the agency may withdraw or suspend approval of an NDA. If there
is an imminent hazard to the public health, approval of the NDA may be suspended immediately by the Secretary of the
Department of Health and Human Services. In addition to other circumstances, approval of an NDA is to be withdrawn
if clinical experience or other data show that the product is unsafe or not shown to be safe under the conditions of use
upon the basis of which the application was approved. Moreover, the approval may be withdrawn if the labeling is false
or misleading and not corrected within a reasonable time after notice of the matter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 502(a) of the act (21 U.S.C. 352(a)), a drug is considered misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading.
Section 201(n) of the act (21 U.S.C. 321(n)) makes it clear that the ``misleading'' determination is to be based not
only on representations made or suggested in the labeling, but also on failure to reveal material facts. Material
facts include those which concern consequences which may result from use of the product under the labeled conditions
of use or under customary or usual conditions of use. These conditions of use may include off-label uses prescribed
by practitioners for their patients.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, drugs are considered misbranded under section 502(f) of the act if the labeling fails to bear adequate
directions for use. FDA regulations define adequate directions for use as directions under which the lay person can
use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). ``Intended uses'' are further defined
in the regulations to include uses other than the ones on the labeling (21 CFR 201.128). If a manufacturer knows that
a drug is used for an off-label use, the manufacturer may be required to provide adequate labeling for that use (21 CFR
201.128).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prescription drugs for human use are exempt from the requirement to carry adequate directions for lay use under certain
circumstances, if labeled with the prescription legend (21 CFR 201.100). Among the exemption criteria is the requirement
that the drug carry adequate labeling for the prescriber, as authorized by an approved application, for the intended
use. In summary, the drug product is misbranded if the intended use is not approved in an NDA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Drug products are also misbranded, under section 502(f)(2) of the act, if the labeling does not carry adequate warnings
against unsafe use. Such unsafe use may include use by pediatric patients where the use may be dangerous to their health,
or unsafe dosage or methods or duration of administration in the pediatric population.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Biological drug products are approved under authority of section 351 of the PHS act (42 U.S.C. 262). This provision
authorizes the promulgation of regulations designed to ensure the continued safety, purity, and potency of the products
(42 U.S.C. 262(d)(1)). An approved product license application (PLA) may be revoked if the product does not conform
to applicable requirements in the regulations or is not safe and effective for all of its intended uses or is misbranded
with respect to any such use (21 CFR 601.5(b)(4) through (b)(6)). If there is a danger to health, the Commissioner may
suspend the product license (21 CFR 601.6). Under section 351(b) of the PHS act, no one may falsely label a biological
product. Biological drug products are also subject to the applicable drug provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act, as previously discussed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, the agency has stated that an application for marketing approval should contain data on a reasonable sample
of the patients likely to be given a drug once it is marketed (58 FR 39406 at 39409, July 22, 1993). This conclusion, stated
explicitly in a guideline on the need for data in both genders, applies equally to age subgroups, including pediatric
and geriatric populations. FDA may refuse to approve an application that fails to contain sufficient information
to determine whether the product can be safely and effectively used in populations likely to receive it. In addition,
for an approved drug, in certain cases (e.g., where the drug is widely used, represents a potential hazard, or is therapeutically
important in pediatric patients), FDA may require further studies in pediatric populations and appropriate labeling
changes. As previously discussed, an already approved drug may be considered illegally marketed if adequate information
on safe and effective use in pediatric patients is not obtained and included in the labeling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency thus expects sponsors to seek supplemental claims for pediatric uses that are supported by adequate data.
This does not imply, however, that a sponsor should seek a claim for a pediatric use if the benefits of that use do not
outweigh its risks; the determination of whether to include a pediatric use statement must be based on clinical data,
and other use information, not on a vague concern about liability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. One comment said that although the desire to use potentially relevant data in the ``Pediatric use'' subsection
of the labeling was ``understandable,'' such data should not take the place of adequate and well-designed controlled
studies in the pediatric population, and that FDA ultimately may have to require such studies. The comment stated
that FDA should require manufacturers to fund research projects regarding drug safety and efficacy, including short-term
and long-term side effects, in pediatric patients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA agrees that clinical studies regarding a drug's safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients are desirable,
and the agency encourages such studies in appropriate cases. As discussed in comment 4 in section III.C. of this document,
the agency has the authority to require such studies under certain circumstances. In some cases, such studies may
be required prior to approval where pediatric use is important and where the adult and pediatric diseases cannot be
considered sufficiently similar. In other cases, the controlled trials in adults, with pharmacokinetic and other
data as needed, may support valid pediatric labeling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. One comment stated that FDA should consider other alternatives to the rule, including a formal review process that
collects and analyzes available safety and efficacy data on a drug's use in the pediatric population both before and
after marketing approval, which, through committee review, could recommend further testing of the drug after it
is marketed if specific pediatric safety or efficacy concerns are found. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA believes that the comment has misinterpreted the purpose of the rule. The rule describes the kind of data and information
that can be included in labeling for the pediatric population. In general, it is the sponsor's responsibility to collect,
on a continuing basis, available data on safety and efficacy, propose revised labeling, and carry out needed studies.
In some circumstances, FDA has required pediatric studies prior to approval, elicited agreement by drug sponsors
at the time of marketing approval to carry out additional pediatric studies after approval, or stimulated conduct
of pediatric studies after approval. When appropriate, FDA makes use of its standing advisory committees to help
decide whether and when pediatric studies are needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. One comment stated that FDA should revise the rule to specify what data must be provided by manufacturers. The comment
asked what number of pediatric patients would be sufficient to determine if there is a difference in age-related response,
and how FDA will determine that all available information about the pediatric use of all available drugs has been included,
including epidemiologic studies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA declines to accept the comment's suggestion. The agency believes that specifying an exact number of pediatric
patients to be studied would be impractical due to variations in the pediatric population and responses to different
drugs. This is particularly true, given the various kinds of data that can be used under the rule to support pediatric
labeling.

8. One comment suggested that drugs currently under development or under review by FDA should be given special consideration
to avoid delays in development and approval associated with implementation of the rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA does not expect delays in review or approval as a result of this rule. FDA already examines available pediatric
data under current labeling regulations. The principal change created by the revised regulation is the ability to
rely on studies in adults to support pediatric efficacy in some situations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
9. One comment suggested that FDA work with manufacturers of approved drugs to develop a method that allows the manufacturers
to update their labeling in a quick and cost-effective manner. The comment also said that package inserts do not generally
reflect current scientific literature because of the problems with current methods of updating labeling. The comment
said that this had created situations where prescribers are making decisions on treatment modalities without the
benefit of timely information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA does not believe that changes in regulations are needed to allow timely updating of labeling. Under the current
regulations, applicants can propose changes in their approved labeling. FDA normally reviews supplements subject
to prior approval in the order received. Effectiveness supplements are rated as priority or standard and are subject
to performance goals set in connection with the Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. One comment said that the filing and approval of pediatric labeling supplements from different sponsors on different
timetables could mean that some labels for products considered to be substantially similar might be silent with regard
to pediatric usage, while others might be detailed. The comment suggested that FDA and the American Academy of Pediatrics'
Committee on Drugs could identify therapeutic classes to be relabeled first, so that FDA could review and approve
pediatric use labeling for products from different companies and coordinate implementation of labeling changes
for similar agents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to effectiveness claims, pharmacokinetics, and safety data, much information is drug specific and
will be reviewed as it is submitted. Therefore, the agency is not adopting the comment's suggestions. The agency advises,
however, that, in general, when a class of drug products is involved, FDA examines labeling as it applies to the class.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
11. One comment claimed that the rule places NDA holders at a competitive disadvantage relative to abbreviated new
drug application (ANDA) holders. The comment stated that the rule would give NDA holders the burden and responsibility
for pediatric studies and literature searches, but not impose a similar burden and responsibility on ANDA holders.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA disagrees with the comment in part. The rule is directed to anyone marketing a prescription drug and is intended
to encourage the inclusion of more complete information about use of a drug in the pediatric population and about hazards
associated with this use. The rule permits a new basis for reference to pediatric uses, but it does not impose a new requirement
to conduct studies in pediatric populations. To the extent that NDA holders have access to data not available to ANDA
holders, they will have more data to examine and more likelihood of having a basis for proposing changes to the ``Pediatric
use'' subsection of labeling. The agency believes this represents only a modest burden and, in any event, sees no other
way to gain further pediatric information in labeling. ANDA holders cannot be required to examine data they do not
possess. ANDA holders are not precluded from providing pediatric use data, and are expected to do so under this rule,
if data are available. An ANDA applicant who believes new safety or effectiveness information should be added to a
product's labeling should provide adequate supporting information to FDA, and FDA will determine whether the labeling
for the generic and listed drugs should be revised.

G. Minor Editorial Changes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
12. One comment said that labeling revisions that are editorial in nature and are used to reformat existing pediatric
use labeling information to conform to the rule should be made in accordance with &sect;314.70(d) (21 CFR 314.70(d))
(changes described in the annual report). The comment said that this would also facilitate the agency's processing
of minor changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA agrees with the comment. As stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, ``[m]inor editorial changes may be made
in accordance with &sect;314.70(d)'' (57 FR 47423 at 47426). To comply with this rule, references to ``children''
in the ``Pediatric use'' subsection of the insert labeling of products already being marketed must be changed, where
appropriate, to ``pediatric population'' or ``pediatric patients.'' For products other than biological products,
such changes are considered minor editorial changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, for biological products, such changes are to be submitted in accordance
with the procedures outlined in &sect;601.12 (21 CFR 601.12) (57 FR 47423 at 47426).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
13. One comment said that it is impractical and impossible to list on the labeling all dosages and hazards for the pediatric
population. The comment suggested placement of a general label on all adult prescription drugs stating that the medication
should not be given to pediatric patients without a physician's instructions. The comment said that requiring overly
complicated and lengthy information on labeling would discourage the prescribing of needed medications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA believes that the comment misinterprets the proposed rule and the purpose of pediatric use labeling. The purpose
of the rule is to encourage more pediatric use information in labeling and to provide practitioners with more information
on pediatric use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. One comment said that for certain products, e.g., corticosteroids, where class labeling has been in effect, the
agency will have to decide and communicate how the pediatric wording will be addressed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In most cases, pediatric labeling will be drug specific. Where class labeling exists, FDA generally examines the
labeling for those products as a whole.

A. Section 201.57(f)(9)(i)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA, on its own initiative, has added a definition in &sect;201.57(f)(9)(i) to indicate that under paragraphs (f)(9)(ii)
through (f)(9)(viii), the terms ``pediatric population(s)'' and ``pediatric patient(s)'' are defined as the pediatric
age group, from birth to 16 years, including age groups often called neonates, infants, children, and adolescents.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA received no comments on these provisions (renumbered as &sect;201.57(f)(9)(ii) and (f)(9)(iii)), and has finalized
them without change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Proposed &sect;201.57(f)(9)(iii)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;201.57(f)(9)(iii) (renumbered as &sect;201.57(f)(9)(iv)) states, in part, that ``FDA may approve
a drug for pediatric use based on adequate and well-controlled studies in adults, with other information supporting
pediatric use. In such cases, the agency will have concluded that the course of the disease and the effects of the drugs
are sufficiently similar in children and adults to permit extrapolation from the adult data to children. The additional
information supporting pediatric use must include data on the pharmacokinetics of the drug in children for determination
of pediatric dosage. Other information, such as data from pharmacodynamic studies of the drug in children, controlled
or uncontrolled studies confirming the safety or effectiveness of the drug in children, pertinent premarketing
or postmarketing studies or experience, may be necessary to establish the applicability of the adult data to children.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. One comment said FDA should revise proposed &sect;201.57(f)(9)(iii) to indicate that pharmacokinetic data
are not mandatory in some situations. Another comment stated that pharmacokinetic data may not be the most appropriate
way to determine pediatric dosing because the differences in metabolism or in distribution in pediatric patients
may support dosing that will not necessarily be related to blood levels. Both comments stated that dosing for inhalation
products should not be based on pharmacokinetics.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another comment said that difficulties in obtaining informed consent, use of placebo controls, and obtaining adequate
blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis in pediatric patients are not serious impediments to performing studies
necessary for appropriate pediatric labeling. The comment said there is a well-established ethical structure within
which informed consent may be obtained and placebo controls used in the pediatric population, and that current technology
requires only very small blood samples for measurement of most compounds. According to the comment, the primary impediments
to doing adequate clinical trials in the pediatric population are the absence of a regulatory mandate and the existence
of economic disincentives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency recognizes that pharmacokinetic data are important sources of information, but may not always be the most
appropriate method for determining pediatric dosing schedules and may be infeasible, unnecessary, or insufficient.
Other types of data or experience may sometimes substitute for pharmacokinetic data, and other data or experience
in the pediatric population may be needed in addition to pharmacokinetic data. The agency has modified the rule to
state that the additional information supporting pediatric use must 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ordinarily
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 include data on the pharmacokinetics of the drug in the pediatric population for determination of pediatric dosage.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in response to comment 4 in section III.C. of this document, this rule does not create a new requirement
for pediatric studies, but the authority for requiring pediatric studies already exists. There are situations in
which data on safe and effective use in pediatric patients may be necessary for approval or for continued marketing
of a drug. Revised &sect;201.57(f)(9) does not create the requirement for pediatric studies, but is intended to encourage
the inclusion of more comprehensive labeling about pediatric use by permitting use of adult data in establishing
pediatric efficacy. Specifically, the rule allows the pediatric use statement to be based on adequate and well-controlled
studies in adults when additional information exists to show that the course of the disease and the effects of the drug
are sufficiently similar in adults and pediatric patients to permit extrapolation from the adult efficacy data to
pediatric populations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has, on its own initiative, amended proposed &sect;201.57(f)(9)(iii) to indicate that FDA's determination
whether the effects of a drug are sufficiently similar in adults and pediatric patients will include an examination
of the drug's beneficial and adverse effects. FDA has also amended &sect;201.57(f)(9)(iii) to make clear that other
information besides pharmacokinetic data may be necessary not simply to ``establish the applicability of the adult
data to pediatric patients,'' but, more generally, ``to show that the drug can be used safely and effectively in pediatric
patients.'' Section 201.57(f)(9)(iii) has also been modified to remove any potential misimpression that uncontrolled
studies could demonstrate effectiveness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. One comment questioned the rule's language about extrapolating adult data to pediatric patients. The comment
said that the exact mechanism by which many psychiatric drugs work is not known, so that, for these drug products, extrapolation
between adult and pediatric populations may be inaccurate and potentially hazardous. The comment noted that randomized
controlled studies of tricyclic antidepressants in pediatric patients have raised questions regarding efficacy,
while safety issues have been raised based on noncontrolled data indicating a potential risk, which might not have
been clear based on adult data, of sudden cardiac death in pediatric patients using tricyclics.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA agrees that extrapolation from adult experience is inappropriate, and thus unacceptable, in some cases. Extrapolation
is not necessary under the rule, but is an alternative to the conduct of adequate and well-controlled studies in pediatric
patients. In those cases where the pediatric use statement is based primarily on adequate and well-controlled studies
in adults, additional information supporting pediatric use is usually needed, ordinarily including data on the
pharmacokinetics of the drug in the pediatric population for determination of pediatric dosage. Other information,
such as data from pharmacodynamic studies of the drug in pediatric patients, data from other studies supporting the
safety or effectiveness of the drug in pediatric patients, pertinent premarketing or postmarketing studies or experience,
may be necessary to show that the drug can be used safely and effectively in the pediatric population.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. One comment said that the preamble to the final regulation should clarify that ``other information'' supporting
pediatric use in proposed &sect;201.57(f)(9)(iii) need not be limited to data developed or sponsored by the NDA holder,
but may include data such as reports of studies by academic researchers in peer-review journals that were prepared
by persons who are not related to the NDA sponsor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes that no change is needed in revised &sect;201.57(f)(9)(iv) because the section does not suggest
that the data must have been developed or sponsored by the NDA holder.

change.

E. Proposed &sect;201.57(f)(9)(v)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;201.57(f)(9)(v) (renumbered as &sect;201.57(f)(9)(vi)) provides, in part, that ``[i]f the requirements
for a finding of substantial evidence to support a pediatric indication or a pediatric use statement have not been
met for any pediatric population, this subsection of the labeling shall contain the following statement: `Safety
and effectiveness in children have not been established.''' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18. One comment expressed concern that this provision may create disincentives for sponsors to develop better information
on pediatric use of their drugs. The comment suggested that FDA require mandatory phased-in safety testing and appropriate
clinical studies of pharmaceuticals in the pediatric population. Alternatively, the comment recommended that
FDA and manufacturers work to develop agreements whereby the manufacturer consents to carry out additional postapproval
pediatric studies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA believes that the comment suggests actions beyond the scope of this rule. FDA encourages pediatric testing, and,
as discussed in comment 4 in section III.C. of this document, has the authority to require pediatric studies. In some
cases, FDA will require pediatric studies for approval or continued marketing. This rule, however, does not add new
requirements for pediatric studies, but rather describes the kind of data that can be used to support labeling claims.

F. Proposed &sect;201.57(f)(9)(vi)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;201.57(f)(9)(vi) (renumbered as &sect;201.57(f)(9)(vii)) provides ``[i]f the sponsor believes
that none of the statements described in paragraphs (f)(9)(i) through (f)(9)(v) (renumbered as (f)(9)(ii) through
(f)(9)(vi)) of this section is appropriate or relevant to the labeling of a particular drug, the sponsor shall provide
reasons for omission of the statements and may propose alternative statement(s). FDA may permit use of an alternative
statement.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
19. One comment asserted that the proposal did not adequately address the problem of a large number of drugs that have
been approved and marketed for years without pediatric usage information in their labeling, which are widely used
in pediatric patients and for which there is substantial published literature regarding their pediatric use. The
comment noted that proposed &sect;201.57(f)(9)(vi) would impose on the sponsor the responsibility for providing
information that would promote the safe and effective use of prescription drugs in pediatric patients and noted that
the sponsor may have complex reasons for not necessarily wanting to include pediatric information in the labeling.
The comment recommended that the final rule include a mechanism that would allow summary information from authoritative
published literature to be added to the labeling of currently marketed drugs so this information would be available
to the pediatric prescriber. It suggested that the rule should provide an option permitting ``recognized authoritative
medical experts or groups of experts'' to provide information to support pediatric information in the labeling in
lieu of the sponsor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another comment urged the agency to provide for the incorporation of supplemental indications into drug labeling
based solely on information submitted by persons other than the sponsor. The comment said that changes should be made
based on studies reported in peer-reviewed medical literature, rather than relying on submissions by the sponsor.
The comment stated that this was necessary to make the labeling of certain drugs, particularly anticancer agents,
conform to the current state of medical knowledge. The comment noted that FDA restricts promotion of off-label uses,
and third-party payers often take the position that agents that have no labeled indication for treatment of cancers
in pediatric patients are experimental and therefore nonreimbursable, even though they may be safe and effective.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The sponsor is primarily responsible for bringing forth evidence to support labeling changes. A third party could,
however, provide evidence to persuade the agency to direct the sponsor to submit a labeling supplement. A study need
not have been conducted by or on behalf of the sponsor in order to support a labeling change. The evidence to support
labeling should continue to be of the type and quality that would ordinarily support labeling statements. Published
literature on pediatric use may contribute to this evidence, and authoritative groups may suggest approaches, but
the views of authoritative groups do not themselves represent sufficient evidence of effectiveness. With respect
to the comment concerning reimbursements, the agency advises that reimbursements to patients are beyond the scope
of the rule and FDA authority. However, FDA agrees with the underlying concern that appropriate indications be on
the label so that practitioners understand how best to prescribe the drug for the patient's medical benefit.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
G. Proposed &sect;201.57(f)(9)(vii)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;201.57(f)(9)(vii) (renumbered as &sect;201.57(f)(9)(viii)) states ``[i]f the drug product contains
one or more excipients that present an increased risk of toxic effects to neonates or other pediatric subgroups, a
special note of this risk, generally in the `Contraindications,' `Warnings,' or `Precautions' section, shall be
made.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20. Four comments expressed concern about this proposed requirement. One comment said that the data relating to the
toxicity of excipients, including preservatives, are inconclusive, making the requirement inappropriate. The
comment stated that FDA should encourage collection and analysis of data to enable specific determinations on the
use of excipients and preservatives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another comment asked FDA to clarify whether the proposed requirement that labeling contain statements about excipients
that present an increased risk of adverse effects to the neonate or other pediatric subgroups was intended to reflect
published literature or to be based on studies designed to show whether an increased risk exists. It added that it was
not clear how or by whom a determination of increased risk would be established. The comment suggested that the final
rule state that a sponsor can rely on existing information and is not required to conduct additional studies. The comment
also suggested that, if additional studies were necessary, animal data be used rather than requiring clinical studies
in neonates. It suggested that a standardized list could be developed jointly by industry and FDA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A third comment suggested that a requirement that any labeling identify any increased risk of toxic effects to neonates
or other pediatric groups should not be interpreted as establishing a requirement that sponsors conduct toxicology
or other studies to identify or quantify such risks. The comment also stated that the preamble to the final regulation
should state whether the increased risk of toxic effects is limited to those established by human data or experience,
or would also include those based on animal or in vitro models.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A fourth comment noted that ANDA holders may use excipients different from those used by the reference listed drug.
The comment suggested that ANDA holders should be required to provide specific information regarding excipients
used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule requires the labeling for a drug product containing one or more inactive ingredients that present an
increased risk of toxic effects to neonates or other pediatric subgroups to note such risks in the ``Contraindications,''
``Warnings,'' or ``Precautions'' section of the labeling. If toxicity data for the inactive ingredient(s) do not
exist or are inconclusive, revised &sect;201.57(f)(9)(viii) would not require the labeling to contain a statement
about an increased risk to neonates or other pediatric subgroups. However, in such cases, FDA encourages applicants
to collect and analyze data on inactive ingredients and preservatives that could represent a pediatric risk. These
data may include human data, animal data, or data derived from in vitro models.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA also notes that current regulations already require ANDA applicants whose inactive ingredients differ from
those used in the reference listed drug to identify and characterize the inactive ingredients in a proposed drug product
and to provide information demonstrating that such inactive ingredients do not affect the safety of the proposed
drug product (see 21 CFR 314.94(a)(9)). Given these provisions, there is no reason to believe that the inactive ingredients
used in a generic drug product are any less safe than those in the reference listed drug.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has determined that, for the purposes of this final rule, the terms ``excipient'' and ``inactive ingredient''
have the same meaning. However, because the agency generally uses the term ``inactive ingredient,'' the agency has,
on its own initiative, amended proposed &sect;201.57(f)(9)(vii) to refer to ``inactive ingredients'' instead
of ``excipients.''

V. Legal Authority
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA's revision to the ``Pediatric use'' subsection of prescription drug labeling is authorized by the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) and by the Public Health Service Act (the PHS act). Section 502(a) of the act prohibits
false or misleading labeling of drugs, including, under section 201(n) of the act, failure to reveal material facts
relating to potential consequences under customary conditions of use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 502(f) of the act requires drug labeling to have adequate directions for use and adequate warnings against
use by the pediatric population where its use may be dangerous to health, as well as adequate warnings against unsafe
dosage or methods or duration of administration, as are necessary to protect users. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 502(j) of the act prohibits use of drugs that are dangerous to health when used in the manner suggested in their
labeling. Drug products that do not meet the requirements of any paragraph of section 502 of the act are deemed to be
misbranded.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the misbranding provisions, the premarket approval provisions of the act authorize FDA to require
that prescription drug labeling provide the practitioner with adequate information to permit safe and effective
use of the drug product. Under section 505 of the act, FDA will approve an NDA only if the drug is shown to be both safe and
effective for its intended use under the conditions set forth in the drug's labeling. Section 701(a) of the act (21
U.S.C. 371(a)) authorizes FDA to issue regulations for the efficient enforcement of the act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under &sect;201.100(d) (21 CFR 201.100(d)) of FDA's labeling regulations, prescription drug products must bear
labeling that contains adequate information under which licensed practitioners can use the drug safely for their
intended uses. Section 201.57 describes specific categories of information, including information for drug use
in selected subgroups of the general population, which must be present to meet the requirements of &sect;201.100.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, under 21 CFR 314.125, FDA will not approve an NDA unless, among other things, there is adequate safety
and effectiveness information for the labeled uses and the product labeling complies with the requirements of part
201 (21 CFR part 201). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 351 of the PHS act provides legal authority for the agency to regulate the labeling and shipment of biological
products. Licenses for biological products are to be issued only upon a showing that they meet standards ``designed
to insure the continued safety, purity, and potency of such products'' prescribed in regulations (42 U.S.C. 262(d)).
The ``potency'' of a biological product includes its effectiveness (21 CFR 600.3(s)). Section 351(b) of the PHS act
prohibits false labeling of a biological product. FDA's regulations in part 201 apply to all prescription drug products,
including biological products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A drug product that is not in compliance with &sect;201.57(f)(9) would be considered misbranded and an unapproved
new drug under the act. A noncomplying product that is a biological product would, in addition, be considered falsely
labeled and an unlicensed biological product under the PHS act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. Implementation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The primary purpose of the proposed rule was to revise the existing pediatric labeling requirements by expanding
the basis on which information about use of a drug in the pediatric population may be included. The proposed rule would
have required sponsors to comply with the pediatric use provisions 1 year after the date of publication of a final rule
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
21. Several comments said that the proposed 1-year implementation period was too short. The comments claimed that
extrapolating and reviewing data would be time consuming and that the agency would be unable to approve pediatric
use labeling within 1 year. The comments suggested that the agency cooperate with industry to establish a 3&hyph;year
implementation schedule, only require sponsors to submit revised labeling in 1 year, or make the rule effective in
2 years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has carefully considered the comments and has revised the implementation schedule for the final rule.
The agency will accept pediatric use information based on revised &sect;201.57(f)(9) after January 12, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sponsors have a continuing obligation to maintain labeling that is truthful and comprehensive in accordance with
&sect;201.57, including &sect;201.57(f)(9). Section 201.57(f)(9) requires labeling to contain at least one of
the statements under &sect;201.57(f)(9)(ii) through (f)(9)(vi), or to propose an alternative statement under
&sect;201.57(f)(9)(vii). The statement must accurately describe available data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sponsors must, therefore, reexamine existing data to determine whether the ``Pediatric use'' subsection of the
labeling can be modified based on adequate and well-controlled studies in adults and other information supporting
pediatric use, and, if appropriate, submit a supplemental application to comply with new &sect;201.57(f)(9)(iv)
by December 13, 1996. A sponsor who does not believe that the disease and drug effects are similar in the pediatric and
adult populations, or who believes that use in pediatric patients is otherwise not adequately supported by data,
should not propose revised labeling under new &sect;201.57(f)(9)(iv), and need not inform the agency of this conclusion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, FDA expects sponsors to examine available information and update pediatric labeling for their products,
if appropriate. Sponsors should also examine data on the extent and nature of use of their products in pediatric patients.
If FDA concludes that a particular drug is widely used, represents a safety hazard, or is therapeutically important
in the pediatric population, and the drug sponsor has not submitted any pediatric use information, then the agency
may require that the sponsor develop and/or submit pediatric use information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If FDA has made a specific request for the submission of pediatric use information because of expected or identified
pediatric use, and the sponsor fails to provide such information, the agency may consider the product to be a misbranded
drug under section 502 of the act, or a falsely labeled biological product under section 351 of the PHS Act, as well as
an unapproved new drug or unlicensed biological product. (See 21 U.S.C. 355 and 42 U.S.C. 262). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the final rule, any new or revised pediatric indications, or statements on pediatric indications, or statements
on pediatric use under the provisions of &sect;201.57(f)(9)(ii) through (f)(9)(iv) would require FDA approval
of a supplemental application in accordance with &sect;314.70(b) or &sect;601.12. Other changes to proposed &sect;201.57(f)(9)(ii)
through (f)(9)(iv) to add or strengthen precautions, contraindications, warnings, or adverse reactions or to add
or strengthen dosage and administration instructions to increase a product's safety (for products other than biological
products) could be put into effect at the time a supplement covering the change is submitted to FDA in accordance with
&sect;314.70(c). Minor editorial changes to products other than biological products may be made in accordance with
&sect;314.70(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To comply with this rule, references to ``children'' in the ``Pediatric use'' subsection of the insert labeling of
products already being marketed must be changed, where appropriate, to ``Pediatric population'' or ``pediatric
patients.'' The agency advises that after January 12, 1995, such changes must be made, no later than the first time
that labeling is sent to the printers or ordered for reprinting to replenish old stocks of labeling. Such changes for
products other than biological products are considered minor editorial changes and may be submitted in an annual
report in accordance with &sect;314.70(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Any new or revised statement under &sect;201.57(f)(9)(viii) regarding inactive ingredients that may be toxic to
the neonate or other pediatric subgroup should be made in accordance with the provisions of &sect;314.70(c) or &sect;601.12
(21 CFR 601.12), as appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All supplements containing pediatric use information and their mailing covers should be plainly marked ``Pediatric
supplements.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For those products subject to section 351 of the PHS act, labeling changes should be made in accordance with &sect;601.12.
Persons who have questions regarding such changes and need guidance on whether a supplement is necessary should contact
one of the following three divisions as appropriate: Office of Therapeutics Research and Review, Division of Application
Review and Policy (HFM&hyph;585), 301&hyph;594&hyph;5109; Office of Vaccine Research and Review, Division of
Vaccine and Related Product Applications (HFM&hyph;475), 301&hyph;594&hyph;2090; or Office of Blood Research
and Review, Division of Blood Applications (HFM&hyph;370), 301&hyph;594&hyph;2012; at the following address:
Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, 1401 Rockville Pike, suite 200N, Rockville,
MD 20852.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22. One comment suggested that the rule would have a substantial economic impact, particularly if the agency adheres
to the proposed 1-year implementation period. The comment said that there are cost factors arising from the extensive
resources required to reevaluate the available clinical study data and literature to extrapolate adult safety data
to the pediatric age group or groups. The comment noted that drug studies in pediatric patients have additional costs
not experienced with the adult population, and may, in some cases, require inpatient studies. The comment also claimed
that encouraging pediatric studies prior to approval or as a Phase 4 commitment could lengthen the development process,
slow drug approval, and thereby have an additional economic impact.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has considered the comment and has revised the implementation schedule for this final rule. The implementation
schedule is discussed in section VI. of this document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency stresses that this rule does not require sponsors to conduct pediatric studies. The authority to require
studies is found in the act and regulations already promulgated. Rather, this rule recognizes alternative methods
of establishing substantial evidence to support pediatric labeling claims. Where a finding of substantial evidence
to support a pediatric indication or a pediatric use statement has not been met for a specific subgroup or for any pediatric
population, the sponsor must instead indicate that no data are available. If a sponsor believes that a pediatric use
statement would be inappropriate or irrelevant to the labeling of a particular drug, it must provide a reason for omitting
the statement. This rule does not affect any determination by the agency that pediatric studies are needed before
or after approval for a new drug.

VII. Environmental Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(a)(8) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VIII. Analysis of Impacts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has examined the impacts of the final rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.
L. 96&hyph;354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory
alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including
potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and
equity). The agency believes that this final rule is consistent with the principles set out in the Executive Order.
In addition, the final rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined by the Executive Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze regulatory options that would minimize any significant
impact of a rule on small entities. Because the final rule does not impose additional requirements for sponsors to
conduct pediatric studies, the agency certifies that the final rule will not have a significant economic impact on
a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, no further analysis is
required.

(9) Pediatric use:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Pediatric population(s)/pediatric patient(s): For the purposes of paragraphs (f)(9)(ii) through (f)(9)(viii)
of this setion, the terms ``pediatric population(s)'' and ``pediatric patient(s)'' are defined as the pediatric
age group, from birth to 16 years, including age groups often called neonates, infants, children, and adolescents.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If there is a specific pediatric indication (i.e., an indication different from those approved for adults) that
is supported by adequate and well-controlled studies in the pediatric population, it shall be described under the
``Indications and Usage'' section of the labeling, and appropriate pediatric dosage information shall be given
under the ``Dosage and Administration'' section of the labeling. The ``Pediatric use'' subsection shall cite any
limitations on the pediatric indication, need for specific monitoring, specific hazards associated with use of
the drug in any subsets of the pediatric population (e.g., neonates), differences between pediatric and adult responses
to the drug, and other information related to the safe and effective pediatric use of the drug. Data summarized in this
subsection of the labeling should be discussed in more detail, if appropriate, under the ``Clinical Pharmacology''
or ``Clinical Studies'' section. As appropriate, this information shall also be contained in the ``Contraindications,''
``Warnings,'' and elsewhere in the ``Precautions'' sections.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If there are specific statements on pediatric use of the drug for an indication also approved for adults that
are based on adequate and well-controlled studies in the pediatric population, they shall be summarized in the ``Pediatric
use'' subsection of the labeling and discussed in more detail, if appropriate, under the ``Clinical Pharmacology''
and ``Clinical Studies'' sections. Appropriate pediatric dosage shall be given under the ``Dosage and Administration''
section of the labeling. The ``Pediatric use'' subsection of the labeling shall also cite any limitations on the pediatric
use statement, need for specific monitoring, specific hazards associated with use of the drug in any subsets of the
pediatric population (e.g., neonates), differences between pediatric and adult responses to the drug, and other
information related to the safe and effective pediatric use of the drug. As appropriate, this information shall also
be contained in the ``Contraindications,'' ``Warnings,'' and elsewhere in the ``Precautions'' sections.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) FDA may approve a drug for pediatric use based on adequate and well-controlled studies in adults, with other information
supporting pediatric use. In such cases, the agency will have concluded that the course of the disease and the effects
of the drug, both beneficial and adverse, are sufficiently similar in the pediatric and adult populations to permit
extrapolation from the adult efficacy data to pediatric patients. The additional information supporting pediatric
use must ordinarily include data on the pharmacokinetics of the drug in the pediatric population for determination
of appropriate dosage. Other information, such as data from pharmacodynamic studies of the drug in the pediatric
population, data from other studies supporting the safety or effectiveness of the drug in pediatric patients, pertinent
premarketing or postmarketing studies or experience, may be necessary to show that the drug can be used safely and
effectively in pediatric patients. When a drug is approved for pediatric use based on adequate and well-controlled
studies in adults with other information supporting pediatric use, the ``Pediatric use'' subsection of the labeling
shall contain either the following statement, or a reasonable alternative: ``The safety and effectiveness of (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
drug name
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) have been established in the age groups _ to _ (note any limitations, e.g., no data for pediatric patients under 2,
or only applicable to certain indications approved in adults). Use of (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
drug name
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
drug name
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) in adults with additional data (insert wording that accurately describes the data submitted to support a finding
of substantial evidence of effectiveness in the pediatric population).'' Data summarized in the preceding prescribed
statement in this subsection of the labeling shall be discussed in more detail, if appropriate, under the ``Clinical
Pharmacology'' or the ``Clinical Studies'' section. For example, pediatric pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic
studies and dose-response information should be described in the ``Clinical Pharmacology'' section. Pediatric
