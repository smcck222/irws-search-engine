Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On May 16, 1994, Heli-Dyne Systems, Inc., Hurst, Texas, applied for a Supplemental Type Certificate for installation
of an Electronic Flight Instrument System in the Bell Helicopter Textron (BHTI) Model 222U helicopter. This model
helicopter is a 10 passenger, 2 engine, 8,250 pound (Category B) or 7,850 pound (Category A) transport category helicopter.

Type Certification Basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The certification basis established for the BHTI Model 22U helicopter includes: 14 CFR 21.29 and part 29 of the Federal
Aviation Regulations (FAR) effective February 1, 1965 (Transport Categories A and B), Amendments 29&hyph;1 through
29&hyph;9; Amendment 29&hyph;11; &sect;29.997 of Amendment 29&hyph;10; &sect;29.927(b)(2) of Amendment 29&hyph;17;
&sect;&sect;29.801, 29.25(c) 29.865, 29.1557(c), and 29.1555(c) of Amendment 29.12; &sect;&sect;29.1, 29.79,
29.1517, and 29.1587 of Amendment 29&hyph;21; Criteria for Helicopter Instrument Flight Rule (IFR) certification
dated December 15, 1978; Exemption No. 2789, &sect;29.811(h)(1) (following Amendment 24, effective December 6,
1984, &sect;29.811(h)(1) became &sect;29.811(f)(2)); and Exemption No. 4395, &sect;29.855(a) and portions of
&sect;29.855(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the Administration finds that the applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate
safety standards for these helicopters because of a novel or unusual design feature, special conditions are prescribed
under the provisions of &sect;21.16 to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established in the regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Special conditions, as appropriate, are issued in accordance with &sect;11.49 of the FAR after public notice, as
required by &sect;&sect;11.28 and 11.29(b), and become part of the type certification basis in accordance with &sect;21.101(b)(2).

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The BHTI Model 222U helicopter, at the time of the application for modification by Heli-Dyne Systems, Inc., was identified
as incorporating one and possibly more electrical, electronic, or combination of electrical and electronic (electrical/electronic)
systems that will perform functions critical to the continued safe flight and landing of the helicopters. The electronic
flight instrument system performs the attitude display function. The display of attitude, altitude, and airspeed
is critical to the continued safe flight and landing of the helicopters for IFR operations in instrument meteorological
conditions. After the design is finalized, Heli-Dyne Systems, Inc., will provide the FAA with a preliminary hazard
that will identify any other critical functions performed by the electrical/electronic systems that are critical
to the continued safe flight and landing of the helicopters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recent advances in technology have prompted the design of aircraft that include advanced electrical and electronic
systems that perform functions required for continued safe flight and landing. However, these advanced systems
respond to the transient effects of induced electrical current and voltage caused by the high intensity radiated
fields (HIRF) incident on the external surface of the helicopters. These induced transient currents and voltages
can degrade the performance of the electrical/electronic systems by damaging the components or by upsetting the
systems' functions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the electromagnetic environment has undergone a transformation not envisioned by the current application
of &sect;29.1309(a). Higher energy levels radiate from operational transmitters currently used for radar, radio,
and television; the number of transmitters has increased significantly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing aircraft certification requirements are inappropriate in view of these technological advances. In addition,
the FAA has received reports of some significant safety incidents and accidents involving military aircraft equipped
with advanced electrical/electronic systems when they were exposed to electromagnetic radiation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The combined effects of technological advances in helicopter design and the changing environment have resulted
in an increased level of vulnerability of the electrical and electronic systems required for the continued safe flight
and landing of the helicopters. Effective measures to protect these helicopters against the adverse effects of exposure
of HIRF will be provided by the design and installation of these systems. The following primary factors contributed
to the current conditions: (1) Increased use of sensitive electronics that perform critical functions, (2) reduced
electromagnetic shielding afforded helicopter systems by advanced technology airframe materials, (3) adverse
service experience of military aircraft using these technologies, and (4) an increase in the number and power of radio
frequency emitters and the expected increase in the future.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA recognizes the need for aircraft certification standards to keep pace with technological developments and
a changing environment and, in 1986, initiated a high priority program to (1) determine and define electromagnetic
energy levels; (2) develop guidance material for design, test, and analysis; and (3) prescribe and promulgate regulatory
standards. The FAA participated with industry and airworthiness authorities of other countries to develop internationally
recognized standards for certification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA and airworthiness authorities of other countries have identified a level of HIRF environment that a helicopter
could be exposed to during IFR operations. While the HIRF requirements are being finalized, the FAA is adopting a special
condition for the certification of aircraft that employ electrical/electronic systems that perform critical functions.
The accepted maximum energy levels that civilian helicopter system installations must withstand for safe operation
are based on surveys and analysis of existing radio frequency emitters. This special condition will require the helicopters'
electrical/electronic systems and associated wiring to be protected from these energy levels. These external threat
levels are believed to represent the worst-case exposure for a helicopter operating under IFR.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The HIRF environment specified in this proposed special condition is based on many critical assumptions. With the
exception of takeoff and landing at an airport, one of these assumptions is the aircraft would be not less than 500 feet
above ground level (AGL). Helicopters operating under visual flight rules (VFR) routinely operate at less than 500
feet AGL and perform takeoffs and landings at locations other than controlled airports. Therefore, it would be expected
that the HIRF environment experienced by a helicopter operating VFR may exceed the defined environment by 100 percent
or more.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This special condition will require the systems that perform critical functions, as installed in the aircraft, to
meet certain standards based on either a defined HIRF environment or a fixed value using laboratory tests.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The applicant may demonstrate that the operation and operational capability of the installed electrical/electronic
systems that perform critical functions are not adversely affected when the aircraft is exposed to the defined HIRF
environment. The FAA has determined that the environment defined in Table 1 is acceptable for critical functions
in helicopters operating at or above 500 feet AGL. For critical functions of helicopters operating at less than 500
feet AGL, additional factors must be considered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The applicant may also demonstrate by a laboratory test that the electrical/electronic systems that perform critical
functions can withstand a peak electromagnetic field strength in a frequency range of 10 KH
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
Z
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 to 18 GH
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If a laboratory test is used to show compliance with the defined HIRF environment, no credit will be given for signal
attenuation due to installation. A level of 100 v/m and other considerations, such as an alternate technology backup
that is immune to HIRF, are appropriate for critical functions during IFR operations. A level of 200 v/m and further
considerations, such as an alternate technology backup that is immune to HIRF, are more appropriate for critical
functions during VFR operations.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants must perform a preliminary hazard analysis to identify electrical/electronic systems that perform
critical functions. The term ``critical'' means those functions whose failure would contribute to or cause a failure
condition that would prevent the continued safe flight and landing of the helicopters. The systems identified by
the hazard analysis as performing critical functions are required to have HIRF protection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A system may perform both critical and noncritical functions. Primary electronic flight display systems and their
associated components perform critical functions such as attitude, altitude, and airspeed indications. HIRF requirements
would apply only to the systems that perform critical functions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compliance with HIRF requirements will be demonstrated by tests, analysis, models, similarity with existing systems,
or a combination of these methods. The two basic options of either testing the rotorcraft to the defined environment
or laboratory testing may not be combined. The laboratory test allows some frequency areas to be under tested and requires
other areas to have some safety margin when compared to the defined environment. The areas required to have some safety
margin are those that have been, by past testing, shown to exhibit greater susceptibility to adverse effects from
HIRF; and laboratory tests, in general, do not accurately represent the aircraft installation. Service experience
alone will not be acceptable since such experience in normal flight operations may not include an exposure to HIRF.
Reliance on a system with similar design features for redundancy, as a means of protection against the effects of external
HIRF, is generally insufficient because all elements of a redundant system are likely to be concurrently exposed
to the radiated fields.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The modulation that represents the signal most likely to disrupt the operation of the system under test, based on its
design characteristics, should be selected. For example, flight control systems may be susceptible to 3 H
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
Z
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 square wave modulation while the video signals for electronic display systems may be susceptible to 400 H
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 sinusoidal modulation. If the worst-case modulation is unknown or cannot be determined, default modulations may
be used. Suggested default values are a 1 KH

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

 and 1 KH

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. For frequencies where the unmodulated signal would cause deviations from normal operation, several different
modulating signals with various waveforms and frequencies should be applied.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Acceptable system performance would be attained by demonstrating that the critical function components of the system
under consideration continue to perform their intended function during and after exposure to required electromagnetic
fields. Deviations from system specifications may be acceptable but must be independently assessed by the FAA on
a case-by-case basis.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Airbus Model
A320 series airplanes. This proposal would require modification of the trimmable horizontal stabilizer (THS).
This proposal is prompted by a report of leakage from some of the hydraulic pipe fittings after a lightning strike.
The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent such leakage from hydraulic pipe fittings, which
could result in the loss of the pilot's ability to control the moveable surfaces of the THS.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France,
recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Airbus Model A320 series airplanes. The DGAC
advises that one operator found leakage from some of the hydraulic pipe fittings on one airplane after a lightning
strike. Investigation revealed that the electrical bonding of the hydraulic pipe fittings and actuator servo control
units of the trimmable horizontal stabilizer (THS) has insufficient protection from a lightning strike. This condition,
if not corrected, could result in the loss of the pilot's ability to control the moveable surfaces of the THS, which
could adversely affect the controllability of the airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Airbus has issued Service Bulletin A320&hyph;29&hyph;1058, dated July 16, 1993, which describes procedures for
modification of the THS. This modification involves installing bonding leads across all return hydraulic pipe fittings
in the THS area and across the actuator return line elbows. This modification also involves replacing the existing
clamps with items of increased electrical conductivity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Airbus has also issued Service Bulletin A320&hyph;27&hyph;1041, Revision 2, dated April 20, 1994, which describes
procedures for modification of the THS. This modification involves installing bonding plates and leads between
the elevator and the THS, and bonding leads between the actuator bodies and the THS bonding strip. This modification
also connects bonding leads to the return hydraulic pipes across all the fittings in the THS area.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accomplishment of both of these modifications will improve the electrical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bonding protection on the THS. The DGAC classified these service bulletins as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandatory and issued French AD 93&hyph;123&hyph;046 (B), dated August 4, 1993, in order to assure the continued airworthiness
of these airplanes in France. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation in the United States under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29)
and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the
DGAC has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the DGAC, reviewed
all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated
for operation in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require modification of the THS. The actions would be
required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, the FAA has learned that,
in general, some operators may misunderstand the legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability
provision of the AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. The FAA points out that all
airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally subject to the AD. If an airplane has been
altered or repaired in the affected area in such a way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required
to obtain FAA approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the paragraph of each
AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been included in this notice to clarify this requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 99 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
13 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour.
Required parts would be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to the operators. Based on these figures, the total
cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $77,220, or $780 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Airbus Model
A320&hyph;111, &hyph;211, and &hyph;212 series airplanes. This proposal would require modification of the junction
box and connector backshells of a certain electrical harness assembly. This proposal is prompted by a report that
traces of fungus and corrosion have been found on the electrical harness junction box of the thrust reverser. The actions
specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent such corrosion, which could result in multiple faults in the thrust
reverser position indication, and subsequent uncontrolled reduction of engine power.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France,
recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Airbus Model A320&hyph;111, &hyph;211, and
&hyph;212 series airplanes powered by CFM 56&hyph;5A engines equipped with an electrical harness assembly having
part number (P/N) 238W0908&hyph;513. The DGAC advises it has received a report indicating that traces of fungus and
corrosion have been found on the electrical harness junction box (transition box) of the thrust reverser. Investigation
revealed that moisture ingressed into the electrical harness junction box and associated wiring. The effects of
such moisture subsequently could corrode the electrical harness junction box. This condition, if not detected and
corrected in a timely manner, could result in multiple faults in the thrust reverser position indication, and subsequent
uncontrolled reduction of engine power. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Airbus has issued Service Bulletin A320&hyph;71&hyph;1011, dated November 17, 1993, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which describes procedures for modification of the junction box and connector backshells of the electrical harness
assembly having P/N 238W0908&hyph;513. This modification involves sealing the junction box, replacing the existing
aluminum backshells with stainless steel backshells, and checking the insulation of the electrical harness. The
DGAC classified this service bulletin as mandatory and issued French AD 94&hyph;030&hyph;050(B), dated February
2, 1994, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation in the United States under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29)
and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the
DGAC has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the DGAC, reviewed
all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated
for operation in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require modification of the junction box and connector
backshells of the electrical harness assembly of the thrust reverser. The actions would be required to be accomplished
in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, the FAA has learned that,
in general, some operators may misunderstand the legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability
provision of the AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. The FAA points out that all
airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally subject to the AD. If an airplane has been
altered or repaired in the affected area in such a way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required
to obtain FAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the paragraph of each AD that provides
for such approvals. A note has been included in this notice to clarify this requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 50 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
24 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour.
Required parts would be supplied by ROHR, Inc. (the manufacturer of the junction box, connector backshells, and the
electrical harness assembly) at no cost to the operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed
AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $72,000, or $1,440 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Fokker Model
F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes. This proposal would require replacement of the flight control lock (FCL) handle and
switch with a modified unit. This proposal is prompted by a report of sudden engagement of the FCL system during approach
for landing. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent inadvertent engagement of the FCL system
during flight and subsequent reduced controllability of the airplane.

Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Rijksluchtvaartdienst (RLD), which is the airworthiness authority for the Netherlands, recently notified
the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes. The RLD advises that
it received a report that the autothrottle system on a Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplane disengaged suddenly while
the airplane was on approach for landing. The thrust levers could not be moved, and the ailerons were blocked in the
``NEUTRAL'' position. After recycling the flight control lock (FCL) system to the ``UNLOCKED'' and ``LATCHED''
position, the thrust levers and ailerons were free to move again. The thrust levers are linked to the FCL system to prevent
takeoff revolutions per minute (RPM) from being selected if the FCL system is locked.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Investigation revealed that a takeoff configuration warning for the FCL system may not be generated, despite the
fact that the FCL handle is not in the ``UNLOCKED'' and ``LATCHED'' position. On some aircraft, the operating forces
then may be insufficient to drive the handle back into the ``UNLOCKED'' and ``LATCHED'' position, and the flight control
surface could lock unexpectedly during flight. This condition, if not corrected, could result in inadvertent engagement
of the FCL and subsequent reduced controllability of the airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fokker has issued Service Bulletin SBF100&hyph;27&hyph;051, Revision 1, dated May 6, 1994, which describes procedures
for replacement of the FCL handle and switch with a modified unit. Accomplishment of this installation will ensure
that a takeoff configuration warning for the FCL system is generated if the handle is not latched in the ``UNLOCKED''
position. The RLD classified this service bulletin as mandatory and issued Netherlands airworthiness directive
BLA No. 93&hyph;088 (A), dated July 12, 1993, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in
the Netherlands.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in the Netherlands and is type certificated for operation in the United States
under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral
airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the RLD has kept the FAA informed
of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the RLD, reviewed all available information,
and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in
the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require replacement of the FCL handle and switch with
a modified unit. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described
previously.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, the FAA has learned that,
in general, some operators may misunderstand the legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability
provision of the AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. The FAA points out that all
airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally subject to the AD. If an airplane has been
altered or repaired in the affected area in such a way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required
to obtain FAA approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the paragraph of each
AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been included in this notice to clarify this requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 75 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
3 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. Required
parts would cost approximately $1,000 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed
AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $88,500, or $1,180 per airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of the Treasury (``Department'') is proposing amendments to Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4, which is the
form that associated persons of financial institutions that are government securities brokers and dealers are required
to file with such financial institutions, pursuant to sections 15C(b)(1)(B) and (b)(4) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (the ``Exchange Act'') (15 U.S.C. 78
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
o
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
&hyph;5(b)(1)(B) and(b)(4)) and sections 400.4 and 449.3 of the regulations issued under the Government Securities
Act of 1986 (``GSA'').
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The amendments would update the disciplinary background provisions of the form to reflect amendments to the federal
securities laws, and would provide the financial institutions of the associated persons and the appropriate regulatory
authorities for the financial institutions with more useful information.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department adopted Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 (Disclosure Form for Person Associated with a Financial Institution
Government Securities Broker or Dealer) in the implementing regulations for the GSA issued on July 24, 1987 (52 FR
27910). Sections 400.4 and 449.3
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 of the GSA regulations require the form to be used by associated persons of financial institutions that are government
securities brokers and dealers to provide the financial institution and the appropriate regulatory agency with
certain information concerning employment, residence and statutory disqualification. Under the GSA regulations,
associated persons that have a current Form U&hyph;4 (Uniform Application for Securities Industry Registration
or Transfer) or Form MSD&hyph;4 (Uniform Application for Municipal Securities Principal or Municipal Securities
Representative Associated with a Bank Municipal Securities Dealer) on file with their financial institution are

The proposed changes to the body of Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 relate to Item 17, which requests information concerning
the disciplinary history of the associated person. The changes are being made to reflect amendments to the Exchange
Act by the Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990 (``Remedies Act'')
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 and the International Securities Enforcement Cooperation Act of 1990 (``ISECA'').
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 The Remedies Act gave the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'') the authority to seek civil monetary penalties
in court proceedings and to impose monetary penalties and order disgorgement in administrative proceedings. The
Remedies Act also provided the SEC with both temporary and permanent cease and desist order authority to prevent violations
of securities laws. The ISECA gave the SEC the authority to bar, suspend or restrict the activities of broker-dealers
and the associated persons or those persons seeking to become associated with a broker-dealer, based upon the findings
of a foreign court or foreign securities authority. By amending the GSA, the ISECA also gave similar authority to the
appropriate regulatory agencies for financial institutions that are government securities brokers or dealers
regarding associated persons or those persons seeking to become associated with such entities.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 The ISECA added a definition of the term ``foreign financial regulatory authority'' to section 3(a) of the Exchange
Act,
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 and provided that certain types of actions taken by foreign financial regulatory authorities will be deemed a statutory
disqualification.

Specifically, the amendments to Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 would amend question C of Item 17 to add paragraph (5), which
would ask the associated person whether the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC'') has ever imposed
a civil money penalty on the associated person, or ordered the associated person to cease and desist from any activity.
The new inquiry would require a yes or no response, and if the response is yes, details must be provided, as is currently
required for any affirmative response in Item 17. The disclosure of this additional information would correspond
to the SEC's expanded administrative and civil enforcement authorities under the Remedies Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendments to Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 would also add a definition of ``foreign financial regulatory authority''
to Item 17, and would add this term to question 17.D. Thus, question 17.D would now inquire whether any federal regulatory
agency, any state regulatory agency or ``foreign financial regulatory authority'' has ever found the associated
person to have: made a false statement or omission or been dishonest, unfair or unethical; been involved in a violation
of investment regulations or statutes; been the cause of an investment-related business having its authorization
to do business denied, suspended, revoked or restricted; been subject to an order concerning investment-related
activity; had its registration or license denied, suspended, or revoked, or otherwise been prevented from associating
with an investment-related business, or been disciplined by the restriction of its activities; or had its license
as an attorney, accountant or federal contractor suspended. The definition of ``foreign financial regulatory authority''
which would be added to Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 is essentially the definition the ISECA added to section 3(a)(52)
of the Exchange Act. Questions 17.A and 17.B would be amended to clarify that the inquiries now apply to information
related to foreign as well as domestic courts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendments would modify Item 5 to reflect the Office of Thrift Supervision as the successor to the Federal Home
Loan Bank Board. Thus, the ``Director, Office of Thrift Supervision'' would now be listed as one of the appropriate
regulatory agencies with which the financial institutions may be required to file the form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the technical changes made by the Government Securities Act Amendments of 1993 to the definition of ``appropriate
regulatory agency'',
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 these amendments would also make corresponding changes to Item 3 of the general instructions for Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4.

These amendments would ensure that Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 will provide a more complete description of the associated
person's disciplinary history. The amendments to Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 would also conform to similar changes
made by the National Association of Securities Dealers (``NASD'') to Form U&hyph;4 in November, 1991,
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 and by the SEC to Form BD (Uniform Application for Broker-Dealer Registration) in July, 1992.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 The Treasury was unable to propose amendments to Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 at the same time the NASD and SEC made changes
to their respective forms since its rulemaking authority under the GSA expired on October 1, 1991, and was not reauthorized
until December 17, 1993.

If the Department adopts the amendments to Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 as proposed, associated persons of financial
institutions that are government securities brokers or dealers would need to file amendments to their existing Form
G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 to the extent that any information is inaccurate or incomplete. Associated persons would need
to review their current Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 filings to determine whether the forms contain all the information
required by these amendments, and if not, the associated person would need to file an amendment to their G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4
with the updated information. An appropriate transition period would be provided for associated persons to file
any required updates.

II. Special Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the very limited impact of the proposed amendments, it is the Department's view that the proposed changes
to Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 are not a ``significant regulatory action'' for the purposes of Executive Order 12866.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), it is hereby certified that the amendments to Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4, if adopted, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities and, as a result, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The collection of information in these proposed amendments to Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 is contained in revised Items
5 and 17 of the form. Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 is required to be submitted by associated persons of financial institutions
that are government securities brokers and dealers, in accordance with &sect;&sect;400.4 and 449.3. The collection
of information is intended to give the financial institutions and the appropriate regulatory authorities of the
financial institutions a more complete and meaningful description of the disciplinary history of the associated
person. The rule applies only to associated persons of financial institutions that are not exempt from filing notice
as government securities brokers and dealers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Department is proposing to add a new paragraph to an existing question and modify several other questions
on Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4, and cannot be certain as to the exact impact on associated persons completing the form,
it does believe that the changes will not have more than a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 effect on the amount of time necessary to complete the form. The Department's most recent Paperwork Reduction Act
Filing with respect to Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 shows an annual estimate of 800 respondents filing once per year, with
a burden of two hours per respondent. No modification is projected to the reporting burden. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) requires that collections of information prescribed in proposed
rules be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review and approval. Since these proposed amendments
result in no increase in burden hours to complete Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 and more importantly do not represent any
program change, the submission described in the Paperwork Reduction Act is inapplicable.

conversion transaction may be netted for purposes of determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the amount of gain that is recharacterized as ordinary income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These proposed regulations reflect changes to the law made by the

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This document contains proposed amendments to the Income Tax 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations (26 CFR part 1) under section 1258(a) of the Internal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revenue Code of 1986. Section 1258 was added to the Code by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 13206(a) of the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1258 treats certain capital gains from conversion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transactions as ordinary income. A transaction is a conversion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transaction if substantially all of the taxpayer's expected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
return is attributable to the time value of the taxpayer's net 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investment in the transaction and the transaction falls within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one of four categories. The four categories of covered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transactions are (1) acquiring property and substantially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contemporaneously entering into a contract to sell that (or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantially identical) property, (2) applicable straddles, (3) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transactions marketed or sold as producing capital gains, and (4) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transactions specified in regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gain generated by any position of a conversion transaction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is treated as ordinary income to the extent of the applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imputed income amount (AIIA). The AIIA is equal to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxpayer's net investment in the transaction multiplied by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable rate, with certain adjustments. The applicable rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is generally 120 percent of the applicable Federal rate, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined as if the conversion transaction were a debt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instrument.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Explanation of Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Overview 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of section 1258 is to treat the time value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income from conversion transactions as ordinary income. Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1258(a) may create a character mismatch, however, because it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
focuses only on the gain recognized on the transaction. If a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxpayer separately disposes of the positions of a conversion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transaction, the taxpayer's inability to net losses on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
positions against gains could result in the recharacterization of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gain in excess of the time value element. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, assume that a taxpayer buys a capital asset for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$100 and simultaneously sells that asset forward for $105 in one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year. Assume that the AIIA is $8. If the asset were delivered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to close out the forward contract, the taxpayer would have a $5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capital gain. Even though the AIIA is $8, no more than the $5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gain would be recharacterized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assume, instead, that the taxpayer sells the asset and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closes out the forward contract in separate transactions when the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value of the asset has dropped to $97. Gain subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recharacterization under section 1258(a), determined separately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for each position, is $8 on the forward contract. If the $3 loss 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the asset were not netted against that $8 gain prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applying section 1258(a), the full $8 gain would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recharacterized as ordinary income. This recharacterization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would force the taxpayer to recognize $8 of ordinary income and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$3 of non-offsetting capital loss. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations provide relief from this potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
character mismatch in certain circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Specific Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations allow taxpayers to net gains and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
losses on the positions of certain conversion transactions for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes of section 1258(a). To be eligible, the taxpayer must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identify, before the close of the day on which the positions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
become part of the conversion transaction, all the positions that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are part of the conversion transaction. In addition, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxpayer must dispose of all the positions within a 14-day period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is within a single taxable year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations also provide special rules for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
losses on positions of conversion transactions. These rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevent the netting of built-in loss against gain. In addition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the rules treat certain losses that arise during the term of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conversion transaction as built-in losses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These regulations are proposed to be effective for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conversion transactions entered into on or after the date of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filing of the final regulations with the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Solicitation of Comments on Other Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The scope of the relief provided by the proposed regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be broadened if a taxpayer could elect to treat retained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
positions of a conversion transaction as if they were sold for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their fair market values whenever another position of that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transaction was disposed of, terminated, or treated as sold under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any other provision of the Code or regulations. The proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations do not include such a mark-to-market provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Marking positions to market raises a number of issues under other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of the Code (for example, sections 1271 through 1278). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service solicits comments on the necessity for and terms of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mark-to-market provision under section 1258. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service is aware that section 1258 presents a number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issues not addressed by the proposed regulations. The Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
invites comments concerning which, if any, of these issues should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be addressed in future regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Special Analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this notice of proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Internal Revenue Code, this notice of proposed rulemaking will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administration for comment on its impact on small business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments and Public Hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, consideration will be given to any written comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a signed original and eight (8) copies) that are submitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
timely to the IRS. All comments will be available for public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection and copying.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Purpose. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this section is to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxpayers with a method to net certain gains and losses from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
positions of the same conversion transaction before determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the amount of gain treated as ordinary income under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1258(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Netting of gain and loss for identified transactions_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a taxpayer disposes of or terminates all the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
positions of an identified netting transaction (as defined in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (b)(2) of this section) within a 14-day period in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
single taxable year, all gains and losses on those positions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
realized within that period (other than built-in losses as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined in paragraph (c) of this section) are netted solely for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes of determining the amount of gain treated as ordinary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income under section 1258(a). A taxpayer is treated as disposing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of any position that is treated as sold under any provision of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Code or regulations thereunder (for example, under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1256(a)(1)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Identified netting transaction. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section, an identified netting transaction is a conversion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transaction (as defined in section 1258(c)) that the taxpayer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identifies as an identified netting transaction on its books and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records. Identification of each position of the conversion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transaction must be made before the close of the day on which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
position becomes part of the conversion transaction. No 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular form of identification is necessary, but all the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
positions of a single conversion transaction must be identified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as part of the same transaction and must be distinguished from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all other positions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Definition of built-in loss. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section, built-in loss can arise in two situations. First, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
built-in loss as defined in section 1258(d)(3)(B) is built-in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loss. Second, if a taxpayer realizes gain or loss on any one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
position of a conversion transaction (for example, under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1256) and, as of the date that gain or loss is realized, there is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unrealized loss in any other position of the conversion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transaction that is not disposed of, terminated, or treated as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sold under any provision of the Code or regulations thereunder 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within 14 days of and within the same taxable year as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
realization event, that unrealized loss is built-in loss. See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Examples. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These examples illustrate this section:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 1. Identified netting transaction with simultaneous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actual dispositions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) On December 1, 1995, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
A
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 purchases 1,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shares of XYZ stock for $100,000 and enters into a forward 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contract to sell 1,000 shares of XYZ stock on November 30, 1997, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for $110,000. The XYZ stock is actively traded as defined in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;1.1092(d)-1(a) and is a capital asset in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
A
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
's hands. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
A
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintains books and records on which, on December 1, 1995, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identifies the two positions as all the positions of a single 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conversion transaction. A owns no other XYZ stock. On December 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1, 1996, when the applicable imputed income amount for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transaction is $7,000, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
A
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 sells the 1,000 shares of XYZ stock for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$95,000. On the same day, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
A
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 terminates its forward contract by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entering into an offsetting position, receiving $10,200. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The XYZ stock and forward contract are positions of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conversion transaction. Under section 1258(c)(1), substantially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all of A's expected return from the overall transaction is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attributable to the time value of the net investment in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transaction. Under section 1258(c)(2)(B), the transaction is an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable straddle as defined in section 1258(d)(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
A
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 disposed of or terminated all the positions of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conversion transaction within 14 days and within the same taxable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year as required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transaction is an identified netting transaction because it meets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the identification requirement of paragraph (b)(2) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section. Solely for purposes of section 1258(a), the $5,000 loss 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
realized ($100,000 basis less $95,000 amount realized) on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposition of the XYZ stock is netted against the $10,200 gain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognized on the disposition of the forward contract. Thus, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
net gain from the conversion transaction for purposes of section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1258(a) is $5,200 ($10,200 gain less $5,000 loss). Only the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$5,200 net gain is recharacterized as ordinary income under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1258(a) even though the applicable imputed income amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is $7,000. For federal tax purposes other than section 1258(a), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
A
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 has recognized a $10,200 gain on the disposition of the forward 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contract ($5,200 of which is treated as ordinary income) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
realized a separate $5,000 loss on the sale of the XYZ stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 2. Identified netting transaction with built-in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loss. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) The facts are the same as in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, except that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
A
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
had purchased the XYZ stock for $104,000 on May 15, 1995. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
XYZ stock had a fair market value of $100,000 on December 1, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1995, the date it became part of a conversion transaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The results are the same as in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, except that A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has built-in loss (in addition to the $5,000 loss that arose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economically during the period of the conversion transaction), as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined in section 1258(d)(3)(B), of $4,000 on the XYZ stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
That $4,000 built-in loss is not netted against the $10,200 gain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the forward contract for purposes of section 1258(a). Thus, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the net gain from the conversion transaction for purposes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1258(a) is $5,200, the same as in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. The $4,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
built-in loss is recognized and has a character determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without regard to section 1258. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 3. Identified netting transaction with position 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marked to market. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, a calendar year taxpayer, holds a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portfolio of Treasury securities that are capital assets in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hands. On December 1, 1995, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 enters into a short futures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contract on Treasury securities that is a regulated futures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contract (RFC) as defined in section 1256(g)(1). Although the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RFC and some portion of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
's portfolio of Treasury securities (the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conversion Treasuries) constitute a straddle as defined in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1092(c), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 does not make an election under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1256(d) to have section 1256 not apply to the RFC, nor does 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make any identification or election under &sect;1.1092(b)&hyph;3T or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;1.1092(b)&hyph;4T (relating to certain identified mixed straddles or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mixed straddle accounts, respectively). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 maintains books and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records on which, on December 1, 1995, it identifies the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conversion Treasuries and the RFC as all the positions of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
single conversion transaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) As of December 29, 1995, the last business day of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxable year, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 has an unrealized loss on the conversion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Treasuries of $8,000, wholly attributable to the period beginning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
December 1, 1995, and ending December 29, 1995, and an unrealized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gain on the RFC of $8,800. Under section 1256, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 marks the RFC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to market as of December 29, 1995. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 continues to hold the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conversion Treasuries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The conversion Treasuries and RFC are positions of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conversion transaction. Under section 1258(c)(1), substantially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
's expected return from the overall transaction is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attributable to the time value of the net investment in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transaction. Under section 1258(c)(2)(B), the transaction is an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable straddle as defined in section 1258(d)(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The transaction is an identified netting transaction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because it meets the identification requirement of paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(2) of this section. Paragraph (b)(1) of this section does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not apply to the transaction, however, because 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 did not dispose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of or terminate all the positions of the conversion transaction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the same 14-day period in the same taxable year. There 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has been no disposition or termination of the conversion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Treasuries by December 31, 1995, the end of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
's taxable year in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which it is treated as having sold the RFC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The $8,000 excess of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
's basis in the conversion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Treasuries over their fair market value on December 29, 1995, is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
built-in loss under paragraph (c) of this section. Under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, that $8,000 built-in loss is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not available to offset later gain on the positions.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(I) History and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Following publication of the NPRM on accident reporting in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 42880), FRA conducted a series of public hearings to obtain the industry's views and comments on specific issues
addressed in the NPRM. Public hearings were held in Washington, D.C. on October 5&hyph;6; in Kansas City, Missouri
on October 19; and in Portland, Oregon on November 3. FRA examined the issues and interests involved and made a preliminary
inquiry among the hearing participants to determine whether additional hearings or regulatory meetings could be
successful in narrowing areas of disagreement and exploring possible accommodations. Most participants expressed
interest in continuing the rulemaking process by holding additional or supplementary regulatory meetings, roundtables
or workshops. After further deliberation, FRA decided that an informal public regulatory conference would prove
advantageous in the development of the accident reporting regulations. FRA also believes that the quality of the
agency's final rule will be improved by facilitating an exchange of ideas that may lead to solutions acceptable to
all interested groups.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
(II) Methodology
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the public regulatory conference is a continuation of the accident reporting rulemaking proceeding. A court reporter
will take a verbatim transcript of the conference which will be placed in the public docket for this rulemaking. The
format of the discussions will be informal and will employ a topical, interactive approach. The public regulatory
conference is currently scheduled for one week. FRA believes the time allotted for this conference will prove more
than adequate. Of course, the conference will conclude earlier than initially planned if a majority of participants
in attendance agree that the key issues have been adequately addressed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
(III) Participants
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA invites all affected parties, including small entities, to participate in the public regulatory conference.
FRA believes that extensive comment from all interested parties is necessary to develop the most effective and reasonable
final regulation. For this conference to be successful, participants should come prepared to discuss, at a minimum,
the key issues identified below and to suggest reasonable alternatives to the various proposals in the NPRM. FRA also
encourages participants to bring supporting documentation where appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
(IV) Key Issues
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of issues were raised in the written comments received to date and at the public hearings. We encourage interested
parties to come prepared to respond to the following questions and to make any other comments or suggestions regarding
the issues presented. Please note that the conference is not limited to these issues. FRA does retain the authority,
however, to limit the issues discussed at the regulatory conference.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Internal Control Plans (Proposed Section 225.33)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulation proposed by FRA would require railroads to maintain written internal control plans for the preparation
of reports required under part 225. Most railroad commenters believe the internal control plan in proposed &sect;225.33
is burdensome and recommend that a performance standard of 99-percent be established to replace the internal control
plan. Dividing the number of reported accidents or incidents by the number of actual reportable accidents or incidents
would yield a number (percentage) that would then be compared against the 99-percent performance level to determine
actual performance by the railroad.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Would a performance standard system, in lieu of the proposed internal control plan, ensure FRA receives reliable
and consistent reporting data?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) How should FRA address accountability and enforceability if the carrier does not meet the 99-percent standard?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If a performance standard were adopted by FRA, penalties might be assessed based upon actual performance by the
railroad. Such a penalty would increase geometrically for each percentage point below the 99-percent performance
level, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
$1,000 penalty assessment for performance at the 98-percent level; $3,000 penalty assessment for performance at
the 97-percent level; $9,000 penalty assessment for performance at the 96-percent level, etc. Please comment on
this sliding-scale approach.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) FRA has determined that a 100-percent verification of reporting for a major railroad is not practicable given
the size of its current work force. Even 100-percent verification at a small facility might not be feasible. What is
the minimum sample size that would be required before a performance standard should be applied?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The Association of American Railroads (AAR) acknowledged and agreed that most of its members already have internal
control plans in place. Please describe these plans in detail.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) If FRA determines that a written internal control plan is in fact necessary, how would you modify the existing proposal?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Should the regulation indicate that the internal control plan be continuously updated and maintained?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Magnetic Media Submissions (Proposed Section 225.37)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule allows railroads the option of reporting data by way of magnetic media in lieu of paper forms. Please
refer to proposed &sect;225.37.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Would substitute forms be acceptable for verification when a railroad submits magnetic media?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) What would be the railroad cost differentials for developing a new computer format or modifying an existing one?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Should ``railroad-designed formats'' for the various reporting forms be allowed? How would this be accomplished?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Definitions (Proposed Section 225.5)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA proposed several new definitions in &sect;225.5. Those new definitions warranting further discussion are listed
below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. ``Worker on Duty''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA proposed that a ``worker on duty'' be defined to include individuals who receive monetary compensation from the
reporting railroad, or who are engaged in either (1) the operation of on-track equipment or (2) any other rail safety-sensitive
function for reporting railroad as described in &sect;209.303.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, a ``volunteer'' would be sort of service for the reporting railroad without receiving direct monetary
compensation from that railroad and are not engaged in either (1) the operation of on-track equipment or (2) any other
rail safety-sensitive function for the reporting railroad as described in &sect;209.303.

<TEXT>
 
<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Should ``contractors'' and ``volunteers'' in safety-sensitive positions be reported separately from ``workers
on duty''?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Should a separate classification for ``employees'' remain?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) A ``contractor'' is currently a separate classification for reporting purposes. If FRA should decide to delete
the proposed ``worker on duty'' classification, should ``volunteer'' be added as a separate classification?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) How would ``hours worked'' be calculated for contractors and volunteers involved in safety-sensitive functions?
Should these hours be listed separately?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. ``Establishment'' and ``Posted''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As proposed in the NPRM, an ``establishment'' would be defined as a single physical location where business is conducted
or where services or operations are performed, for example, an operating division, general office, and major installation,
such as a locomotive or care repair or construction facility. FRA also proposed in &sect;225.25(e) that each railroad
``post'' a listing of all reported injuries and illnesses for the previous month at each ``establishment.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) If FRA determines that the proposed ``posting'' requirement is in fact necessary, how would you redefine ``establishment''
such that any burden to the railroad is minimized?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Should each railroad be required to identify a ``recordkeeping establishment''?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Should the proposed list of definitions include one for ``posted''? Should that definition encompass ``electronic
posting,'' wherein railroad workers may view accident and injury logs via computer? Where computers are not available
at establishments, manual posting would remain a requirement. Please comment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. ``Qualified Health Care Professional'' and ``Medical Treatment''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As proposed, a ``qualified health care professional'' is defined as a health care professional operating within
the scope of his or her license, registration, or certification. For example, an otolaryngologist is qualified to
diagnose a case of noise-induced hearing loss and to identify potential causal factors, but may not be qualified to
diagnose a case of silicosis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Should the definition be narrowed so as to include only people with a medical degree, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 an M.D.? Should the definition be expanded to include additional individuals (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 physical therapists) as qualified health care professionals?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Should a railroad's employee assistance officer (EAP) be considered a ``qualified health care professional''
when he or she provides counseling to an employee who has experienced traumatic stress from involvement in a serious
or fatal accident?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As proposed, ``medical treatment'' would include any medical care or treatment beyond ``first aid'' regardless
of who provides such treatment. Medical treatment does not include diagnostic procedures, such as X-rays and drawing
blood samples.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Are there other definitions of ``medical treatment'' that could clarify reportability?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Injury/Illness Reportability
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) How are cases involving alleged noise-induced hearing loss by employees subjected to review or evaluation within
companies to determine whether FRA reportability criteria have been met?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Does the railroad's reporting officer determine reportability of noise-induced hearing loss or is this determination
made by another employee (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, industrial hygienist, supervisor)? If the ``reportability'' decision is made by someone other than the reporting
officer, how is this decision conveyed to the reporting officer?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Should the proposed internal control plan indicate how the review of an alleged noise-induced hearing loss case
is accomplished?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. ``Recordable'' Injury/Illness
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA proposed to define ``recordable'' injury or illness as intending to encompass any condition, not otherwise reportable,
of a railroad worker that is associated with an event, exposure, or activity in the work environment that causes or
requires the worker to be examined or treated by a qualified health care professional. Such treatment would usually
occur at a location other than the work environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Does this proposed definition of ``recordable'' result in greater risk of a railroad supervisor exerting pressure
on an injured or ill employee to avoid seeing a physician so that the injury or illness is not reported to FRA?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. ``Recordable'' Rail Equipment Accident/Incident
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Likewise, a ``recordable'' rail equipment accident/incident would encompass any event not otherwise reportable
involving the operation of on-track equipment that causes physical damage to either the on-track equipment or the
track upon which such equipment was operated and that requires the removal or repair of rail equipment before any rail
operations over the track can continue. A ``recordable'' rail equipment accident/incident, if not tended to, would
thus disrupt railroad service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) FRA does not wish to place an undue reporting burden on railroads by requiring them to maintain a log of ``fender
bender'' accidents. What term or threshold could be used to capture these accidents in a listing or log?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) What elements or fields should be kept in the log that would provide FRA inspectors with enough information to audit
these nonreportable accidents without placing an undue burden on the railroads?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Is there a method of recording these accidents (below the reporting threshold) by means other than a standard form?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Please comment on the following alternate definition for a ``recordable'' rail equipment accident: a ``recordable''
rail equipment accident/incident is any event not otherwise reportable, involving the operation of on-track equipment
that causes physical damage to either the on-track equipment or to the track, roadbed, signals and/or structures
provided such equipment could be safely operated to its full range of function without repairs. (Note: Incidents
arising from broken knuckles, failed journals, and dragging equipment that does not cause damage beyond that of the
item of equipment that failed, are not required to be ``logged'' on Form FRA F 6180.xx).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
G. Calculation of Damage Costs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA proposed that material/equipment costs could be calculated based upon the costs of acquired new material, even
if the railroad chooses to use used or refurbished materials in its actual repairs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) What method(s) could be employed to accurately reflect the cost of accidents that would provide a comparable method
of comparison when using refurbished equipment?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) What alternative method could be employed that would accurately reflect the severity of accidents such that when
two identical derailments occur, they are reflected or rated identically even though their actual repair cost using
refurbished material are very different?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
H. Seven-Day Notification (Proposed Section 225.39(a))
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA proposed that each railroad worker must notify his or her employer, in writing, of any reportable or recordable
injury or illness within seven calendar days of incurring or obtaining knowledge of such injury or illness.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Should railroads require more immediate notice?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Should the railroad worker be assessed a monetary penalty for failure to report an accident or injury to his or her
employer?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) Should the railroad worker's supervisor be assessed a monetary penalty for failure to report a known accident
or injury that occurred to a railroad worker?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) With respect to ``notifying his or her employer in writing,'' would the seven-day provision require employees
to complete the company's standard ``personal injury/illness statement'' for any alleged noise-induced hearing
loss case?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Should proposed &sect;225.39(a) contain language that would exclude the employee's ``seven-day notification
in writing requirement'' in the event of severe injury and fatality cases when it may not be possible for the employee
to comply with this provision?

I. Notification to Worker (Proposed Section 225.39(b))
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA proposed that each railroad shall provide a copy of the proposed Railroad Worker Injury and Illness Log (Form FRA
F 6180.xx) to the injured or ill worker within seven calendar days of completing the log.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) What steps should be taken to notify the employee that his or her case has been reported to FRA? Could this be accomplished
without placing an excessive burden on the reporting railroad?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Should proposed &sect;225.39(b) contain language that would exclude the railroad from providing a copy of the
proposed Railroad Worker Injury and Illness Log to the injured or ill worker within seven calendar days of completing
the log when this may not be possible in severe injury and fatality cases?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

J. Recordkeeping (Proposed Section 225.25)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Logs for Recording Injuries (Proposed Section 225.25(a))
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA proposed that each railroad shall maintain the Railroad Worker Injury and Illness Log (Form FRA F 6180.xx) of all
reportable and recordable injuries and illnesses to railroad workers for each railroad establishment, including,
but not limited to, an operating division, general office, and major installation such as a locomotive or car repair
or construction facility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) What technique do railroads currently utilize to record injuries, even those not reportable to the FRA?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Should FRA require railroads to maintain the employee's handwritten personal injury/illness statement on file?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Logs for Recording Accidents (Proposed Section 225.25(b))
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA proposed that each railroad shall maintain the Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Log (Form FRA F 6180.xx(a))
and Property Damage Estimate Worksheet and Record (Form FRA F 6180.xx(b)) of reportable and recordable collisions,
derailments, fires, explosions, acts of God, or other events involving the operation of railroad on-track equipment,
signals, track, or track equipment (standing or moving) that result in damages to railroad on-track equipment, signals,
tracks, track structures, or roadbed, including labor costs and all other costs for repairs or replacement in kind
for each railroad establishment.

1. Ethnic and Gender Codes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA proposed requiring the gender and ethnicity of the injured or ill person on Form FRA F 6180.55a (Railroad Injury
and Illness (Continuation Sheet)), in an effort to help identify whether particular groups of individuals are more
susceptible than others to certain injuries and illnesses, particularly as trespassers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Are these elements (gender and ethnicity) necessary or desirable? Could an alternative be found that would serve
the same purpose, such as ``ability to read or comprehend instructions, signs, or warnings in English'' or ``ability
to interpret non-verbal instructions, signs, or warnings''?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

3. Special Study Blocks (SSB)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA proposes to establish three SSB's on Form FRA F 6180.54 (Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Report) for the purpose
of temporarily collecting information on these issues of immediate safety concern. When one or more critical safety
issues arise, FRA would notify the railroad reporting officers and request that they, for a specified time-frame,
collect and report on the critical issues using the SSB. Upon expiration of the pre-defined time period, the SSB would
not be used again until the next issues of immediate concern.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Are the SSB's necessary or desirable?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) What limitations should be placed on the SSB usage?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Should FRA add a similar special study block (SSB) to Form FRA F 6180.57 to capture data on unusual or special situations?

In order to collect more information on motorists involved in highway-rail grade crossing accidents, FRA proposed
to amend Form FRA F 6180.57 (Highway-Rail Grade Crossing Accident/Incident Report) to require information under
the heading ``Motorist,'' if known, on the motorist's age and gender, and whether the motorist was impaired by alcohol
or drugs at the time of the accident/incident.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) How many times has a railroad been denied access to a police report? Please cite specific instances.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA proposes to add two new questions to the Highway-Rail Grade Crossing Accident/Incident Report (Form FRA F 6180.57)
to gather information on whistle bans and signal system failures. New block ``34'' asks whether a whistle ban was in
effect and observed at the time of the accident/incident. New block ``35'' asks whether there was a signal system failure
within the last seven calendar days up to and including the day of the accident. The codes for completing both items
would be included in the FRA Guide.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Ford Motor Company (Ford) and the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association (RVIA) have each submitted petitions
asking NHTSA to clarify some provisions in the roof crush resistance standard. Specifically, both these petitioners
suggested changes to the current specifications for placing the load plate on vehicles during compliance testing,
particularly vehicles with sloped aerodynamic roofs or raised roofs. NHTSA has granted both of these petitions.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Standard No. 216 (49 CFR 571.216) sets forth roof crush resistance requirements that must be met by passenger cars,
trucks, buses, and multipurpose passenger vehicles with a GVWR of 6000 pounds or less. The purpose of the standard,
as stated in S2 of the standard, is ``to reduce deaths and injuries due to the crushing of the roof into the passenger
compartment in rollover accidents.''

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Standard No. 216 seeks to achieve this purpose by requiring vehicles to be certified as complying with a performance
test in which a load of 11/2 times the unloaded vehicle weight (up to a maximum of 5000 pounds for passenger cars) is applied
to the vehicle roof by means of a rigid unyielding block whose lower surface consists of a flat rectangle 30 inches wide
and 72 inches long. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the test, the plate is required to be positioned so that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) When viewed from the side of the test vehicle, the test plate is angled 5
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; toward the front of the vehicle;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When viewed from the front of the test vehicle, the test plate is angled 25
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; below the horizontal on the side of the vehicle to which the test plate is applied; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The initial contact point of the test plate with the test vehicle roof is 10 inches from the forwardmost point of
the test plate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The test plate orientation and placement are illustrated in Figure 1 of Standard No. 216. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These requirements were initially proposed in a notice published on January 6, 1971 (36 FR 3) and are patterned after
the specifications in the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Standard J374. At that time, most vehicle roofs were
less rounded than today's designs, and there were no raised-roof vehicles to be tested. Thus, the specifications
for positioning the test plate ensured that it would be positioned to measure the roof's strength in the A-pillar region
and to ensure that the strength was sufficient to prevent sudden collapse of the roof above the A-pillars and front
seating areas during rollovers.

A. RVIA
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
RVIA recently submitted a petition asking that vans, motor homes and other multipurpose passenger vehicles, trucks,
and buses that have raised roofs and that are now subject to Standard No. 216 be tested according to the requirements
of Standard No. 220, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
School Bus Rollover Protection. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Standard No. 220 subjects vehicles to the same force on the roof as does Standard No. 216 (11/2 times the unloaded vehicle
weight), but the force is applied differently. The test plate used in Standard No. 220 is larger than the 30&times;72
inch plate used in Standard No. 216. In addition, instead of concentrating the load in the vicinity of the A-pillars
the test load is evenly distributed over the entire roof in Standard No. 220.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RVIA used the following arguments to support its petition:

(1) There are several van conversions currently produced with raised roofs that are subject to Standard No. 216. Such
vehicles include conversions of the Plymouth Voyager, Doge Caravan, Chrysler Town &amp; Country, Chevrolet Astro,
and GMC Safari minivans. Because of the raised roof configuration, the load plate for the test cannot be placed according
to the specified procedure in the standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Since the original vehicles, prior to conversion that raises the roof, have been certified as complying with Standard
No. 216, the A-pillar strength will have already been demonstrated. Testing to Standard No. 220 after raising the
roof would then test the strength of the entire roof structure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Ford
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ford recently submitted a petition focused on what it believes is an anomaly with the current positioning procedures
for the test plate in Standard No. 216. Ford indicated that several of its models with aerodynamic roof designs have
roof slopes greater than 5
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; at the forward edge of the roof. The test plate is required to be angled 5
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; of the forward edge of the roof. The effect of the slope on these aerodynamic roof designs is that the initial point
of contact between the roof and the test plate is moved several inches behind the A-pillar when the test plate is positioned
according to the current placement procedure. Ford believes this rearward movement of the initial contact point
is contrary to the agency's intent when it initially promulgated the standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ford argued that additional support for this argument can be found in S6.2 of Standard No. 216, which specifies the
test plate should be applied by ``(o)rient(ing) the test device as shown in Figure 1 *&blank;*&blank;*'' Figure 1
clearly shows the test plate is applied at the front corner of the roof. Thus, for vehicles with sloped, aerodynamic
roofs, there is a conflict between Figure 1, which positions the test plate forward of the leading edge of the roof,
and S6.2(d), which specifies that the test plate should be positioned with reference to the initial point of contact,
even if that point is rearward of the leading edge of the roof. Ford acknowledged that NHTSA has addressed this conflict
in an October 3, 1980 interpretation, in which the agency said that the language of S6.2(d) should be used to position
the test plate, even if that means the test plate will not be forward of the A-pillar or the roof's leading edge. Ford
indicated that it has followed this interpretation, but it does not believe that such an interpretation results in
improved roof crush performance when vehicles are in use on the public roads.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ford asked in its petition that S6.2(d) of Standard No. 216 be amended to specify that the leading edge of the test plate
should always be placed over the leading edge of the vehicle roof. Ford proposed the following language:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The initial contact point, or center of the initial contact area, is on the longitudinal centerline of the device.
A plane perpendicular to the lower surface of the test device and 25 mm rearward of the front edge of the lower surface
passes through the rearmost point of the opening in the body structure for the windshield.

Agency Response to the Petitions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA believes that both of these petitions raise issues that should be examined further. RVIA believes the requirement
to move the test plate rearward of the A-pillar on conversion vans with raised roofs imposes needless and significant
burdens on second-stage manufacturers. Ford believes the requirement to move the test plate rearward of the A-pillar
on vehicles with aerodynamic roofs is contrary to the agency's original intent and results in a less stringent test
of the A-pillars' strength. both of these are relevant issues. Accordingly, the agency has granted both the RVIA and
Ford petitions. NHTSA is now conducting a research program to investigate the test methods described in these petitions
and to see if the current test procedures are suitable for vehicles with raised or contour roofs, or if some changed
test procedures are needed.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fact that the agency has granted these petitions does not mean that the requirements of the standard will necessarily
be modified. NHTSA has undertaken to investigate this issue more carefully and, after the conclusion of this investigation,
will decide whether it should propose any modifications to the test procedure. In the meantime, manufacturers must
continue to certify their vehicles for compliance according to the existing requirements of Standard No. 216 unless
and until some modified requirements are in place.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the fact that the agency has granted these petitions does not mean that NHTSA agrees with all that is said in
these petitions. For instance, the RVIA petition asks that Standard No. 220 test for roof crush resistance be substituted
for the current Standard No. 216 test for roof crush resistance. NHTSA is concerned that such a substitution could
result in a less stringent test over the front seating positions, or may not be appropriate to evaluate the strength
of the pillars for crush resistance. Standard No. 220 was developed for school buses and it assesses the roof crush
protection afforded for the entire seating area. It does this by using a test procedure that loads the entire roof structure,
including A-, B-, and any other pillars in the vehicle.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By way of contrast, Standard No. 216 is applicable to smaller vehicles. Front seat occupants experience the vast majority
of deaths and injuries in these vehicles. To address this, a test procedure was developed to assess the roof crush protection
afforded to front seat occupants. The test procedure concentrates the load in the vicinity of one of the A-pillars
to simulate the most severe impact condition that a pillar would experience in a rollover crash.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It appears, then, that substituting the Standard No. 220 test for raised roof vehicles instead of the Standard No.
216 test, would trade off increased roof crush protection for rear seat occupants in those vehicles, with diminished
protection for front seat occupants. However, there is no supporting information in the RIVA petition that quantifies
either how much protection front seat occupants might lose or how much protection rear seat occupants might gain from
this substitution. The agency will examine this carefully in its research before deciding whether to consider any
change to the current test requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, RVIA suggested that the strength of the A-pillars in the vehicle that is converted by its members would
be demonstrated by the original vehicle manufacturer's certification for the vehicle that complied with Standard
No. 216. The agency is not convinced at this point that this conclusion is valid because the agency has no data to prove
or disprove that the roof strength in the area of the A-pillars is affected by raised roof conversions. RVIA provided
no such data in its petition in support of their claim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its petition, Ford did provide some test data, although they were very limited. Ford provided roof crush test results
for two prototypes of a new vehicle design. In one, the test plate was positioned according to the current Standard
No. 216 procedures. In the second, the front edge of the test plate was positioned 100 mm behind the front corner of the
roof (closer to the A-pillar structure). The test results from the latter procedure produced a peak force that was
49 percent higher than the peak force produced using the current positioning procedure, within 5 inches of crush.
When following Standard No. 216 test procedures, the test plate was positioned 150 mm behind the windshield opening,
completely missing the A-pillar and leading edge of the roof.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ford's petition indicates that its proposed change to the language of S6.2(d) would consistently locate the test
place one inch forward of the rearmost edge of the front windshield opening, thereby reducing test variability and
ensuring that the test plate is positioned ahead of the roof's leading edge. NHTSA notes that while this would position
the test plate over the leading edge of the roof, it would not necessarily load the roof at the rearmost windshield opening.
Ford's proposed change retained the same test plate angles currently specified in Standard No. 216, which means the
initial contact point for the test plate on the roof would be the same as at present. In other words, it appears to NHTSA
that Ford's proposal would ensure the consistent orientation of the test plate over the front of the roof, but would
not ensure that area of the roof would be tested. Further, the agency is uncertain whether the proposed test plate positioning
one inch forward of the rearmost edge of the front windshield opening would be an improved test for all vehicles with
uncommon roof shapes or whether it would reduce the stringency of the current test procedure.

Areas in Which the Public's Ideas and Information Are Requested
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency is interested in comments on the changes requested in both the Ford and RVIA petitions. Therefore, the agency
is seeking from all interested parties comments on the two proposals along with any available test data to substantiate
or refute those proposals. The agency is also interested in other ways to accommodate aerodynamically sloped and
raised roof vehicles. For instance, should the angles at which the test plate is applied and/or the size and shape of
the test plate itself be changed? If the plate size were reduced or if the plate shape were changed to circular, the test
plate could be placed over the A-pillar region on raised roof vehicles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standard No. 216 currently provides that the test plate shall be angled 5
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; toward the front of the vehicle, when viewed from the side of the test vehicle. This angle could be changed sufficiently
to ensure the test plate would contact the A-pillar region, with the new angle based on an analysis of real world crashes
and roof geometries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is also interested in any other approaches the public might wish to suggest in this area. As always, the most
helpful comments will be those that set forth data to substantiate the position taken in the comment. NHTSA would like
to alert commenters that the agency will not propose any changes to Standard No. 216 test procedures until the agency
is satisfied that data and analysis show the changes will not reduce real world safety protection for vehicle occupants.

Section4(b)(3)(B) of the Endangered Species Act (Act) of 1973 as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

), requires that, for any petition to revise the List of Threatened and Endangered Species that contains substantial
scientific or commercial information indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted, a finding must be made
within 12 months of the date of receipt of the petition on whether the petitioned action is (i) not warranted, (ii) warranted,
or (iii) warranted but precluded by the efforts to revise the list and expeditious progress is being made in listing
and delisting species. Upon making the finding, a notice shall be promptly published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. With this notice, the Service announces its 12-month finding on the petition to list the Canada lynx is not warranted.
This finding is based on various documents, including published and unpublished studies, agency files, field survey
records, and consultations with other Federal and State agencies. This notice summarizes information contained
in the 12-month finding and represents the conclusion of the Service's status review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In August 1991, the U.S. Fish And Wildlife Service (Service) received a petition from several conservation organizations
requesting that the Service list the lynx of the North Cascades ecosystem as an endangered species and designate critical
habitat.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 6, 1992, the Service published a notice of a petition finding indicating that there was not substantial
information to indicate that listing the North Cascades population of the Canada lynx as endangered may be warranted
(57 FR 46007). On July 9, 1993, the Service published a notice of a second finding on the North Cascades petition after
evaluating new information and again found that there was not substantial information to indicate that listing the
population may be warranted (58 FR 36924). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following publication of the notice, the petitioners filed suit challenging the finding. A settlement agreement
was reached on November 30, 1993, where the Service agreed to conduct a full status review of the lynx throughout its
range in the lower 48 States and to determine whether it qualified as endangered or threatened pursuant to 16 U.S.C.
Part 1533(a). On February 2, 1994, the Service published a notice (59 FR 4887) announcing continuation of a status
review initiated in 1982. The Service reviewed and considered public comments during its evaluation of the status
of the lynx in the contiguous U.S.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A petition dated April 23, 1994, was received by the Service from the Biodiversity Legal Foundation on April 27, 1994.
The petition requested that the conterminous U.S. population of the North American lynx (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Felis lynx canadensis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) be listed as a threatened or endangered species. The petition provided numerous reasons for why the Canada lynx population
in the contiguous U.S. should be added to the List of Threatened and Endangered Species. The petitioners also requested
that the southern Rocky Mountain population of the lynx be protected by emergency listing because it is severely imperiled,
the population level is low, and it is reproductively isolated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice of a 90-day finding published in the August 26, 1994, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 44123) found that there was substantial information to indicate that listing the contiguous population of
the Canada lynx may be warranted. However, the notice also indicated that the petition did not present substantial
information to indicate the emergency listing of the Canada lynx in the southern Rockies is warranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The lynx, generally considered rare because of its secretive nature, is actually common throughout its Northern
American range. Lynx occupy the boreal regions of North America, commonly referred to as the Canadian and Hudsonian
Life Zones. These habitats are characterized by dense coniferous forests and wet bogs. Cold climates, deep snow,
and wildfire are major influences on these habitats. Lynx are found within these habitats from Newfoundland, Labrador,
and Quebec on the east to Alaska and British Columbia on the west; from the Arctic treeline south into portions of the
contiguous U.S. (Brittell et al. 1989). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specific to the U.S., lynx distribution represents the fringe of the population occurring in its historic range.
Consequently, the lynx does not commonly occur within this southern limit of its range due to the lack of favorable
habitats. Favorable habitat conditions for the lynx dissipate with decreasing latitude. Thus, the lynx is restricted
to higher elevations the more southern the latitude. The most southern range extensions for the species are found
in the Rocky Mountains and associated high elevations. The distribution and population numbers of the lynx closely
follow that of the snowshoe hare, its primary food item. During population highs, snowshoe hare may occupy marginal
habitats thereby, allowing the lynx to widen their distribution (Brittell et al. 1989). During years of abundance,
lynx may extend their distribution and occur in higher densities along the southern extension of their range. This
fluctuation of population size and distribution is attributed to dispersal of predominately young animals from
the resident Canadian population. Local ``irruptions'' or invasions of lynx have been reported in the northern U.S.
following population highs further north in Canada. Population cycles may not be as noticeable in the southern extremes
of the lynx range because such habitat is not an important part of its range and U.S. resident populations are initially
low.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The historic range of the lynx in the contiguous U.S. has generally been recognized as including New England (Maine,
New Hampshire, Vermont and New York), the Great Lakes (Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota), the Rocky Mountains (Idaho,
Montana, Wyoming, Utah, and Colorado) and the Northwest Region (Washington and Oregon). There is evidence that presence
of lynx in the contiguous U.S. corresponded to cyclic dispersals from Canada (particularly in the Great Lakes region).
Thus, the Service believes that some of these States within the species' historic range never supported viable resident
populations of lynx over time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Northeastern and Great Lakes forests are sub-boreal forests and therefore fire regimes, important for the creation
of snowshoe hare habitat, do not function as in true boreal forests. Most of these original sub-boreal forests were
destroyed by lumbering and agricultural activities by the late 1880's and early 1900's. The lynx was already extirpated
from the New England States (except for Maine) by the turn of the century.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lynx were extremely scarce in the first half of the century in Montana. By 1979, the population was estimated to be between
1800 and 2500 animals. Lumbering activities and wildfire of the early 1920's, has affected Montana's present population
of lynx which is the largest in the contiguous U.S. Montana also has the largest amount of available habitat (Giddings
1994). In the Cascades (Northwest Region), lynx benefit from relative isolation of large undisturbed tracts of habitat
(approximately 3,673 square miles) and in the State of Washington, there is about 6,500 square miles of lynx habitat
(Brittell et al. 1989).

The Canada lynx (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) is one and the same species (a monotypic species) throughout its entire range in North America. The term ``species''
under the Act includes any subspecies of fish, wildlife, and plants, and any distinct population segment of any species
of vertebrate fish and wildlife which interbreeds when mature. The Service limited it status review of the lynx to
the 48 contiguous States, as directed in the settlement agreement and requested in the petition.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Canada lynx is widely distributed throughout the northern boreal forests of Canada and Alaska. Its extreme southern
limits are the U.S./Canada border areas with the southern-most extensions found in the Rocky Mountains. Historically,
lynx populations were minimal in the contiguous U.S. due to a lack of suitable habitat. During years of lynx abundance
in Canada increased densities of resident populations resulted along the southern boundary of its range. There is
evidence that the increased presence of lynx in the contiguous U.S. corresponds to cyclic dispersals from Canada.
At the turn of the century and especially in the Northeastern portion of the U.S., habitat loss due to human settlement
and forest clearing reduced the southern range of the lynx. Since the 1970's, this trend has reversed in some States.
Presently, Maine, Montana and Washington have resident lynx populations. In Montana prior to 1950, lynx were considered
to be extremely rare. Today, however, an estimated 700 to 1,050 lynx could occupy approximately 37,000 square miles
of montane forest habitat in Montana (Giddings 1994).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the contiguous U.S., lynx inhabit fairly remote, isolated areas. Before 1977, pelt prices were low, approximately
$12.00 a piece and lynx were harvested incidental to other furbearers. In 1977, all felids, including lynx, were listed
in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Appendix
II species may be internationally traded provided CITES export permits are issued. The issuance of permits provides
a means of monitoring trade and determining if it is having a significant impact on the species. In conjunction with
CITES, States are required to have a management program and a harvest season for the species. Presently only five States
have a trapping season for lynx_Alaska, Idaho, Minnesota, Montana, and Washington. In 1984, Minnesota closed its
lynx season and Washington followed suit in 1990. Presently only Idaho and Montana of the lower 48 States allow a limited
annual harvest of two and three animals, respectively. These quotas include the incidental take of lynx by bobcat
trappers. From 1982 to 1992, only three lynx were trapped in Idaho. From 1993 to 1994, only four animals were taken in
Montana. These low harvest levels are contributed to the low level of hunting and trapping occurring in the remote
areas inhabited by lynx. Hunting and trapping pressure on the lynx has been historically low in the U.S. and there is
little evidence that these activities pose a threat to the continued existence of this species in the wild.

C. Disease or Predation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Canada lynx could be displaced or eliminated by expansion of competitors such as the bobcat (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lynx rufus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) or coyote (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Canis latrans
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) into their present range. However, lynx are more restricted to areas that receive deep snow cover where they are more
highly adapted than are bobcats. Neither disease nor predation is known to be a threat to the lynx.

D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanism
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The lynx is protected in each State where it occurs in the lower 48 contiguous States. Seven States classify it as threatened
or endangered or a species of concern. Idaho and Montana have a trapping season with annual Statewide harvest quotas
of two and three animals, respectively. Hunting and trapping with dogs and taking with firearms is illegal in every
State except one in which the lynx occurs. Few if any States ever had a bounty system for the species. In addition to State
protection, the lynx has been listed in Appendix II of CITES since 1977, and its status and harvest levels have been
monitored by the Service's Office of Scientific Authority.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting its Continued Existence
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Lynx distribution has not significantly changed from historic ranges except for periodic peripheral shifts of distribution
with cyclical changes of its chief prey, the snowshoe or varying hare (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lepus americanus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and local losses due to loss of habitat in southern-most areas. Fire suppression in the contiguous 48 States has
had some effect on lynx numbers, since early successional habitats are important to lynx due to a greater abundance
of snowshoe hares in these areas. Although early regeneration stages of habitat are preferred by hares, lynx hunt
primarily in more open mature and later successional stages of forest.

Finding
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act requires the Service to make determinations regarding listings solely on the basis of the best available scientific
and commercial data after conducting a review of the status of the species and after taking into account those efforts
being made by State and Federal agencies to protect the species. The Act also allows for the Service to list ``distinct
population segments'' of vertebrate fish and wildlife.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service was petitioned to list the Canada lynx in the 40 contiguous States as a vertebrate population pursuant
to the Endangered Species Act. The Service conducted a status review of the Canada lynx in the contiguous U.S. After
carefully evaluating the best available scientific and commercial information regarding the past, present and
future threats faced by this species, the Service finds that listing of the Canada lynx in the contiguous U.S. is not
warranted. The Service also finds that the petition did not present substantial information that the southern Rocky
Mountain population of the Canada lynx meets the definition of a ``species'' under section 3(15) of the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Canada lynx is naturally low density-occurring carnivore throughout the northern boreal forests of Canada and
Alaska with its extreme southern limits occurring south of the U.S./Canada border. It was never a common species in
the contiguous U.S. because of limited suitable habitat and, except for in Maine, Montana and Washington, little
evidence of breeding populations south of the border exists. Presence of the species in most of the contiguous 48 States
corresponds to cyclic dispersals from Canada.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the turn of the century, habitat loss due to human settlement and forest clearing reduced the range of lynx in southern
areas. However, the lynx currently occupies much of its original historic range. The Service is unable to substantiate
that trapping, hunting, poaching, and present habitat destruction threaten the continued existence of the lynx
in the wild in the contiguous U.S. Consequently, the Service finds that listing the Canada lynx in the contiguous U.S.
is not warranted. The Service's 12-month finding contains more detailed information regarding the above decisions.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On March 30, 1993, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) published a final rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
determining the coastal California gnatcatcher to be a threatened species (58 FR 16741). In its decision to the list
the gnatcatcher, the Service relied, in part, on taxonomic studies conducted by Dr. Jonathan Atwood of the Manomet
Bird Observatory, Manomet, Massachusetts. As is the standard practice in the scientific community, the Service
did not request, nor was it offered, the data collected and used by Dr. Atwood in reaching his conclusions. Instead,
the Service depended upon the conclusions published by Dr. Atwood in a peer-reviewed scientific article on the subspecific
taxonomy of the California gnatcatcher (Atwood 1991).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to a suit filed by the Endangered Species Committee of the Building Industry Association of Southern California
and other plaintiffs, the United States District Court of the District of Columbia vacated the listing of the coastal
California gnatcatcher because the Service did not make available Atwood's data for public review and comment. In
response to the court decision, Dr. Atwood released his data to the Service, which the agency made available to the
public for review and comment on June 2, 1994 (59 FR 28508). On June 16, 1994, the court reinstated threatened status
for the coastal California gnatcatcher until the Secretary of the Interior determines in a finding whether the listing
should be revised or revoked in light of his review of the subject data and public comments received during the comment
period. As a result of the court orders of July 27, 1994, and September 30, 1994, the Service extended the comment period
to December 1, 1994, (59 FR 38426, 59 FR 44125, and 59 FR 53628).

The Service received 11 substantive comments in response to the request for public comments on Dr. Atwood's data and
analysis. Of particular note, Dr. William Link mathematician, and Grey Pendleton, biometrician, with the National
Biological Survey (NBS) conducted new analyses of these data and presented it in a report (Link and Pendleton 1994).
Their four conclusions were:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) That the morphological characters in Atwood's data set vary along the geographical gradient, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) That the changes in characters are more reasonably represented by discrete groupings than by a gradual pattern
of change, and are thus consistent with the existence of subgroups within the population, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) That there is at least 1 break north of site 5 (Atwood's BG27) [approximately 30
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; N latitude], and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) That there is at least 1 break south of site 5.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, the Service received two additional statistical analyses (Dr. Atwood; and Dr. Karen Messer, Department
of Mathematics, California State University, Fullerton) that supported a southern terminus of 30
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; N latitude for the coastal California gnatcatcher. However, the Service received three significant comments
that, for various reasons, did not support such a southern terminus (Dr. George Barrowclough, ornithologist from
New York; Dr. Lyman McDonald, consultant from Wyoming; and Dr. James MacMahon and other colleagues, College of Science,
Utah State University).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the NBS report (Link and Pendleton 1994), the Service reopens the comment period to ensure that the public
may review and comment on this and other significant comments and analyses received during the original public comment
period. The comment period is opened through January 26, 1995.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) regulates international
trade in certain animal and plant species. As a general rule, exports of animals and plants listed on Appendix II of
CITES may occur only if a Scientific Authority has advised a permit-issuing Management Authority that such exports
will not be detrimental to the survival of the species and if the Management Authority is satisfied that the animals
or plants were not obtained in violation of laws for their protection. Based on documentation presented for consideration
by the CITES Parties in 1983, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) has determined that the American alligator
is listed on Appendix II for reasons of similarity in appearance under Article II.2(b) of CITES as well as the potential
threat to the species survival under CITES Article II.2(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

This notice announces proposed findings by the U.S. Scientific Authority and Management Authority on the export
of alligators harvested during the 1995&hyph;1997 taking seasons from certain States previously approved for such
export for the 1992&hyph;1994 harvest seasons and for the State of Arkansas which was previously approved for the
1994 harvest season. These proposed findings also stipulate that monitoring procedures previously established
for this species be continued.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, references in the regulation concerning the manner in which tags are to be attached to American alligator
hides at the time of export and the conditions for export of parts and products are being clarified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service requests comments on these proposed findings and information on the species involved.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Since 1977, the Service has employed the rulemaking process to develop and issue decisions on the export of certain
species under CITES. The reason for this approach is that it is more effective to issue general decisions on the export
of all specimens of a species harvested in a given State and season than to issue such decisions separately for each
permit application. This is especially true for CITES Appendix II species that are frequently exported, such as the
American alligator. On May 26, 1992 (57 FR 21896), the Service published rules granting export approval for American
alligators (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Alligator mississippiensis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) from specified States for the 1992&hyph;1994 harvest seasons. Subsequently, based on advice from the Office of
Scientific Authority and the Office of Management Authority, the Service also approved the export of farm-raised
American alligators from the State of Arkansas for the 1994 harvest season. The purpose of this current proposal is
to develop a rule that will allow the export of legally taken American alligators (hides, meat, parts, and products)
for the 1995&hyph;1997 harvest years from previously approved States.

Scientific Authority Findings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Article II, paragraph 2, of CITES establishes that Appendix II shall include:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) All species which although not necessarily now threatened with extinction may become so unless trade in specimens
of such species is subject to strict regulations in order to avoid utilization incompatible with their survival;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) Other species which must be subject to regulation in order that trade in specimens of certain species referred
to in sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph may be brought under effective control.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The American alligator is listed in Appendix II to respond both to problems of potential threat to the survival of the
species [CITES Article II.2(a)] and of the similarity of appearance to other crocodilians that are threatened with
possible extinction [CITES Article II.2(b)]. Article IV of CITES requires that an export permit for any specimen
of a species included in Appendix II shall only be granted when certain findings have been made by the Scientific Authority
and Management Authority of the exporting country. The marking of hides with specified tags, the marking and documentation
of shipments of meat and parts, and the issuance of export permits specifically for American alligator parts and products
is considered sufficient to address the issue of identification due to similarity in appearance between American
alligators and other listed crocodilian species. Because the alligator is listed partly due to the potential threat
to its survival based on previous population declines that have been reversed in most parts of its range in the United
States, the Service must determine that allowing exports and thereby stimulating harvest will not be detrimental
to the survival of the species itself. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The U.S. Scientific Authority must develop advice on nondetriment for the export of Appendix II species in accordance
with Section 8A of the Endangered Species Act (Act) of 1973, as amended. The Act states that the Secretary of the Interior,
``shall base such determinations and advice given by him under Article IV of the CITES with respect to wildlife upon
the best available biological information derived from professionally accepted wildlife management practices;
but is not required to make, or require any State to make, estimates of population size in making such determinations
or giving such advice.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Guidelines developed for Scientific Authority advice on exports of American alligator under provisions of CITES
Article II.2(a), are summarized as follows:

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Minimum Requirements for a Management Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) There should be a controlled harvest with the methods and seasons determined by the State; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) All hides, meat, and parts should be registered and marked; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Harvest level objectives should be determined annually by the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In applying these guidelines, the Service considers the following types of information on the conditions of the population:
(a) A current estimate [if such information is available] of the total number of animals in the pre-harvest population
derived by appropriate scientific censusing methodology; (b) a description of ongoing research being conducted
to assess the distribution, abundance, or general condition of the species in the State with a summarization of results
obtained, including results of any analysis of age structure or reproductive parameters; and (c) an assessment of
long-term population trends of the species in the State and the relationship of these trends to habitat conditions,
management practices, harvest pressure, and/or other factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information on anticipated harvest to be considered by the Service includes: (a) The number of animals to be harvested
[by county or game management unit, if data are available at these local levels]; (b) the number of alligator hunters
expected to be licensed; and (c) the time of the harvest season. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of the alligator, as with most other wild animals, the resource is monitored by a variety of techniques that
yield information used in evaluating the condition of a population. As these data are accumulated over time, they
reflect trends and call attention to changes in the populations. Habitat information, indices of population size,
age and sex structure, and harvest information are all used to evaluate population status. Although the Endangered
Species Act Amendments of 1982 provided that population estimates are not to be required for the approval of export
of Appendix II wildlife, if such estimates are provided by the States or are otherwise available, they will be considered
together with information of the types listed above in making findings on nondetriment.

In addition to considering the effect of trade on species or populations native to the United States that are being
exported, the Scientific Authority will also monitor the status of the American alligator to: (a) Determine whether
treatment of the American alligator remains appropriate; and (b) detect any significant downward trends in the populations
and, where necessary, advise on more restrictive export controls in response to these trends. This monitoring and
assessment will follow the same procedures adopted for other CITES-listed species (see 49 FR 590, January 5, 1984).
The Service will review information on population status and harvest data relevant to the no detriment finding process
from each export-approved State, as appropriate. When indicated by available information and a thorough review
of accumulated data, a determination can then be made about the treatment of this species and whether the management
program needs to be adjusted in a particular State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The status of the American alligator has dramatically improved throughout its range since the species was placed
under State and Federal control. One of the primary reasons for this improvement has been the effective management
programs administered by State wildlife agencies. The Service expects these management programs to continue to
be effective in conserving the American alligator in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The export of American alligators taken in the 1992 through 1994 harvest seasons in certain States was previously
approved by the Service (57 FR 21896). In that rule, the Service found that current information on the population status,
management, and harvest available from the States included in the rule, along with other information collected by
the Service, supported a finding that the export of American alligators taken in accordance with State regulations
in those States and in those harvest seasons would not be detrimental to the survival of the species in those States
approved for export. The Service's previous assessment of the status of the alligator under the Endangered Species
Act was sufficient to support reclassification of the species throughout its range from threatened to threatened
for similarity of appearance. This reclassification was accomplished in different parts of its range as the biological
status of the alligator improved. The following rulemaking documents provide the rationale for the removal of threatened
and endangered listings: 40 FR 44412, September 26, 1975; 42 FR 2071, January 10, 1977; 44 FR 37130, June 25, 1979; 46
FR 40664, August 10, 1981; 48 FR 46332, October 12, 1983; 50 FR 25672, June 20, 1985; and 51 FR 19760, June 2, 1986.

Based upon information available from the previously approved States and in consideration of the tagging requirements
stipulated by the Management Authority, the Service proposes to issue Scientific Authority advice in favor of export
of alligator hides and parts legally harvested in those States during the 1995&hyph;97 harvest seasons.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Exports of Appendix II species are to be allowed under CITES only if the Scientific Authority advises that the exports
will not be detrimental to the survival of the species and if the Management Authority is satisfied that the specimens
were not obtained in contravention of laws enacted for their protection. The Service, therefore, must be satisfied
that the American alligator hides, meat, or products being exported were not obtained in violation of State or Federal
laws for their protection. For the American alligator, evidence of legal take is provided by Service-approved State
export tagging and container marking programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist these State export tagging programs, the Service annually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contracts for the manufacture and delivery of special CITES animal-hide tags for Service-approved, export-qualified
States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice, published on April 24, 1986 (51 FR 15548), the Service announced the introduction, use, and protection of
a US-CITES tag symbol. This symbol appears on every Service-approved export tag to provide legal evidence of U.S.
export approval for certain species listed on Appendix II of CITES. Hides marked with tags that lack this US-CITES
symbol are not legally exportable from the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Guidelines developed for Management Authority findings on State-managed American alligator export programs,
under provisions of CITES Article IV.2(a), are summarized as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Current State alligator trapping, hide tagging, meat and parts processing, marking, and shipping regulations
must be on file with the Office of Management Authority; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Sample reporting forms, export tag, meat and parts packing seal, parts tag, and specifications of the State's
standard meat and parts package/container must be on file with the Office of Management Authority; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The hide export tag must be durable and permanently locking, and must show the US-CITES logo, State of origin, year
of take, species, and a unique serial number; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The export tag, meat seal, and parts tag or seal must be applied to all hides, meat, or parts within a minimum time
after take or processing as specified by State law and such time should be as short as possible to minimize movement
of untagged hides, meat, or parts; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) US-CITES tags must be inserted through the hide and permanently locked in place using the locking mechanism of
the tag and in accordance with State requirements; other tags or seals must be permanently attached as mandated by
the State; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) All American alligator harvesters and processors must be State registered; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) All American alligator hide, meat, and parts dealers must be State registered; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) All State-registered American alligator harvesters, processors, and dealers must make available their American
alligator harvest and commerce data to the State on at least an annual basis, as specified by the State; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) State-registered American alligator dealers and State licensed harvesters authorized to attach export tags
must account for tags received and must return unused tags to the State within a time specified by the State after the
taking season closes; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) When manufactured hide products are to be exported from the United States, the CITES export tags that were removed
from the hides contained in the products must be surrendered to the Service prior to export.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based upon: (1) The finding of nondetriment by the Scientific Authority, and (2) information available from the previously
export-approved States, the Service proposes to issue Management Authority approval for the export of American
alligators legally harvested during 1995&hyph;1997 from those States previously approved for such export, including
Arkansas.

Multiyear Findings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service has monitored existing State programs for the American alligator in most of the previously approved States
for many years and expects these States will continue to satisfy CITES requirements. States seeking for the first
time to establish a harvest program for alligators should apply for CITES export approval no later than January 2 of
the year before they plan to initiate such a program. To ensure that export-approved States maintain successful programs
and that export is not detrimental to the survival of the species, the Service plans to continue annual monitoring
of State management and export marking programs through evaluation of State annual reports and export reports from
U.S. ports. Annual State program reports should be provided to the Office of the Management Authority (address given
above) for review no later than May 31 of each year.

Proposed Findings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service proposes to find that the status of the species and State programs is such that the 1995&hyph;1997 harvests
of American alligators for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
export will not be detrimental to the survival of the species. Accordingly, the Service proposes to approve exports
of 1995&hyph;1997 harvested alligators from the States previously approved for export, including Arkansas, on
the grounds that both Scientific Authority and Management Authority export requirements have been satisfied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comments Solicited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service requests comments on these proposed findings. Final findings will take into consideration the comments
and any additional information received, and such consideration may lead to final findings that differ from this
proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service requests information on environmental or economic impacts and effects on small entities (including
small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions) that would result from findings
for or against export approval. This information may aid the Service in further evaluating the conclusions stated
below. This proposal is issued under the authority of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Effects of the Rule and Required Determinations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service has determined that these proposed findings are not a major Federal action significantly affecting the
quality of the human environment under the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321&hyph;4347), and therefore
the preparation of an environmental impact statement is not required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866. For the 1995&hyph;97
harvest years, the Service analyzed the impacts and again concluded that the 3-year rule was not a major rule and did
not have significant economic effects on a substantial number of small entities as outlined under the Regulatory
Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.). Because the proposed rule treats exports on a State-by-State basis and proposes to approve export in accordance
with State programs, the rule would have little effect on small entities in and of itself. The proposed rule would allow
continued international trade in American alligators in accordance with CITES, and it does not contain any Federalism
impacts as described in Executive Order 12612. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It also has been determined that this proposed rule does not contain information collection requirements that require
approval by OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document is in response to a petition requesting the issuance of regulations that will establish specific protection
zones around every northern right whale (as well as around all other whales). It solicits public comment and information
to assist in determining the need for and types of conservation measures that would be effective in minimizing human-induced
disturbance of and harmful interaction with northern right whales.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The western North Atlantic population of northern right whales (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Eubalaena
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
glacialis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) is estimated to consist of 300&hyph;350 animals. Although protected by international agreements for over 50 years,
the growth rate of this population remains at an extremely low level relative to the growth rates of right whale populations
in the southern hemisphere that have been similarly protected (Kraus, 1990). It has been suggested that both natural
and human-induced factors are responsible for the absence of measurable growth in the northern right whale population.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One human-induced factor thought to be a substantial threat to the recovery of the northern right whale, as identified
in the Recovery Plan for Northern Right Whales (NMFS, 1991), developed under section 4(f) of the Endangered Species
Act (ESA), 16 U.S.C. 1533(f), is disturbance by vessels. Northern right whale behavior occurring at the water's surface,
such as resting, skim feeding, and courtship, makes them susceptible to disturbance by vessels. Further, it appears
that vessel traffic has a measurable effect on large whales, including right whales. These effects include overt
changes in direction of swimming, changes in respiration patterns, changes in dive time/surface time ratios, and
changes in acoustic behaviors. In particular, right whale cows with calves and single long-diving whales appear
to be sensitive to sound and have been observed to avoid boats (Kraus and Mayo, unpubl. data). Finally, turbulence
associated with vessel traffic may also indirectly affect northern right whales by breaking up the dense surface
zooplankton patches in certain whale feeding areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 5, 1994, NMFS received a petition from Greenworld, Inc. requesting that, in order to address this perceived
problem, NMFS issue regulations establishing a 500&hyph;yard (yd) (460 meter(m)) radius protection zone around
every right whale and, citing the similarity of appearance provision of section 4(e) of the ESA, 16 U.S.C. 1533(e),
a 100&hyph;yd (90m) radius protection zone around all other whales. The petition also suggested that any vessel approach
of a right whale closer than 500&hyph;yds (or 100&hyph;yds for other whales) be considered an incidental take under
the ESA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS has previously received information suggesting similar actions. During the comment period following the proposed
rule to designate critical habitat for the right whale (final rule at 59 FR 28793, June 3, 1994), several commenters
recommended that a distance buffer be established around each right whale. To allow whales to avoid oncoming vessels
and vessels to avoid whales, commenters indicated that, at the time of critical habitat designation, restrictions
or modifications of shipping lanes and shipping practices needed to be made. Another commenter suggested that a minimum
vessel approach distance of 100&hyph;300m be established around right whales. Finally, a commenter recommended
that NMFS establish a 500m radius protection zone around every right whale in every area designated as critical habitat,
and prohibit any person from knowingly entering or remaining within this zone. This commenter noted that such a buffer
would be consistent with rules already adopted by NMFS, citing, as examples, the minimum distance rules for humpback
whales (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Megaptera
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) in Hawaii (50 CFR 222.31) and the 5.5km (5500m) zone established around Steller sea lion rookeries and major haulouts
in Alaska (50 CFR 226.12). The commenter further explained that right whale protective zones for the areas proposed
to be designated as critical habitat in Cape Cod Bay and Stellwagen Bank would be consistent with existing Massachusetts
regulations (322 CMR 12.00 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.), which implement a 500&hyph;yd buffer zone between right whales and vessels and prohibit activities of vessels
that negatively impact right whales within Massachusetts waters. (Critical habitat for the northern right whale
was designated by final rule published on June 3, 1994 (59 FR 28793).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the petition and comments, NMFS is soliciting information from the public which confirms or rebuts the
proposition that disturbance from directed vessel interaction, other than collisions, can cause harm to right whales
that is detrimental to recovery of the species. Assuming disturbance from vessel interaction may be harmful, NMFS
seeks suggestions of appropriate measures to minimize the harmful effects of directed vessel interactions on northern
right whales, including possible exceptions and variations.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS announces the intention of the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council (Council) to prepare an EIS for proposed
Amendment 1 to the Atlantic Bluefish Fishery Management Plan (FMP). Current stock assessment information indicates
that bluefish are overfished, and the FMP contains no fishing mortality rate reduction strategy. Additional management
measures are necessary for both the recreational and the commercial fisheries. In the development of Amendment 1,
the Council proposes to consider additional management measures for both recreational and commercial fisheries
along with a reevaluation of existing management objectives. The Council also announces a public process for determining
the scope of issues to be addressed and for identifying the significant issues relating to revising the management
of bluefish. The purpose of this document is to inform the public of the commencement of a scoping process and to provide
the opportunity for public participation in the development of Amendment 1 to the FMP. All persons affected by, or
otherwise interested in, the proposed amendment are invited to participate in determining the scope of significant
issues to be considered in the EIS by submitting written comments. The scoping process also will identify and eliminate
from detailed study issues that are not significant.

The management unit for Atlantic bluefish (

saltatrix
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) is all bluefish in U.S. waters in the western Atlantic Ocean. Current stock assessment information indicates that
bluefish are overfished. Based on the overfishing definition in the FMP, the exploitation rate would have to be reduced
by 50 percent to end overfishing. Because the FMP contains no strategy for reducing fishing mortality, additional
management measures are necessary in both the recreational and the commercial fisheries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bluefish management is further complicated by the multi-species/multi-gear nature of the fishery. Any management
program developed for this Amendment must recognize that bluefish may continue to be caught and killed if these gears
continue to be fished, even though their use may be directed at other species.

Objectives
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Part of the scoping process is the possible reevaluation of the existing objectives. The major goal of the FMP is to
conserve the bluefish resource along the Atlantic coast. Five major objectives have been adopted to achieve this
goal: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Increase understanding of the stock and of the fishery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Provide the highest availability of bluefish to U.S. fishermen while maintaining, within limits, traditional
uses of bluefish (defined as the commercial fishery not exceeding 20 percent of total catch). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Provide for cooperation among the coastal states, the various Regional Marine Fishery Management Councils, and
Federal agencies involved along the coast to enhance the management of bluefish throughout its range. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Prevent recruitment overfishing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Reduce waste in both commercial and recreational fisheries.

Measures
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Possible management measures for the commercial fishery include, but are not limited to, minimum and/or maximum
fish size, minimum mesh size, closed seasons and areas, quotas (including adjustments among states), a moratorium
on vessels, individual transferable quotas, dealer and vessel permits and reports, operator permits, trip limits,
and gear restrictions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Possible management measures for the recreational fishery (including that sector of the fishery that carries recreational
fishermen for hire) include, but are not limited to, minimum and/or maximum fish size, maximum possession limit,
closed seasons and areas, gear restrictions, quotas (including adjustment among states), restrictions on the sale
of recreationally caught fish, dealer and vessel permits and reports, and operator permits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is anticipated that permits would be mandatory for: Vessels landing bluefish for sale; dealers purchasing bluefish
from permitted vessels; party and charter boats in the Atlantic bluefish fishery. Further, it is anticipated that
vessels landing bluefish for sale would need to submit logbooks; dealers purchasing bluefish from permitted commercial
vessels would need to submit reports; and operators of charter and party boats would need to submit logbooks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Paperwork Reduction Act forms (SF&hyph;83) prepared by NMFS for Amendment 2 to the Summer Flounder FMP, the
Dealer Purchase Report was estimated to involve 1,255 respondents and 26+ responses per respondent per year, for
a total of 33,135 responses at 0.0448 hours per response, for a total of 1,485 burden hours. The Vessel Logbook was estimated
at 1,314 respondents, 12 responses per respondent, at 0.08 hours per response, for a total of 1,261 burden hours. The
Vessel Permit was estimated at 24,943 annual responses at 0.2878 hours per response, for a total of 7,179 burden hours.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similar burden hours should be experienced through bluefish management. There may be a reduction because vessels
with summer flounder permits may qualify for the bluefish fishery. Currently, operating permits are required in
the Northeast Multispecies, Atlantic Sea Scallop, and Summer Flounder FMPs. It is expected that the burden hours
for the operator permit will be similar to those estimated for the Summer Flounder Operator Permit.

Timetable for EIS Preparation and Decisionmaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council has adopted a tentative amendment preparation, review, and approval schedule for Amendment 1. Under
this schedule, the Draft EIS is planned for completion prior to the Council's September 1995 meeting. If an acceptable
Draft is completed, the Council would decide at that meeting whether to submit the draft EIS for public review. Oral
comments to the Council on their decision could be made at that meeting. If the Council's decision is affirmative,
public review of the draft EIS would occur during 45 days in October and November 1995. At its January 1996 meeting,
the Council would decide on any revisions to the proposed management regime of bluefish, and oral comments on the decision
could be made to the Council at that meeting. If the Council's decision is affirmative, the EIS would be made final and
submitted with the amendment recommendation and other rulemaking documents to NMFS for review and approval. The
Council reserves the right to modify or abandon this schedule if necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Magnuson Act, NMFS review and approval of a proposed amendment is completed in no more than 95 days and includes
concurrent public comment periods on the amendment and proposed regulations. If approved by NMFS under this schedule,
the revised bluefish management measures would be effective in 1996.
