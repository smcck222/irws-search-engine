 The Board seeks public comment on a proposal to revise its interpretive rule regarding investment adviser activities
of bank holding companies to allow a bank holding company and its bank and nonbank subsidiaries to purchase in their
sole discretion in a fiduciary capacity, securities of an investment company advised by the holding company if this
purchase is specifically authorized by the terms of the instrument creating the fiduciary relationship, by court
order, or by the law of the jurisdiction under which the trust is administered.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In 1972, the Board permitted bank holding companies to serve as an investment adviser to mutual funds and other registered
investment companies. See 12 CFR 225.25(b)(4). When the Board added this activity to Regulation Y, it also published
an interpretive rule that placed certain prudential and other limitations on the manner in which bank holding companies
could conduct the activity. 12 CFR 225.125. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Among the restrictions in the interpretive rule is a requirement that a bank holding company and its bank and nonbank
subsidiaries should not purchase, in its sole discretion in a fiduciary capacity, any securities of an investment
company advised by the bank holding company. 12 CFR 225.125(g). The Board adopted the restriction because of concern
that a bank holding company might use its position as a fiduciary to support an investment company that the bank holding
company advised, to increase the asset size of the investment company or as a means of increasing advisory fees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of bank holding companies have recently indicated that a mutual fund advised by the bank holding company is
often the most cost-effective method of providing investment advice to customers and is increasingly attractive
to customers because a mutual fund provides customers with a readily marketable and easily valued investment product.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 These bank holding companies point out that a number of statutory and regulatory developments have occurred since
1972 that address the concerns that originally prompted the Board to adopt its prohibition on fiduciary purchases
by a bank holding company of shares of a mutual fund advised by the bank holding company. In light of these developments,
several bank holding companies have requested that the Board modify its current interpretive rule to permit bank
holding companies to purchase, on behalf of fiduciary customers, shares of mutual funds advised by the bank holding
company.

Since the Board adopted its investment advisory interpretive rule, Congress enacted section 23B of the Federal Reserve
Act, which specifically permits a bank or its subsidiary to purchase securities, as a fiduciary, from an affiliate
if such purchases are permitted by the instrument creating the fiduciary relationship, by court order, or by the law
of the jurisdiction governing the fiduciary relationship. In addition, in an analogous area, the Board since permitted
fiduciary purchases of securities that are underwritten by a section 20 affiliate if the purchase was specifically
authorized under the instrument creating the fiduciary relationship, by court order, or by the law of the jurisdiction
under which the trust is administered.

The Board now proposes to modify its investment advisory interpretive rule to provide that a bank holding company
and its bank and nonbank subsidiaries may purchase in their sole discretion in a fiduciary capacity, securities of
an investment company advised by the bank holding company if this purchase is specifically authorized by the terms
of the instrument creating the fiduciary relationship, by court order, or by the law of the jurisdiction under which
the trust is administered. To assure that fiduciary customers are aware of the potential conflicts of interest that
may arise, the proposed change would contain a requirement that the bank holding company disclose, in writing at the
time that the fiduciary relationship is created, to its fiduciary customer, that it, or an affiliate, serves as investment
adviser to the investment company whose shares are purchased in a fiduciary capacity. These purchases would also
be governed by fiduciary principles that require the purchase to be made on market terms. The Board seeks comment on
the proposed disclosure requirement and whether it is adequate to assure that fiduciary customers are aware of potential
conflicts of interest. In particular, the Board seeks comment on whether the required written disclosure should
be given to a fiduciary customer immediately prior to each initial investment in an investment company advised by
the bank holding company.

 The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) proposes to amend a provision of the Uniform Rules of Practice and
Procedure pertaining to ex parte contacts. The Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System (Board of Governors), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and Office of Thrift Supervision
(OTS) have all proposed to make this same change to the Uniform Rules, and are publishing separate notices of proposed
rulemaking. This proposal is intended to clarify that the Uniform Rules' provisions relating to ex parte communications
conform to the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). In particular, this proposal would clarify
that the ex parte provisions do not apply to intra-agency communications, which are governed by a separate provision
of the APA.

FR 37975, August 9, 1991; and OTS, 56 FR 38317, August 12, 1991). The NCUA and other agencies now independently propose
to amend one aspect of the Uniform Rules relating to ex parte communications to clarify that those rules parallel the
requirements of the APA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, section 747.9 of the Uniform Rules prohibits a party, the party's counsel, or another interested person
from making an ex parte communication to the NCUA Board or other decisional official concerning the merits of an adjudicatory
proceeding. When the Uniform Rules were proposed, the joint proposed rule (56 FR 27790, 27793) explained that the
proposed rule regarding ex parte communications ``adopts the rules and procedures set forth in the APA regarding
ex parte communications.'' There was no intention at that time to impose a rule more restrictive than that imposed
by the APA.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The APA contains two provisions relating to communications with agency decisionmakers. The APA's ex parte communication
provision restricts communications between ``interested person[s] 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
outside the agency''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and the agency head, the administrative law judge (ALJ), or the agency decisional employees. 5 U.S.C. 557(d) (emphasis
added). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Intra-agency
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 communications are governed by the APA's separation of functions provision, 5 U.S.C. 554(d). That section prohibits
enforcement staff at an agency from participating or advising in the decision, recommended decision, or agency review
of an adjudicatory matter pursuant to section 557 of the APA except as witness or counsel. The same separation of function
provision provides that the ALJ in an adjudicatory matter may not consult any party on a fact in issue unless the other
parties have an opportunity to participate. 5 U.S.C. 554(d)(1). The separation of functions provision does not prohibit
agency enforcement staff from seeking the amendment of a notice or the settlement or termination of a proceeding.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 747.9 of the Uniform Rules as proposed and adopted in 1991, however, commingled the ex parte and separation
of functions concepts, thereby allowing the ex parte communication prohibition to be applied to all communications
concerning the merits of an adjudicatory proceeding between the agency head, ALJ, or decisional personnel and any
party, the party's counsel, or another person interested in the proceeding. The NCUA and other agencies did not intend
this provision to limit agency enforcement staff's ability to seek approval of amendments to, or terminations of,
existing enforcement actions. As drafted, however, the provision could be misinterpreted to expand the ex parte
communication prohibition beyond the scope of the APA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment clarifies that the regulation is intended to conform to the provisions of the APA by limiting
the prohibition on ex parte communications to communications to or from ``interested persons outside the agency,''
5 U.S.C. 557(d), and by incorporating explicitly the APA's separation of functions provisions, 5 U.S.C. 554(d).
This approach is also consistent with the most recent Model Adjudication Rules prepared by the Administrative Conference
of the United States (ACUS). ACUS,

II. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the NCUA hereby certifies that this proposed rule will
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility
analysis is not required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal would make a minor amendment to a rule of practice already in place and affects intra-agency procedure
exclusively. Thus, it will not result in additional burden for regulated institutions. The purpose of the proposal
is to conform the provisions of the regulation to those imposed by statute.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule, like the current provision of Part 747 it is replacing, will apply to all federally insured credit
unions. The NCUA Board, pursuant to Executive Order 12612, has determined, however, that the proposed rule will not
have a substantial direct effect on the states, on the relationship between the national government and the states,
or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among various levels of government. Further, the proposed rule
will not preempt provisions of state law or regulations.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes to adopt a new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airworthiness directive (AD) that would apply to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain Beech Aircraft Corporation (Beech) Model F90, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 99, 100, and 200 series airplanes. The proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action would require installing a circuit breaker on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the landing gear motor control panel assembly. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report where excessive current flow caused the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electrical landing gear motor and wiring to catch fire 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on a Beech Model 200 airplane prompted the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action. The actions specified by the proposed AD are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended to prevent excessive current flow through the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electrical landing gear motor, which, if not corrected, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could cause an airplane fire.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has received a report where excessive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current flow caused the electrical landing gear motor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and wiring to catch fire on a Beech Model 200 airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Investigation revealed that the right main landing gear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actuator assembly jammed, causing the actuator to slow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or stall the landing gear motor. This caused the motor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to use excessive current, which caused smoke to fill 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the cockpit and cabin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other incidents where the landing gear motor used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excessive current have been reported; however, in these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incidents, airplane safety was not an issue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Beech has issued Service Bulletin No. 2035, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issued: February 1985; Revised: August 1990, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifies procedures for preparing the airplane for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installation of a circuit breaker on the landing gear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
motor control panel assembly of certain Beech Model 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F90, and 99, 100, and 200 series airplanes. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructions included with the following kits specify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructions for installing this circuit breaker: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
101&hyph;3069&hyph;1 S, 101&hyph;3069&hyph;3 S, 101&hyph;3069&hyph;5 S, and 101&hyph;3133&hyph;1 S.

all available information related to the incidents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described above, the FAA has determined that AD action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be taken to prevent excessive current flow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through the electrical landing gear motor, which, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not corrected, could result in an airplane fire. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is likely to exist or develop in other Beech Model F90, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 99, 100, and 200 series airplanes of the same type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design, the proposed AD would require installing a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circuit breaker on the landing gear motor control panel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assembly. The proposed action would be accomplished 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in accordance with Beech SB No. 2035, Issued: February 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1985; Revised August 1990; and the instructions to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable Landing Gear Motor Circuit Breaker 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Installation Kit (specified above). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 2,297 airplanes in the U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would take approximately 6 workhours (varies between 2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to 6 workhours depending on the airplane model) per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplane to accomplish the proposed action, and that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the average labor rate is approximately $60 an hour. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cost per parts varies by airplane model; however, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for purposes of this proposed AD, $1,000 is utilized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$3,137,702. This figure is based on the assumption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that no U.S. operator of the affected airplanes has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplished the proposed installation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Beech has informed the FAA that approximately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2,100 installation kits have been sold. Assuming that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each of these kits is installed on one of the affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplanes, the proposed cost impact on U.S. operators 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be reduced by $2,868,600 from $3,137,702 to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$369,102. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial direct effects on the States, on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relationship between the national government and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, or on the distribution of power and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibilities among the various levels of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promulgated, will not have a significant economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This document contains proposed regulations on the definition of private activity bonds applicable to tax-exempt
bonds issued by States and local governments. Changes to the applicable law were made by the Deficit Reduction Act
of 1984 (the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
1984 Act
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
), the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
1986 Act
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
), the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988, and the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. These regulations affect issuers of tax-exempt bonds and provide guidance for
applying the private activity bond restrictions.

I. Background of regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 103 provides generally that interest on certain States or local bonds (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
tax-exempt bonds
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) is excluded from gross income. Section 103(b)(1) provides, however, that private activity bonds (other than qualified
bonds) are not tax-exempt bonds. Section 141 provides that a bond is a private activity bond if the issue of which the
bond is a part satisfies either the private business tests or the private loan financing test. The private business
tests of section 141(b) are satisfied if the issue satisfies both the private business use test, which relates to the
use of the bond proceeds, and the private security or payment test, which relates to the manner in which the issue is
secured or will be repaid. Section 141(c) provides that the private loan financing test is satisfied if the lesser
of $5 million or 5 percent of the proceeds of an issue are to be used to make or finance loans to persons other than governmental
units.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations relating to the private business tests under section 103(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1954 Code
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the predecessor to section 141(b), are contained in &sect;1.103&hyph;7 (the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
industrial development bond regulations
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.) These regulations have not been amended since their finalization shortly after the enactment of section 103(b)
of the 1954 Code. Since 1972 many changes have occurred in the financing practices of State and local governments.
In addition, the 1984 Act and the 1986 Act made a number of significant changes to the private business tests. These
changes include reductions in the permissible amounts of private business use and private security or payments,
new limitations for certain types of bonds (for example, issues for output facilities), and modifications to the
private business use and private security or payment tests. Importantly, however, the 1986 Act legislative history
states that, to the extent not amended, principles of prior law continue to apply. The industrial development bond
regulations have not been amended to reflect the changes to the private business tests made in the 1984 Act or the 1986
Act. Finally, the industrial development bond regulations do not provide guidance on the private loan financing
test.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This document proposes to amend the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 1) by replacing the industrial development
bond regulations under &sect;1.103&hyph;7 with comprehensive regulations addressing the private business tests
and the private loan financing test. This document also contains proposed regulations that would replace other guidance
found in various pronouncements of the Service (for example, Notice 87&hyph;69, 1987&hyph;2 C.B. 378, Notice 89&hyph;9,
1989&hyph;1 C.B. 630, Rev. Proc. 93&hyph;17, 1993&hyph;1 C.B. 507, and Rev. Proc. 93&hyph;19, 1993&hyph;1 C.B.
526). This document also proposes certain related rules in the Income Tax Regulations, including rules for qualified
bonds under section 141(e), qualified 501(c)(3) bonds under section 145, arbitrage allocation rules under &sect;1.148&hyph;6,
definitions in &sect;1.150&hyph;1, changes in use under section 150 (b) and (c), and enterprises zone facility bonds
under section 1394. In the process developing the proposed regulations, the Internal Revenue Service and Treasury
considered the public comments received with respect to the industrial development bond regulations and other existing
guidance.

A. In general
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations substantially revise the industrial development bond regulations to provide more comprehensive
guidance, including numerous examples. Further, in contrast to the industrial development bond regulations, the
rules and definitions in the proposed regulations, the rules and definitions in the proposed regulations are coordinated
with the rules in the arbitage regulations under section 148 and the rules in section 150 that apply generally for tax-exempt
bond purposes.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations generally provide a number of definitions that apply for all purposes of section 141. Further,
for many terms, the definitions that apply for arbitrage purposes are made applicable for purposes of section 141.
Selected definitions are discussed below.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Proceeds.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed regulations define proceeds as including sale proceeds, disposition proceeds, and any replaced amounts.
Further, proceeds include earnings on nonpurpose investments that accrue during the project period but generally
exclude sale proceeds used to retire the issue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Replaced amounts.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The industrial development bond regulations do not specifically address when amounts that are replaced by bond proceeds
are treated as proceeds under section 141. The proposed regulations provide that certain replacement proceeds (as
defined for arbitrage purposes) are treated as proceeds for purposes of section 141.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Disposition proceeds.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The industrial development bond regulations also do not specifically address the application of the provisions
of section 141 after the issue date. The proposed regulations provide that disposition proceeds, defined as amounts
derived from the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property financed with the proceeds of an issue, are treated
as proceeds of the issue. Under this approach, the property transferred generally ceases to be allocable to proceeds
of the bonds and is no longer taken into account under section 141. Instead, the amounts received from the transfer
of the property are treated as proceeds of the issue for purposes of analyzing continuing compliance with the private
activity bond limitations. In order to provide administrative simplicity for issuers of large, multiproject financings,
the proposed regulations provide a special exception for property financed with certain general obligation issues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

5. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Partnerships.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under the private business tests, use of proceeds by any person other than a natural person is treated as trade or business
use. The proposed regulations provide rules for determining under which circumstances use by a partnership is disregarded
and, instead, treated as use by the partners of that partnership.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

C. Section 1.141&hyph;2&blank;Private activity bond tests

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An issue must satisfy both the private business use test and the private security or payment test for the bonds of the
issue to be private activity bonds under the private business tests of section 141(b). Alternatively, bonds are private
activity bonds if the private loan financing test of section 141(c) is satisfied.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reasonable expectations and deliberate actions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The industrial development bond regulations do not specifically address the effect of actions taken after the issue
date. The proposed regulations generally provide that whether bonds are private activity bonds is determined on
the basis of the issuer's reasonable expectations on the issue date. An issuer's reasonable expectations are determined
in the same manner as under the arbitrage regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations also provide that a deliberate action by the issuer occurring subsequent to the issue date
and resulting in satisfaction of the private activity bond tests causes the bonds to be private activity bonds. Importantly,
many post-issuance transfers will not result in private activity bond characterization if the issuer does not use
the disposition proceeds in an impermissible manner.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General rules.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under the private business tests, a bond is a private activity bond only if the issue of which it is a part satisfies the
private business use test of section 141(b)(1). The private business use test of section 141(b)(1) is met if more than
10 percent of the proceeds of the issue is used in a trade or business carried on by a nongovernmental person. Any use
by a person other than a natural person is treated as use in a trade or business. The industrial development bond regulations
relating to the private business use test do not provide specific guidance for many common situations that arise in
municipal financings.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General definition of private business use.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A principal goal of the proposed regulations is to provide more complete rules to identify whether proceeds, or the
facilities financed with those proceeds, are used for a private business use. The proposed regulations provide that
use of proceeds generally results from ownership or leasing of financed property, a loan of proceeds, or other actual
or beneficial use of financed property under a management or incentive payment contract, output contract, or other
arrangement. As under the industrial development bond regulations, private business use can result from either
direct or indirect use of the proceeds as well as from either the ultimate use of the proceeds or an intermediate use
of the proceeds.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discharge of primary legal obligation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed regulations provide that a bond-financed facility is indirectly used by a nongovernmental person if
the provision of that facility discharges a primary and unconditional obligation of the nongovernmental person.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Management contracts.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For management and other incentive payment contracts, the proposed regulations implement the directive of section
1301(e) of the 1986 Act and liberalize the safe harbors contained in Rev. Proc. 93&hyph;19. The proposed regulations
provide that management contracts other than qualified management contracts result in private business use of the
related facility. The proposed regulations expand the categories of qualified management contracts to include
the following: (a) Contracts with terms not exceeding the lesser of 15 years or 50 percent of the useful life of the property
if all the compensation is based on a periodic fixed fee; (b) contracts with terms not exceeding the lesser of 10 years
or 80 percent of the useful life of the property if at least 80 percent of the annual compensation is based on a periodic
fixed fee; (c) contracts with terms not exceeding 5 years if at least 50 percent of the compensation is based on a periodic
fixed fee; and (d) contracts with terms not exceeding 3 years if all of the compensation is based on a per-unit fee. The
proposed regulations make a number of other changes in the qualified management contract rules in response to comments
received with respect to Rev. Proc. 93&hyph;19.

Exception for general public use.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed regulations provide more complete guidance, including certain bright line tests and numerous examples,
for purposes of determining whether use is use as a member of the general public. These rules include a definition of
general public use, guidance on the circumstances when general public use is insubstantial, special rules for system
improvements, and guidance for facilities that are integrally related to other facilities.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
De minimis exceptions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In order to simplify the application of the private business use test, the regulations provide that certain de minimis
uses are disregarded. First, leases and similar arrangements that are not renewed or renewable and have terms of less
than 1 year are generally disregarded. Second, certain temporary use by developers of property that will be sold to
the general public is also disregarded in applying the private business use test. Third, as under Notice 87&hyph;69,
both incidental uses of a financed facility and qualified improvements of a facility are disregarded. The proposed
regulations revise the qualified improvement exception to simplify the application of these rules.

1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General rules.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under the private business tests, a bond is a private activity bond only if the issue of which it is a part satisfies the
private security or payment test of section 141(b)(2). The private security or payment test relates to the security
for, and the source of the amounts used to pay, debt service on the bonds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Application.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed regulations provide that the private security or payment test is applied by comparing the present value
of the private payments and security to the present value of the debt service on the issue. Present values are computed
using the yield on the issue as determined under the arbitrage regulations, with special rules provided for variable
yield issues. The private security or payment test is generally met if more than 10 percent of the principal of and interest
on the issue in the aggregate is to be secured or derived from certain property or payments described below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Private payments.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The private payments taken into account are payments, whether to the issuer or any related party, in respect of property
or borrowed money to be used for a private business use. Generally, any payments made by persons that satisfy the private
business use test are taken into account and the payments taken into account cannot exceed the corresponding proportion
of proceeds used by that person. In addition, payments from persons that are not private business users are taken into
account if those payments are made in respect of a private business use. For example, payments by the general public
for use of a facility that is managed by a nongovernmental person under a management contract that is not a qualified
management contract are taken into account as private payments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Private security test.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Private security includes any interest in property to be used for a private business use or payments in respect of property
or borrowed money to be used for a private business use that secures principal of and interest on the issue. Unlike private
payments, private security is taken into account if privately used property is the security for the bonds even if that
property is not financed with the proceeds of the issue.

 The proposed regulations provide that generally applicable taxes are disregarded under the private security or
payment test. Generally applicable taxes do not include special assessment or payments for a special privilege granted
or service rendered. Generally applicable taxes must have a general manner of determination and collection. The
regulations provide guidance on whether this requirement is satisfied if the taxpayer makes special arrangements
with respect to the tax (for example, agreements to be personally liable for a tax).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under the private loan financing test, a bond is a private activity bond if issued as part of an issue more than 5 percent
of the proceeds of which (or $5 million, if less) are used to make loans to nongovernmental persons. As with the private
business tests, both direct and indirect uses of proceeds are taken into account.

Definition of loan. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any transaction that is treated as a loan for federal tax purposes is a loan of proceeds. Generally, transactions that
result in an expenditure of proceeds, such as a grant, do not give rise to a loan. However, tax increment and similar
financings, in which proceeds are, in form, granted to a nongovernmental person with the debt service on the bonds
to be paid from incremental tax revenues may be treated as a loan if the recipient of the grant makes special agreements
regarding payment of the taxes (for example, an agreement not to contest the assessment).

Tax assessment bond exception. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 141(c) provides that certain tax assessment loans are not treated as loans in applying the private loan financing
test. A tax assessment loan is a loan that arises from the imposition of a tax or assessment of general application for
specific, essential governmental functions. The proposed regulations generally define essential governmental
function to have the same meaning as under section 7871. To qualify for this special exception, owners of business
and nonbusiness property must be eligible to make assessment payments on an equal basis. Guidance is provided on the
types of special arrangements regarding payment of an assessment that cause the assessment to fail the equal basis
requirement (for example, due-on-sale clauses). The proposed regulations clarify that loans qualifying under
the tax assessment loan exception may still result in satisfaction of the private business tests.

Measurement of private business use. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations provide specific rules regarding the measurement of private use. For facilities that are
simultaneously used for both private business use and government use, the regulations generally permit the use of
reasonable methods of measuring the private business use. Thus, for a building with separate portions used for private
business use and government use, the amount of private business use is based on the relative portion of useable space
used for a private business use. If the private use occurs at different times, the private business use is based on a
comparison of private business use to total use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Except as described below for output facilities, annual periods are used to measure the amount of private business
use and the private business use is equal to the greatest amount of private business use in any annual period. As under
the industrial development bond regulations, the proposed regulations do not provide that private business use
is measured over the entire term of the issue, except for output facilities. For example, a stadium that is used for
private business use 30 days out of a total use of 200 days in one year generally meets the 10 percent private business
use test (regardless of the use of the facility in other years).

Financing a portion of a mixed use facility. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a facility is used for private business use in an amount that would cause the bonds to be private activity bonds, in
many circumstances the proposed regulations permit tax-exempt bonds to be issued for the government use portion
without causing the bonds to meet the private business use test. This special rule applies only if the government use
portion of the facility is a separate and discrete portion of a facility (such as a floor of a building), or an undivided
ownership interest in an output or similar utility facility. In applying this rule, an allocable portion of the cost
of common areas may be financed as government use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generally, if the private business use of facility does not occur in a separate and discrete portion of the facility
or in an output or similar utility facility, the proposed regulations do not permit tax-exempt financing of any portion
of that facility. For example, for a stadium used 30 percent of the time for private business use, tax-exempt bonds
may not be issued to provide 70 percent of the cost of that stadium.

General rule. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations adopt the approach of the industrial development bond regulations providing special rules
for the determination of whether the purchase of the output of an output facility by a nongovernmental person causes
the bonds to be private activity bonds. These rules apply the private business use test to output contracts by comparing
the amount of output purchased by nongovernmental persons under take or take or pay contracts to the available output
of the facility. The proposed regulations provide certain additional clarifications. For example, the proposed
regulations clarify that certain requirements contracts are treated as take or take or pay contracts. Transitional
rules are provided for existing contracts. In modifying the rules for output facilities, the Service and Treasury
recognize that, as a result of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, significant regulatory changes are occurring regarding
electric generation and transmission facilities. In this regard, the proposed regulations attempt to address the
changing nature of this industry. For example, the proposed regulations provide guidance on allocations of use of
transmission facilities.

The proposed regulations contain several de minimis exceptions under which output contracts are disregarded. First,
in lieu of the 3 percent de minimis rule in the industrial development bond regulations, the proposed regulations
adopt a 1 percent de minimis rule. The proposed regulations also incorporate the safe harbors in the 1986 Act legislative
history relating to pooling, exchange, and spot sale agreements. Special rules are also provided for use of transmission
facilities. Finally, contracts with terms not exceeding 1 year may be disregarded in certain circumstances.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 141(b)(4) provides a special private activity bond limitation for issues used to finance output facilities,
under which the permissible private business use and private security or payments are limited to $15 million. Further,
this $15 million limitation for an issue is reduced by the amount of private business use and private security or payments
in other outstanding tax-exempt bonds financing the same project.

located at the same site or not placed in service within 3 years are not part of the same project. In addition, improvements
made more than 3 years after a generating unit is placed in service are treated as a separate project. For transmission
facilities, a project includes functionally related or contiguous property placed in service during a single 24-month
period.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 141(b)(3), an issue meets the private business tests if the amount of private business use and private
security or payments attributable to any unrelated or disproportionate private business use exceeds 5 percent of
the proceeds. The proposed regulations provide that whether private business use is related to a government use of
the proceeds of an issue is determined on a case-by-case basis, emphasizing the operational relationship of the financed
facilities. Generally, facilities used for a private business use are related to a government use only if the private
use occurs in the same facility or an adjacent facility. The proposed regulations also provide that a single facility
that is used for both a government use and a private business use of the same type (for example, governmental and private
parking) generally does not result in unrelated use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Disproportionate private business use occurs when the amount of proceeds used for a private business use exceeds
the amount of proceeds used for the related government use. The proposed regulations provide allocation rules designed
to simplify the application of the disproportionate use rules. For example, where a private business use relates
to more than one government use, in determining the amount of disproportionate use the private business use may be
allocated either entirely to the government use to which it primarily relates or among each of the government uses.
A number of examples are provided illustrating the application of the unrelated and disproportionate use rules.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations provide certain limited guidance for purposes of applying the provisions of section 141(e),
relating to qualified private activity bonds (private activity bonds that qualify as tax-exempt bonds). Thus, generally,
continued compliance throughout the term of the issue is required for bonds to be qualified bonds. The proposed regulations
provide, however, that certain of the remedial actions under proposed &sect;1.141&hyph;13 apply for this purpose.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Remedial actions
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Although a post-issuance deliberate action by an issuer may cause bonds to be private activity bonds, the proposed
regulations provide a number of remedial actions that will prevent bonds from ceasing to be tax-exempt bonds. In order
to be eligible for these remedial actions the issue must satisfy certain conditions. First, the issuer must covenant
in the bond documents that it will not take any action that would cause the bonds to be private activity bonds, and must
establish reasonable procedures to ensure compliance with this covenant. Second, the terms of any agreement that
would cause the bonds to be private activity bonds must be arm's-length. Third, as under the arbitrage regulations,
the issuer must certify its expectations as of the issue date regarding the amount and use of the proceeds. If, however,
the possibility that a deliberate action would be taken is not remote as of the issue date, remedial actions are generally
not available unless the bonds provide for redemption within 6 months of the deliberate action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Permitted remedial actions
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The proposed regulations contain several remedial actions that are available in the event of a deliberate action.
First, the issuer can redeem or defease the nonqualifying bonds. Second, the issuer is permitted to use the amounts
received on the disposition of a facility for a use that would qualify for tax-exempt financing as qualified 501(c)(3)
bonds. Similarly, in certain circumstances, if the transferred facility would itself continue to be eligible for
tax-exempt bond financing, that use is treated as a qualifying remedial actions. For this purpose, in applying section
55 through 59, 141 through 147, 149, and 150, the bonds are treated as reissued on the date of the deliberate action.
Treasury and the Service are considering alternative ways in which the requirements of section 55 through 59 could
be satisfied for this purpose (for example, a closing agreement with the issuer similar to the one described below).
These rules are based on, but are more flexible than, the safe harbors in Rev. Porc. 93&hyph;17. For example, qualifying
alternative uses of the financed facility would include uses under section 142. Finally, the proposed regulations
provide the Commissioner with the authority to provide additional remedial actions by publication in the Internal
Revenue Bulletin.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Consideration of alternative remedial action
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Defeasing bonds generally results in an issuer foregoing much of the ongoing benefit provided by tax-exempt financing.
In lieu of providing for defeasing as a remedial action, a more direct remedial action is being considered. Treasury
and the Service are considering the issuance of a revenue procedure pursuant to which an issuer may request a closing
agreement with respect to outstanding bonds. Under the closing agreement, the issuer would make a payment to the Service
to prevent the interest on bonds from being includable in gross income of bondholders as a result of a deliberate action
that results in satisfaction of the private activity bond test. Generally, the closing agreement would be conditioned
upon satisfying the requirements of &sect;1.141&hyph;13(a) (relating to conditions for remedial action). If this
procedure is adopted, defeasance of bonds would no longer be a permissible remedial action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The issuer would be required to make the payment within 30 days of the execution of the closing agreement. The amount
of the payment would equal the present value of the interest rate differential (as described below) multiplied by
the amount of nonqualified bonds that will be outstanding for each annual period (or shorter period) subject to the
closing agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interest rate differential would equal an appropriate factor multiplied by the difference between the applicable
federal rate under section 1274(d) (the applicable taxable rate) and the applicable federal rate under section 1288(b)
(the applicable tax-exempt rate). The factor would reflect that the applicable taxable rate is based on obligations
of the United States. The rates used would be those in effect on the date the deliberate action occurs. Each rate (that
is, the short-term, mid-term, or long-term rate) would be based on the remaining weighted average maturity of the
nonqualified bonds.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amount of the payment would be increased by 20 percent in cases where (1) the bond may be redeemed in accordance with
its terms or (2) the establishment of a defeasance escrow would not satisfy the requirements of &sect;1.141&hyph;13(b)(4)
(relating to defeasance of nonqualified bonds) as proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nonqualified bonds would have the same meaning as in &sect;1.141&hyph;13(g)(1), except that in the case of a transfer
for cash as defined in &sect;1.141&hyph;13(b)(1), the determination of the nonqualified bonds would be based on
an amount equal to the disposition proceeds. Nonqualified bonds that continue to be treated as tax-exempt because
of a permissible remedial action under &sect;1.141&hyph;13 (b), (c), or (d) (for example, because of a permissible
redemption) would not be treated as nonqualified bonds for purposes of the closing agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To enter into the agreement, the issuer also would have to agree to (1) redeem the nonqualified bonds on the earliest
date on which the bonds may be redeemed under their terms, (2) not make any payment under the closing agreement from
bond proceeds as described in section 103(a) of the Code, and (3) comply with &sect;1.141&hyph;14 with respect to
any refunding of the nonqualified bonds. In limited situations where it is foreseeable that the issuer, using its
best efforts, will be unable to redeem the bonds at the earliest date, the Commissioner may permit the bonds to remain
outstanding until a later date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, for cases in which the conditions of &sect;1.141&hyph;13(a) are not satisfied, the amount required to be
paid under the closing agreement would be based on the highest marginal individual income tax rate at the time of the
deliberate action and the interest paid or accrued on the nonqualified bonds from the issue date. If the noncompliance
occurred or was expected to occur as of the issue date, the nonqualified bonds would include all the bonds of the issue.

The proposed regulations provide certain limited guidance for purposes of applying the provisions of section 145,

is determined based on the issuer's reasonable expectations as of the issue date, although deliberate actions may

for the expenditure of bond proceeds, the proceeds of the issue are accounted for under a specific tracing method.
An issuer would be required to account for the allocation of proceeds to expenditures not later than 18 months after
the later of the payment of the expenditure and the date the project financed by the issue is placed in service. In no
event may the allocation occur after the first arbitrage rebate installment payment would be due for the issue.

Good faith compliance. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposed regulations, an issue is treated as satisfying certain of the requirements of section 1394 if the
issuer and each principal user in good faith attempt to meet those requirements throughout the term of the issue, and
any failure to comply with these requirements is corrected within a reasonable period after the failure is first discovered.
The proposed regulations provide guidance on the application of this good faith standard. Generally, correction
of noncompliance within one year of discovery is reasonable if the issuer and principal user are using their best efforts
to correct the noncompliance.

Effective Dates
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations are proposed to apply to bonds issued on or after the date 60 days after the adoption of final regulations.
The regulations do not apply to bonds issued on or after the effective date to refund a bond that was not subject to these
private activity bond regulations unless the refunding issue extends the weighted average maturity of the financing.
Under various transition rules, issuers may apply certain of the proposed rules on earlier dates. Before the adoption
of the regulations, the Service will continue to consider requests for rulings in the case of changes of use in which
the safe harbors provided in Rev. Proc. 93&hyph;17 are not satisfied.

Special Analyses
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in
EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply
to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f)
of the Internal Revenue Code, this notice of proposed rulemaking will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy
of the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business.

Comment is solicited on all aspects of the proposed regulations. In addition, comment is specifically solicited
on the following topics:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) the desirability of adopting the closing agreement procedure for noncompliance in lieu of providing for defeasance,
other situations in which the closing agreement procedure, if adopted, should apply, and whether other procedures
should be available to issuers;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) the condition that, in order to take certain remedial actions, certain bonds must contain early redemption provisions;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) additional limitations on the application of the disposition proceeds rules to reduce administrative burdens
on issuers and whether the disposition proceeds rules should apply for purposes of section 148;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) problems resulting from rules binding an issuer to the form of its transaction (see, for example,

(5) the application of the private security or payment test to variable yield issues;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) other circumstances in which issuers should be permitted to finance the government use portion of a mixed use facility;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) the required consistency between arbitrage and private activity bond allocations of proceeds;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) the treatment of requirements contracts as output contracts; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) safe harbors for provisions of the regulations requiring determinations of reasonableness or fair market value.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
transfer
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) of property (other than investments) financed with the proceeds of an issue. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Unless the issuer elects otherwise, disposition proceeds do not arise on the transfer of property financed with the
proceeds of a general obligation program if the requirements of this paragraph (c)(3) are satisfied. A general obligation
program is an issue of general obligation bonds issued by a general purpose governmental unit that finances more than
75 discrete facilities or projects. The requirements of this paragraph (c)(3) are satisfied if_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The transferred property had an original cost not in excess of the greater of $3,000,000 and 2.5 percent of the issue
price of the issue;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The transferred property is sold for its fair market value in a transaction other than an installment sale;

Overview.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Interest on a private activity bond is not excludable from gross income under section 103(a) unless the bond is a qualified
bond. The purpose of the private activity bond tests of section 141 is to limit the volume of tax-exempt bonds that finance
the activities of nongovernmental persons, without regard to whether a financing actually transfers benefits of
tax-exempt financing to a nongovernmental person. The private activity bond tests serve to identify arrangements
that have the potential to transfer the benefits of tax-exempt financing, as well as arrangements that actually transfer
these benefits. The regulations under section 141 may not be applied in a manner that is inconsistent with these purposes.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Sections 1.141&hyph;1 through 1.141&hyph;16 apply generally for purposes of the private activity bond limitations
under section 141. In addition, as specifically provided, certain provisions of &sect;&sect;1.141&hyph;1 through
1.141&hyph;16 apply for purposes of other limitations on tax-exempt bonds under sections 142 through 150.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General definition of private activity bond.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under section 141, bonds are private activity bonds if they meet either (1) the private business use and private payment
or security tests of section 141(b) or (2) the private loan financing test of section 141(c). The private business
use and private security or payment tests are described in &sect;&sect;1.141&hyph;3 and 1.141&hyph;4. The private
loan financing test is described in &sect;1.141&hyph;5.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An issue is an issue of private activity bonds if the issuer reasonably expects, as of the issue date, that the issue
will meet either (i) the private business tests, or (ii) the private loan financing test. An issue is also an issue of
private activity bonds if the issuer takes a deliberate action, subsequent to the issue date, that causes the conditions
of either the private business tests or the private loan financing test to be met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Deliberate actions defined.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In general, a deliberate action is any action taken by the issuer that is within its control. An intent to violate the
requirements of section 141 is not necessary for an action to be deliberate. Except as otherwise provided in the next
sentence of this paragraph (d)(2), an action that would be treated as involuntary under section 1033 is not a deliberate
action. Any action is treated as a deliberate action if the financed facility was designed differently, sized larger,
built sooner, or constructed in a more costly manner than is reasonably necessary for the governmental purposes of
the issuer. A deliberate action occurs on the earlier of the date the parties agree on the consideration for the new
use or the date on which the new use occurs.

Example 1.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 City B issues bonds to finance the purchase of land. On the issue date, B reasonably expects that it will be the sole user
of the land for the entire term of the bonds. Subsequently, the federal government acquires the land in a condemnation
action. B sets aside the condemnation proceeds to pay debt service on the bonds but does not redeem them on their first
call date. The bonds are not private activity bonds because B has not taken a deliberate action after the issue date.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The private business use test relates to the use of the proceeds of an issue. The 10 percent private business use test
of section 141(b)(1) is met if more than 10 percent of the proceeds of an issue is used in a trade or business carried on
by a nongovernmental person. For this purpose, the use of financed property is treated as the use of proceeds. This
section also applies to the private business use test under sections 141(b)(3) (unrelated or disproportionate use),
141(b)(4) ($15 million limitation for output facilities), and 141(b)(5) (the coordination with the volume cap where
the nonqualified amount exceeds $15 million).

Indirect use. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In determining whether an issue meets the private business use test, indirect as well as direct use of the proceeds
is taken into account. For example, the issuer's use of the proceeds to engage in a series of financing transactions
for property to be used by nongovernmental persons in their trades or businesses may cause the private business use
test to be met. In addition, proceeds are treated as used in the trade or business of a nongovernmental person in situations
involving other arrangements, whether in a single transaction or in a series of related transactions, whereby a nongovernmental
person uses property acquired with the proceeds of an issue in its trade or business.

Ultimate and intermediate use. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In determining whether an issue meets the private business use test, both the ultimate and intermediate uses of proceeds
are taken into account. For example, a facility is treated as being used for a private business use if it is leased to
a governmental person and then subleased to a nongovernmental person or if it is leased to a governmental person and
subleased to a governmental person, provided in each case that the nongovernmental person's use is in a trade or business.

In general.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Proceeds are used for a private business use if they are used in a trade or business carried on by a nongovernmental person.
For this purpose, any activity carried on by a person other than a natural person is treated as a trade or business. See

or (iii) has actual or beneficial use of financed property under a management or incentive payment contract, output
contract, or other arrangement.

 Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3) or (f) of this section, the lease of a financed facility is treated as a use of
that facility for purposes of the private business use test. For this purpose, any arrangement, such as a management
contract, that is properly characterized is a lease for federal income tax purposes is treated as a lease.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The contract is not a qualified management contract (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section); or

General rule.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In general, a nongovernmental person is treated as a user of a financed facility if the financing of that facility discharges
a primary and unconditional legal obligation of that nongovernmental person, even if the nongovernmental person
has no possession or control of the facility. Further, the use resulting from the discharge of a primary legal obligation
is not use as a member of the general public within the meaning of paragraph (e) of this section. A primary legal obligation
does not include a law of general application (for example, an ordinance requiring that all businesses properly dispose
of hazardous waste). An obligation imposed on the owner of a facility is not the primary obligation of any other user
of that facility.

undertake to create District, a political subdivision. District issues its tax assessment bonds, the proceeds of
which are used, in part, to construct the street and sidewalk improvements that N is obligated to construct. N's obligation
to construct the improvements is unconditional and, therefore, the discharge of that obligation results in private
business use of the proceeds used to construct those improvements.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A management contract is a qualified management contract if it meets the requirements of paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3),
and (c)(4) of this section. See also paragraphs (c)(5) and (e) of this section for de minimis exceptions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General compensation requirements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The contract must provide for reasonable compensation for services rendered with no compensation based, in whole
or in part, on a share of net profits from the operation of the facility. Reimbursement of the service provider for actual
and direct expenses paid by the service provider to unrelated parties is not by itself treated as compensation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Compensation based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) a percentage of gross revenues (or adjusted gross revenues) of a facility or a percentage of expenses from a facility,
but not both,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) a capitation fee, or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) a per-unit fee is generally not considered to be based on a share of net profits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Similarly, a productivity reward equal to a stated dollar amount based on increases or decreases in gross revenues,
reductions in total expenses, but not both, generally does not cause the compensation to be based on a share of net profits.

100 percent periodic fixed fee arrangements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All of the compensation for services during the term of the contract is based on a period fixed fee and the term of the
contract, including all renewal options, does not exceed the lesser of 50 percent of the expected useful life of the
related property and 15 years. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(3)(i) and paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section,
a fee does not fail to qualify as a periodic fixed fee as a result of a single incentive award provision under which compensation
automatically increases when a gross revenue or expense target (but not both) is reached if that award is equal to a
single, stated dollar amount.

Either at least 50 percent of the compensation for services for each annual period during the terms of the contract

of a capitation fee and a periodic fixed fee. The term of the contract must not exceed 5 years, including all renewal
options. The contract must be terminable by the governmental persons upon reasonable notice at the end of the third
year of the contract term, without penalty or cause.

All of the compensation for services is based on a per-unit fee or a combination of a per-unit fee and a periodic fixed
fee. The contract has a term, including renewal options, that is not longer than 3 years. The contract must be terminable,
by the governmental person on reasonable notice, without penalty or cause, at the end of the second year of the contract
term. The amount of the per-unit fee must be specified in the contract or otherwise specifically limited by the government
person or an independent third party, such as the administrator of the Medicare program.

All the compensation for services is based on a percentage of fees charged or a combination of a per-unit fee and a percentage
of revenue or expense fee. During the start-up period, however, compensation may be based on a percentage of either
gross revenues, adjusted gross revenues, or expenses of a facility. The contract must have a term, including renewal
options, that is not longer than 2 years. The contract must be terminable by the governmental person on reasonable
notice, without penalty or cause, at the end of the first year of the contract term. This paragraph (c)(3)(v) applies
only to contracts under which the service provider primarily provides services to third parties (for example, radiology
services), or service contracts involving a facility during an initial start-up period for which there have been
insufficient operations to establish a reasonable estimate of the amount of the annual gross revenues and expenses
(for example, a contract for general management services for the first year of operations).

No related parties or common control.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The service provider must not have any role or relationship with the governmental person that, in effect, substantially
limits the governmental person's ability to exercise its rights, including cancellation rights, under the contract.

De minimis exception for functionally related use. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The use of a financed facility pursuant to a qualified management contract does not result in use of the financed facility
for purposes of the private business use test if that use is functionally related and subordinate to that management
contract and that use is not, in substance, a separate contractual agreement (for example, a separate lease of a portion
of the financed facility). Thus, for example, exclusive use of storage areas by the manager for equipment that is necessary
for it to perform its required activities does not give rise to private business use.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Definitions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of this paragraph (c), the following definitions apply:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Adjusted gross revenues 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
means gross revenues of all or a portion of a facility, less allowances for bad debts and contractual and similar allowances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Capitation fee 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
means a fixed periodic amount for each person for whom the service provider or the governmental person assumes the
responsibility to provide all needed services for a specified period so long as the quantity and type of services actually
provided to covered persons varies substantially. For example, a capitation fee includes a fixed dollar amount payable
per month to a medical service provider for each member of a health maintenance organization plan for whom the provider
agrees to provide all needed medical services for a specified period. A capitation fee may include a variable component
of up to 20 percent of total compensation designed to protect the service provider against risks such as catastrophic
loss.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Periodic fixed fee 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
means a stated dollar amount for services rendered for a specified period of time. For example, a stated dollar amount
per month is a periodic fixed fee. The stated dollar amount may automatically increase according to a specified, objective,
external standard that is not linked to the output or efficiency of a facility. For example, the Consumer Price Index
and similar external indices that track increases in prices in an area or increases in revenues or costs in an industry
are objective external standards. Capitation fees and per-unit fees are not periodic fixed fees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Per-unit fee 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
means a fee based on a unit of service provided. For example, a stated dollar amount for each specified medical procedure
performed, car parked, or passenger mile is a per-unit fee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Renewal option 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
means a provision under which the service provider has a legally enforceable right to renew the contract. Thus, for
example, a provision under which a contract is automatically renewed for one-year periods absent cancellation by
either party is not a renewal option (even if it is expected to be renewed).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Management contract 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
means a management, service, or incentive payment contract between a governmental person and a service provider
under which the service provider provides services involving all, a portion of, or any function of, a facility. For
example, a management or incentive payment service contract includes a contract for the provision of management
services for an entire hospital, management services for a specific department of a hospital, or an incentive payment
contract for physician services to patients of a hospital. Management contracts do not include a customary contract
for janitorial or similar services. The mere granting of admitting privileges by a hospital to a doctor does not result
in a management contract even if those privileges are conditioned on the provision of de minimis services, if those
privileges are available to all qualified physicians in the area, consistent with the size and nature of its facilities.
A contract to provide for the operation of a mixed use facility described in &sect;1.141&hyph;6(b)(2)(i)(B) (relating
to certain undivided ownership interests) is not a management contract if the only compensation is the reimbursement
of actual and direct expenses paid by the service provider.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Service provider 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
means any person other than a governmental person that provides services under a contract to or for the benefit of a
governmental person.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Penalties 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
for terminating a contract include a limitation on the governmental person's right to compete with the service provider;
a requirement that the governmental person purchase equipment, goods, or services from the service provider; and
a requirement that the governmental person pay liquidated damages for cancellation of the contract. In contrast,
a requirement effective on cancellation that the governmental person reimburse the service provider for ordinary
and necessary expenses or a restriction on the governmental person against hiring key personnel of the service provider
is generally not a contract termination penalty. The existence of another contract between the service provider
and the governmental person, such as a loan or guarantee by the service provider, constitutes a contract termination
penalty if that contract contains terms that are not customary or arm's-length that could operate to prevent the governmental
person from terminating the contract (for example, provisions under which the contract terminates if the service
contract is terminated or that place substantial restrictions on the selection of a substitute service contract
provider).

Corporate-sponsored research.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A research agreement relating to a facility used for basic research supported or sponsored by a nongovernmental person
is described in this paragraph (d)(2) if any license or other use of resulting technology by the sponsor is permitted
only on the same terms as the recipient would permit that use by any unrelated, nonsponsoring party (that is, the sponsor
must pay a competitive price for its use), with the price paid for that use determined at the time the license or other
resulting technology is available for use. Although the recipient need not permit persons other than the sponsor
to use any license or other resulting technology, the price paid by the sponsor must be no less than the price that would
be paid by any non-sponsoring party.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A research agreement relating to a facility used pursuant to a joint industry-university cooperative research arrangement
is described in this paragraph (d)(3) if_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Multiple, unrelated sponsors agree to fund university-performed basic research;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The research to be performed and the manner in which it is to be performed (for example, selection of the personnel
to perform the research) is determined by the university;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Title to any patent or other product incidentally resulting from the basic research lies exclusively with the
university; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Sponsors are entitled to no more than a nonexclusive, royalty-free license to use the product of any of that research.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
basic research
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 has the same meaning as under section 41(e)(7)(A) (that is, any original investigation for the advancement of scientific
knowledge not having a specific commercial objective, except that this term does not include basic research conducted
outside the United States or basic research in the social sciences, arts, or humanities). Basic research does not
include applied or practical research, product development, or similar activities.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Use of a financed facility by nongovernmental persons in their trades or businesses is treated as general public

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The facility is intended for use by the general public; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Number of users.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A facility is not intended for use by the general public if less than 25 percent of the reasonably expected direct use
of the facility is by persons that individually account for no more than 1 percent of the use of the facility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Persons constituting the general public.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Although the general public ordinarily includes natural persons not engaged in trades or businesses, the general
public may consist entirely of a large number of nongovernmental persons engaged in different types of trades or businesses.
The general public cannot consist predominately of a large number of nongovernmental persons engaged in the same
type of trade or business. For example, an electric transmission line used by a large number of electric utilities
is not used by the general public. See, however, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

(A) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General rule.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The use of a financed facility by a nongovernmental person is not on the same basis as use by the general public if the
financed facility is functionally and integrally related to another facility that is used by that nongovernmental
person (the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
primary facility
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and significant economic benefits with respect to the primary facility arise from the use of the related facility
that are not available to the general public. If more than 75 percent of the use of the related facility is by the general
public and not use in connection with the primary facility, the benefits to the primary facility are treated as insignificant
for this purpose.

Functionally and integrally related.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Generally, a facility is not functionally and integrally related to a primary facility for this purpose if it is not
a necessary component of the primary facility. Examples of facilities that are typically functionally and integrally
related to other facilities in a manner that results in significant economic benefits are parking lots at airports,
stadiums, and shopping centers, and utility and other infrastructure improvements for a new development, stadium,
or airport. On the other hand, a parking lot in a large urban business district where there are many separate businesses
typically does not produce significant benefits to any particular person.

Priority rights or other preferential benefits.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Use under an arrangement that conveys priority rights or other preferential benefits is not use on the same basis as
the general public. Arrangements for a term of more than one month generally convey preferential benefits. Arrangements
providing for use that is available to the general public at no charge or on the basis of rates that are generally applicable
and uniformly applied do not convey priority rights or other preferential benefits. For this purpose, rates may be
treated as generally applicable and uniformly applied even if_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Different rates apply to different classes of users, such as volume purchasers, if the differences in rates are
customary and reasonable;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Users are permitted to reserve short-term or incidental use in advance;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Existing users, each using less than 1 percent of a financed facility, possess rights of first refusal to renew
their use at generally applicable, fair market value rates that are in effect at the time of renewal; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) A specially negotiated arrangement is entered into, but only if the user is prohibited by federal law from paying
the generally applicable rates, and the terms of the arrangement are as comparable as reasonably possible to the generally
applicable rates.

Special rules for system improvements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For improvements to existing public utility or infrastructure systems such as roads or sewers, but not discrete structures
such as parking facilities (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
system improvements
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), whether the use of a system improvement is general public use may be determined by reference to the system as a whole
if the system improvement is insubstantial, based either on aggregate cost or scope relative to the system as a whole
within the jurisdiction of the issuer. Except in the case of improvements to roads, a system improvement is insubstantial
for this purpose if the cost of the system improvement is less than 5 percent of the cost of the system as a whole. In addition,
in determining whether the use of a system improvement by the general public is insubstantial, paragraph (e)(3)(i)
of this section (relating to use related to other facilities) does not apply.

Example 1. Governmentally owned and operated hotel.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 State C issues its bonds to purchase land and construct a hotel for use by the general public (that is, tourists, visitors,
business travelers, etc.). The bond documents provide that C will own and operate the project for the period required
to redeem the bonds. Use of the hotel by hotel guests who are travelling in connection with trades or businesses of nongovernmental
persons is not a private business use of the hotel by these persons because it is general public use.

Example 2. Toll road.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 State D issues its bonds to finance the construction of a toll road and the cost of erecting related facilities such
as gasoline service stations and restaurants. These related facilities represent less than 10 percent of the total
cost of the project and are to be leased or sold to nongovernmental persons. The road is to be owned and operated by D.
The bonds do not satisfy the private business use test since less than 10 percent of the proceeds is to be used, directly
or indirectly, in the trades or businesses of nongovernmental persons. The fact that vehicles owned by nongovernmental
persons engaged in their trades or businesses may use the road in common with, or as a part of, the general public, is
not material.

 G, a sewage collection and treatment district, operates facilities that were financed with its bonds. F, an agency
of the United States, has a base located within G. Approximately 20 percent of G's facilities are used to treat sewage
produced by F under a contract under which G uses its best efforts to charge F as closely as possible the same amount for
its use of G's services as its other customers pay for the same amount of services, although those other customers pay
for services based on standard district charges and tax levies. The use of G's facilities by F is general public use.

Authority P uses all the proceeds of its bond issue to construct a parking garage containing more than 100 spaces located
in the central business district of a large urban area. At least 90 percent of the spaces in the garage will be available
to the general public on an hourly, daily, or monthly first-come, first-served basis and the Authority reasonably
expects that at least 25 of the spaces will be leased by unrelated individuals. Individual lessees of monthly parking
spaces may renew their spaces at then current fair market value rates. The bonds do not satisfy the private business
use test because at least 90 percent of the use of the parking garage is general public use.

of systems that are used on the same basis by members of the general public. The stadium is owned by nongovernmental
persons. Although the improvements to the highway and the local street are available to the general public and not
limited to persons going to the stadium, more than 75 percent of the use of the ramp will be used in connection with the
stadium (that is, employees, spectators, and other users of the stadium). Thus, these improvements are functionally
and integrally related to the stadium. Under these facts, however, the ramp qualifies as an insubstantial system
improvement and, therefore, the proceeds of H's bonds are not used for a private business use.

Example 6. Airport runway. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Airport Authority I, a political subdivision, issues its bonds and uses all of the proceeds to finance construction
of a runway at a new city-owned airport. The runway will be available for take-off and landing by any operator of an aircraft
desiring to use the airport. It is reasonably expected that more than 25 percent of the use of the runway (that is, direct
use of the runway) will be by private air carriers (both charter airlines and commercial airlines) in connection with
their use of the airport terminals leased by those carriers. Use of the runways by the private carriers is not on the
same basis as the general public because their lease of property that is functionally and integrally related to the
runways (the terminals) results in significant economic benefits from runway use that are not available to other
users. The use by these private air carriers is not general public use, and the proceeds of I's bonds are used for a private
business use.

prisoners on a space-available, first-come, first-served basis, pursuant to which the federal agency will be charged
approximately the same amount for each prisoner as other governmental persons that enter into similar transfer agreements.
It is reasonably expected that other governmental units will enter into similar agreements. P may terminate the contract
on 90 days notice. it is reasonably expected that during the term of the contract, federal prisoners will constitute
more than 10 percent of the prisoners at the prison. The bonds satisfy the private business use test because F and any
governmental persons using the prison under similar agreements are not members of the general public.

operators of different types of hazardous businesses within the meaning of State law. Each of the insured persons
is required under State law to obtain this type of insurance as a condition to their trade or business operations. Each
participant receives insurance for a term of one year, and it is expected that the fund will be available for renewals.
The participants are not treated as members of the general public because the term of the insurance conveys preferential
benefits.

Highway Authority W uses all $200 million of the proceeds of its bonds to construct a 25-mile road to connect an industrial
port owned by Corporation C with existing roads owned and operated by W that are all located within City T. Other than
the port, the nearest residential or commercial development to the new road is 12 miles away. Although there may be
additional development in the area surrounding the new road, there is no reasonable expectation that the development
will occur within the 3-year period following the issuance of the bonds. W does not reasonably expect that more than
25 percent of the use of the new road will be by persons other than employees and other persons doing business with C.
The bonds satisfy the private business use test because the road, although available for use by the general public,
will have insubstantial general public use and will not qualify as an insubstantial system improvement because the
cost of the project is not insubstantial.

 J, a political subdivision, owns and operates a hydro-electric generation plant and related facilities. Pursuant
to a take or pay contract having a term equal to the useful life of the facility, J sells 15 percent of the output of the
plant to Corporation K, an investor-owned utility. Under the license issued to J for operation of the plant, J is required
by federal regulations to construct various facilities for the preservation of fish and for public recreation. J
issues its obligations to finance the fish preservation and public recreation facilities. The financed facilities
provide no direct benefits to J or the purchasers of the electricity produced by the plant. Because K has no primary
legal or contractual obligation to provide the financed facilities, the facilities are not used for a private business
use by K under paragraph (b)(8) of this section. Under this paragraph (e), however, the fish preservation facilities,
but not the public recreation facilities, are treated as used by K because they are functionally and integrally related
to the generation plant.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The building was placed in service more than one year before the construction or acquisition of the improvement
is begun;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The bonds are private activity bonds under section 141(b)(1) and (2) since they are part of an issue (1) all of the proceeds
of which are to be used (by purchasing land and constructing and equipping the factory) in a trade or business by a nongovernmental

building to be constructed by D on land that it will acquire. D will occupy the street level floor and the remaining eight
floors of the building. The portion of the costs of acquiring the land and constructing the building that are allocated
to the space to be leased by Y is not in excess of 10 percent of the total costs of acquiring the land and constructing the
building. These costs, whether attributable to the acquisition of land or the construction of the building, were
allocated to leased space in the same proportion that the reasonable rental value of that leased space bears to the
reasonable rental value of the entire building. From the facts and circumstances presented, it is determined that
that allocation was reasonable. D issues $10 million of bonds, the proceeds of which will be used to purchase land and
construct the office building. The arrangement does not, by itself, cause the private business use test to be met because
not more than 10 percent of the proceeds is to be used, directly or indirectly, in the trade or business of a nongovernmental
person. See &sect;1.141.6.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If Corporation Y instead leases 2 floors, and the costs allocated to these floors are in excess of 10 percent of
D's investment in the land and building, the arrangement causes the private business use test to be met because more
than 10 percent of the building is to be used in the trade or business of a nongovernmental person.

of such a user are only those of a transient occupant, rather than the full legal possessory interest of a lessee. It
is anticipated that the auditorium will be used by schools, church groups, fraternities, and numerous commercial
organizations. The revenues from the rentals of the auditorium and the auditorium itself will be the security for

The contract meets the conditions for qualified management contracts under paragraph (c) of this section. However,
the contract also provides that L will guarantee M that 20 percent of the capacity of the hospital will be exclusively

The private business use of proceeds allocated to a facility under &sect;1.141&hyph;6 is determined according to
the use of that financed facility during each one-year period beginning from the later of the issue date or the date
the facility is placed in service. The private business use of a facility is equal to the greatest percentage of private

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Uses at different times. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For a facility in which the government use and private business use occur at different times (for example, on different
days), the average amount of private business use is based on the amount of time that the facility is used for private
business use as a percentage of total time for all use. If, however, the use of a facility during different times has
significantly different value, this determination must take into account those different values.

Simultaneous use.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For a facility in which government use and private business use occur simultaneously, the entire facility is treated
as having private business use. If, however, the private business use and government use is on the same basis, the average
amount of private business use may be determined on a reasonable basis (for example, relative value of use, relative
amount of time used). For example, a governmentally owned facility that is leased or managed by a nongovernmental
person in a manner that results in private business use is treated as entirely used for a private business use. On the
other hand, a garage with unassigned spaces that is used for government use and private business use is only partially
used for a private business use.

If a facility has private business use that is described in both paragraphs (i)(2)(i) and (1)(2)(ii) of this section,
the amount of private business use is determined according to whichever method produces the greatest amount of private
business use. See, however, &sect;1.141-6 for special rules for common areas of a discrete portion of a mixed use facility.

Commencement of private business use. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Generally, private business use commences on the first date on which there is actual use by the nongovernmental person.
If, however, the issuer and a nongovernmental person enter into an arrangement to transfer a financed facility, private
business use commences on the date of that arrangement if that arrangement was entered into substantially in advance
of the transfer and the transfer will occur during the final year of the term of the issue or after the retirement of the
issue.

Example 1. Research facility. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
University U is a state owned and operated university. As part of its activities, U owns and operates a bond-financed
research facility. U enters into sponsored research agreements with nongovernmental persons that result in private
business use. The research otherwise conducted by U (government use) and the private research will take place simultaneously
in all laboratories within the research facility. All laboratory equipment will be available continuously for use
by workers who will perform both types of research. A researcher will often use a single laboratory to perform identical
research that may meet the objectives of U's research and the obligations under the research contracts. Under this
section, the nongovernmental persons are using the facility for a private business use. The private business use
results from a use of the facility, the research, that is on the same basis as government use of the facility. Therefore,
the portion of the facility that is used for a private business use may be determined on a reasonable basis. If more than
10 percent of the use of the facility is private business use, no portion of the facility can be financed with tax-exempt
bonds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 2. Stadium. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
City L issues its obligations and uses all of the proceeds to construct a stadium. L enters into a long-term contract
with a professional sports team T under which T will use the stadium 20 times during each year. These uses will occur
on weeknights and weekends. L reasonably expects that the stadium will be used more than 180 other times each year,
none of which will give rise to private business use. This expectation is based on a feasibility study and historical
use of the old stadium that is being replaced by the new stadium. There is no significant difference in the value of T's
uses when compared to the other uses of the stadium. Assuming no other private business use, the obligations do not
satisfy the private business use test of section 141(b)(1) on the issue date since not more than 10 percent of the use
of the facility is for a private business use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 3. Stadium with significant private business use. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The facts are the same as in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 2, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
except that L reasonably expects that more than 10 percent of the use of the stadium will be for a private business use.
The obligations satisfy the private business use test. Further, since the stadium is not a mixed use facility under
&sect;1.141&hyph;6, any obligations issued to finance any portion of the stadium are treated as having private business
use in excess of 10 percent. Therefore, no portion of the stadium can be financed with tax-exempt bonds.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Private security or payment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The private security or payment test relates to the nature of the security for, and the source of, the payment of debt
service on an issue. The private payment portion of the test takes into account the payment of the debt service on the
issue that is directly or indirectly to be derived from payments (whether to the issuer or any related party) in respect
of property, or borrowed money, used or to be used for a private business use. The private security portion of the test
takes into account the payment of the debt service of the issue that is directly or indirectly secured by any interest
in (i) property used or to be used for a private business use, or (ii) payments in respect of property used or to be used
for a private business use.

Aggregation of private payments and security. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of the private security or payment test, payments taken into account as private payments and payments
or property taken into account as private security are aggregated. However, the same payments are not taken into account
as both private security and private payments. For example, the 10 percent private security or payment test is met
if, in the aggregate, the payments taken into account as private payments and the property or payments taken into account
as private security exceed 10 percent of the debt service on the bonds, provided no payment is taken into account under
both portions of the test.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General rule. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The security for, and payment of debt service on an issue is determined from the terms of the bond documents and on the
basis of any underlying arrangement. An underlying arrangement may result from separate agreements between the
parties or may be determined on the basis of all the facts and circumstances surrounding the issuance of the bonds.
If the payment of debt service on an issue is secured by both a pledge of the full faith and credit of a State or local governmental
unit and any interest in property used or to be used in a private business use, the issue satisfies the private security
or payment test. For special rules for output facilities, see &sect;1.141&hyph;7.

Use of present value. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In determining whether an issue meets the private security or payment test, the present value of the payments or property
taken into account is compared to the present value of the debt service to be paid over the term of the issue.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Debt service paid from proceeds
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Adjustments to debt service
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Debt service is adjusted to take into account payments and receipts that adjust the yield on an issue for purposes
of section 148(f). For example, debt service includes fees paid for qualified guarantees under &sect;1.148&hyph;4(f)
and is adjusted to take into account payments and receipts on qualified hedges under &sect;1.148&hyph;4(h).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Present values are determined by using the yield on the issue as the discount rate and by discounting all amounts to
the issue date. For a fixed yield issue, yield is determined on the issue date and is not adjusted to take into account
subsequent events.

Variable yield issues
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

. The yield on a variable yield issue is determined over the term of the issue. To determine the reasonably expected
yield as of any date, the issuer may assume that the future interest rate on a variable yield bond will be the then-current
interest rate on the bonds determined under the formula prescribed in the bond documents. Unless a change in interest
rate results in a new issuance, changes in interest rates do not constitute deliberate actions.

In general. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Both direct and indirect payments made by any nongovernmental person that is treated as using proceeds of the issue
are taken into account as private payments to the extent allocable to the proceeds used by that person. Payments for
a use of proceeds include payments (whether or not to the issuer) in respect of property financed (directly or indirectly)
with those proceeds, even if not made by a private business user. Payments are not made in respect of property financed
with proceeds if those payments are directly allocable to other property being directly used by the person making
the payment, but only to the extent that those payments are reasonable compensation for that other use. See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Payments not to exceed use
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Payments by a person for a use of proceeds are allocable to the payment of the debt service on the proceeds used by that
person (or with respect to property used by that person) to the extent that the present value of those payments does
not exceed the present value of the debt service on those proceeds. Thus, if 7 percent of the proceeds of an issue is used
by a person, payments by that person are taken into account as private payments only to the extent that the present value
of those payments does not exceed the present value of 7 percent of the debt service on the issue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Payments for operating expenses
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Payments by a person for a use of proceeds do not include the portion of any payment that is properly allocable to the
payment of ordinary and necessary expenses (as defined under section 162) directly attributable to the operation
and maintenance of the financed property used by that person. For this purpose, general overhead and administrative
expenses are not directly attributable to those operations and maintenance. For example, if an issuer receives $5,000
rent during the year for use of space in a financed facility and pays $500 during the year for ordinary and necessary
expenses properly allocable to the operation and maintenance of that space, $500 of the $5,000 received would not
be considered a payment for the use of the proceeds allocable to that space (regardless of the manner in which that $500
is actually used).

Refinanced debt service
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

(

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) the present value of the debt service to be paid on the refunding issue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) For example, if all the debt service on a note is paid with proceeds of a refunding issue, the note meets the private
security or payment test if (and to the same extent that) the refunding issue meets the private security or payment
test. This paragraph (c)(2)(ii) does not apply to deliberate actions that occur more than 3 years after the retirement
of the prior issue that are not reasonably expected on the issue date of the refunding issue. For purposes of this paragraph
(c)(2)(ii), whether an issue is a refunding issue is determined without regard to &sect;1.150&hyph;1(d)(2)(i)
(relating to certain payments of interest).

a facility are aggregated in determining the portion of the loan repayments taken into account as private payments.

Secured by any interest in property or payments
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Property used or to be used for a private business use and payments in respect of that property are treated as private
security if any interest in that property or payments secures the payment of debt service on the bonds. For this purpose,
the phrase 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
any interest in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is to be interpreted broadly and includes, for example, any right, claim, title, or legal share in property or payments.
However, in order for an interest in property or payments to be taken into account as private security, that interest
must secure the payment of debt service on the bonds.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Payments in respect of property
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The payments taken into account as private security are payments in respect of property used or to be used for a private
business use. Thus, to be taken into account as private security, payments need not be made by the private business
user. Therefore, payments made by members of the general public for use of a facility used for a private business use
may be taken into account as private security (for example, payments by persons using a facility that is the subject
of a management contract that results in private business use). Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d)(5)
and paragraph (d)(6) of this section, the rules in paragraph (c) of this section apply to determine the amount of payments
treated as payments in respect of property used or to be used for a private business use.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General rule.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For purposes of the private security or payment test, generally applicable taxes are not taken into account (that
is, are not payments from a nongovernmental person and are not payments in respect of property used for a private business
use).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Definition of generally applicable taxes.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A generally applicable tax is an enforced contribution exacted pursuant to legislative authority in the exercise
of the taxing power that is imposed and collected for the purpose of raising revenue to be used for governmental purposes.
A generally applicable tax must have a uniform tax rate that is applied to all persons of the same classification in
the appropriate jurisdiction, and a generally applicable manner of determination and collection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Special charges.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A payment for a special privilege granted or service rendered is not a generally applicable tax. Special assessments
paid by property owners benefiting from financed improvements are not generally applicable taxes. For example,
a tax that is limited to the property or persons benefitted by an improvement is not a generally applicable tax.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 Manner of determination and collection
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A tax does not have a generally applicable manner of determination and collection if one or more taxpayers make any
special agreements relating to payment of those taxes. A special agreement relating to the payment of a tax is taken
into account whether or not it is reasonably expected to result in any payments that would not otherwise have been made.
On the other hand, if an issuer uses proceeds to make a grant to a taxpayer to improve property, agreements that impose
reasonable conditions on the use of the grant do not cause a tax on that property to fail to be a generally applicable
tax. If an agreement by a taxpayer causes a tax to fail to have a generally applicable manner of determination and collection,
the entire tax paid by that taxpayer is treated as a special charge, unless the agreement is limited to a specific portion
of the tax.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Impermissible agreements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The following are examples of agreements that cause a tax to fail to have a generally applicable manner of determination
and collection: an agreement to be personally liable, to provide additional credit support such as a third party guarantee,
or to pay unanticipated shortfalls; an agreement regarding the minimum market value of property subject to property
tax; and an agreement not to challenge or seek deferral of the tax.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(iii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Permissible agreements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The following are examples of agreements that do not cause a tax to fail to have a generally applicable manner of determination
and collection: an agreement to use a grant for specified purposes (whether or not that agreement is secured); a representation
regarding the expected value of the property following the improvement, an agreement to insure the property and,
if damaged, to restore the property; and a right of a grantor to rescind the grant if property taxes are not paid.

(A) The payment is measured by and equal to the amounts imposed by a regular statute for a tax of general application;

Persons that are not private users. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Payments from nongovernmental persons who are not (other than coincidentally) either users of the site being remediated
or persons potentially responsible for disposing of hazardous waste on that site are not taken into account as private
security. This paragraph (f)(2) applies to payments that secure the payment of principal of, or interest on, the bonds
(directly or indirectly) under the terms of the bonds. This paragraph (f)(2) applies only if the payments are made
pursuant to either (i) a generally applicable state or local taxing statute, or (ii) a state or local statute that regulates
or restrains activities on an industry-wide basis of persons who are engaged in generating or handling hazardous
waste, or in refining, producing, or transporting petroleum, provided that those payments do not represent, in substance,
payment for the use of proceeds. For this purpose, a state or local statute that imposes payments that have substantially
the same character as those described in Chapter 38 of the Code are treated as generally applicable taxes.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Persons that are private users. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If payments from nongovernmental persons who are either users of the site being remediated or persons potentially
responsible for disposing of hazardous waste on that site do not secure the payment of principal of, or interest on,
the bonds (directly or indirectly) under the terms of the bond, the payments are not taken into account as private payments.
This paragraph (f)(3) applies only if at the time the bonds are issued the payments from those nongovernmental persons
are not material to the security for the bonds. For this purpose, payments are not material to the security for the bonds
if_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The payments are not required for the payment of debt service on the bonds;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The amount and timing of the payments are not structured or designed to reflect the payment of debt service on the
bonds;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The receipt or the amount of the payment is uncertain (for example, as of the issue date, no final judgment has
been entered into against the nongovernmental person);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The payments from those nongovernmental persons, when and if received, are used either to redeem bonds of the
issuer or to pay for costs of any hazardous waste remediation project; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) If a judgment (but not a final judgment) has been entered against a nongovernmental person by the issue date, there
are, as of the issue date, costs of hazardous waste remediation other than those financed with the bonds that may be
financed with the payments.

Example 1. Aggregation of payments. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
State B issues bonds with proceeds of $10 million. B uses $9.7 million of the proceeds to construct a 10-story office
building. B uses the remaining $300,000 of proceeds to make a loan to Corporation Y to finance unrelated privately
owned facilities. In addition, X leases 1 floor of the building for a significant period that is less than the term of
the bonds. As a percentage of the present value of the debt service on the bonds, the present value of Y's loan repayments
is 3 percent and the present value of X's lease payments is 8 percent. The bonds satisfy the private security or payment
test because the private payments taken into account are more than 10 percent of the present value of the debt service
on the bonds.

Example 2. Indirect private payments. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
J, a political subdivision of a state, will issue several series of bonds from time to time and will use the proceeds
to rehabilitate urban areas. More than 10 percent of the proceeds of each issue will be used for the rehabilitation
and construction of buildings that will be leased or sold to nongovernmental persons for use in their trades or business.
Nongovernmental persons will make payments for these sales and leases that have an aggregate present value that is
more than the present value of debt service on 10 percent of each issue. There is no limitation either on the number of
issues or the aggregate amount of bonds that may be outstanding. No group of bondholders has any legal claim prior to
any other bondholders or creditors with respect to specific revenues of J, and there is no arrangement whereby revenues
from a particular project are paid into a trust or constructive trust, or sinking fund, or are otherwise segregated
or restricted for the benefit of any group of bondholders. There is, however, an unconditional obligation by J to pay
the principal of and interest on each issue. The bonds meet the private security or payment test because all of the private
payments are counted.

Example 3. Allocations of payments. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
City Z purchases property for $1,250,000 using $1,000,000 of proceeds of its tax increment bonds and $250,000 of other
revenues that are in its redevelopment fund. The bonds are secured only by the incremental property taxes on the property
attributable to the increase in value of the property from the planned redevelopment of the property. Z will reimburse
the redevelopment fund from amounts paid from the resale of the property. After clearing the property, Z sells it to
Developer M for $250,000, an amount not in excess of the fair market value of the land, which Z uses to reimburse the redevelopment
fund. Although M uses the property financed with the proceeds of the bonds, it also directly uses property that was
not financed with those proceeds. The payments by M are properly allocable to the property financed with the amounts
in Z's redevelopment fund. Accordingly, the issue does not meet the private security or payment test because of M's
$250,000 payment. See paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section.

Example 4. Payments in respect of bond financed property. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to further public safety, City Y issues $5,000,000 of its tax assessment bonds the proceeds of which are used
to move existing electric utility lines underground. Although the utility lines are owned by a nongovernmental utility
company, that company is under no obligation to move the lines. The debt service on the bonds will be paid using assessments
levied by City Y on the customers of the utility. Although the utility lines are privately owned and the utility customers
make payments to the utility company for the use of those lines, the assessments are payments in respect of the cost
of relocating the utility line. Thus, the assessment payments are not made in respect of property used for a private
business use. Any direct or indirect payments to Y by the utility are, however, taken into account as private payments.

City P issues general obligation bonds to finance the renovation of a hospital that it owns. The hospital is operated
for P by D, a nongovernmental person, under a management contract that results in private business use under &sect;1.141&hyph;3.
P will use the revenues from the hospital (after the required payments to D) to pay the debt service on the bonds. The
bonds satisfy the private security or payment test because the revenues from the hospital are payments in respect
of property used for a private business use.

Example 6. Lease financing. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) County W issues certificates of participation in a lease of a building that W owns and covenants to appropriate
annual payments for the lease. A portion of each payment is specified as interest. More than 10 percent of the building
is used for private business use. None of the proceeds of the obligations are used with respect to the building. W uses
more than 10 percent of the proceeds of the obligations to construct a stadium that is to be used for a private business
use. If W defaults under the lease, the trustee for the holders of the certificates of participation has a limited right
of repossession under which the trustee may not foreclose but may lease the property to a new tenant at fair market value.
The obligations are secured by an interest in property used for a private business use and, therefore, the obligations
satisfy the private security for payment test.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 except that, under the terms of the lease, in the event of a default by W, the trustee's only rights are to sue W for any
failure to make payments pursuant to the lease. Thus, the trustee has no rights to the building and no limited right
of repossession. The right to receive lease payments is not an interest in the leased property and, therefore, this
right does not provide private security.

Example 7. Limitation of payments to use not determined annually. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
City Q issues bonds with a term of 15 years and uses the proceeds to construct an office building. The debt service on
the bonds is level throughout the 15-year term. O enters into a 5-year lease of 11 percent of the building with Corporation
R under which R will make lease payments equal to 20 percent of the annual debt service on the bonds for each year of the
lease. The present value of R's lease payments is equal to 12 percent of the present value of the debt service over the
entire 15-year term of the bonds. If, however, the lease payments taken into account as private payments were limited
to 11 percent of debt service paid in each year of the lease, the present value of these payments would be only 8 percent
of the debt service on the bonds over the entire term of the bonds. The bonds satisfy the private security or payment
test, because R's lease payments are taken into account as private payments in an amount not to exceed 11 percent of
the debt service on the bonds over the term of the bonds (rather than 11 percent per year).

Example 8. Parity bonds. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
University L, a political subdivision, issued three separate series of revenue bonds during 1989, 1991, and 1993
under the same bond resolution. L used the proceeds to construct facilities exclusively for its own use. Bonds issued
under the resolution are equally and ratably secured and payable solely from the income derived by L from rates, fees,
and charges imposed by L for the use of the facilities. The bonds issued in 1989, 1991, and 1993 are not private activity
bonds. In 1995, L issues another series of bonds under the resolution to finance additional facilities. L enters into
10-year leases for 20 percent of the new facilities with nongovernmental persons who will use the facilities in their
trades or businesses. The present value of the lease payments from the nongovernmental users will equal 15 percent
of the present value of the debt service on the 1995 bonds. L will commingle all of the revenues from all its bond-financed
facilities in its revenue fund. The portion of the lease payments from nongovernmental lessees of the new facilities
allocable to the 1995 bonds under &sect;1.148&hyph;6(e)(6) is less than 10 percent of the present value of the debt
service on the 1995 bonds. The 1995 bonds will meet the private security or payment test because the private lease payments
for the new facility are properly allocated to those bonds (that is, because none of the proceeds of the prior issues
were used for the new facilities).

Example 9. Variable yield issues. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) City M issues general obligation bonds with proceeds of $10 million to finance a 5-story office building. The bonds
bear interest at a variable rate that is recomputed monthly according to an index that reflects current market yields.
They yield that the interest index would produce on the issue date is 6 percent. M leases one floor of the office building
to Corporation T, a nongovernmental person, for the term of the bonds. Using the 6 percent yield as the discount rate,
M reasonably expects on the issue date that the present value of lease payments to be made by T will be 8 percent of the
present value of the total debt service on the bonds. After the issue date of the bonds, interest rates decline significantly,
so that the yield on the bonds over their entire term is 4 percent. Using this actual 4 percent yield as the discount rate,
the present value of lease payments made by T is 12 percent of the present value of the actual total debt service on the
bonds. The bonds are not private activity bonds because M reasonably expected on the issue date that the bonds would
not meet the private security or payment test and because M did not take any subsequent deliberate action to meet the
private security or payment test.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
except that 5 years after the issue date M leases a second floor to Corporation S, a nongovernmental person, under a
long-term lease. On the date this lease is entered into M reasonably expects that the yield on the bonds over their entire
term will be 5.5 percent, based on actual interest rates to date and the then-current rate on the variable yield bonds.
Using this 5.5 percent yield as the discount rate, as a percentage of the present value of the debt service on the bonds,
the present value of lease payments made by T is 9 percent and the present value of the lease payments made by S is 2 percent.
The bonds are private activity bonds because M has taken a subsequent deliberate action that causes the bonds to meet
the private security or payment test.

(i) Authority issues its bonds to finance the construction of a stadium. Under a long-term lease, Corporation X, a
professional sports team, will use more than 10 percent of the stadium. Corporation X will not, however, make any payments
for this private business use. The security for the bonds will be a ticket tax imposed on each person purchasing a ticket
for an event at the stadium. The portion of the ticket tax attributable to tickets purchased by persons attending X's
events will, on a present value basis, exceed 10 percent of the present value of Authority's bonds. The bonds satisfy
the private security or payment test. The ticket tax is not a tax of general application and, to the extent that the tax
receipts relate to X's events, the taxes constitute payments in respect of property used for a private business use.

except that the ticket tax is imposed by Authority on tickets purchased for events at a number of large entertainment
facilities within the jurisdiction of Authority (for example, other stadiums, arenas, concert halls, etc.), some
of which were not financed with tax-exempt bonds. The ticket tax is a tax of general application and therefore the revenue
from this tax are not payments in respect of property used for a private business use. Therefore, the bonds do not satisfy
the private security or payment test.

of the proceeds is taken into account. Any use of proceeds by a governmental person that results in the expenditure
of those proceeds (rather than the acquisition of investment property), such as a grant, is treated as the ultimate
use of those proceeds. For purposes of this paragraph (a)(2), investment property has the meaning in &sect;1.148&hyph;1,

General federal tax principles apply
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Any transaction that, for federal income tax purposes generally, is characterized as a loan is a loan for purposes
of this section. Thus, the determination of whether a loan is made depends on the substance of a transaction. For example,
a lease or other contractual arrangement (for example, a management contract) may in substance constitute a loan
if the arrangement transfers tax ownership of the facility to a nongovernmental person. Similarly, an output contract
with respect to a financed facility generally is not treated as a loan of proceeds unless the agreement in substance
shifts significant burdens and benefits of ownership to the nongovernmental purchaser or manager of the facility.

. In the case of an issue of hazardous waste remediation bonds, payments from nongovernmental persons that are either
users of the site being remediated or persons potentially responsible for disposing of hazardous waste on that site
do not indicate a loan for purposes of this section. This paragraph (b)(3) applies only if those payments do not secure
the payment of principal of, or interest on, the bonds (directly or indirectly), under the terms of the bonds and those
payments are not taken into account under the private payment test pursuant to &sect;1.141&hyph;4(f)(3).

the definition of investment-type property under &sect;1.148&hyph;1, providing the benefits of tax-exempt financing
to the seller of the property or service is treated as an investment return to the issuer.

property is used by a nongovernmental person in its trade or business (whether or not private business use) or for nonbusiness

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

of the assessment on an equal basis (the

Mandatory tax or other assessment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An assessment is an enforced contribution that is imposed and collected for the purpose of raising revenue to be used
for a specific purpose (that is, to defray the capital cost of an improvement). Assessments must be levied on a property
frontage basis, an ad valorem basis, or any other comparable method that results in equivalent mandatory assessment
to all residents benefiting from the improvements in an amount proportionate to the benefit to the assessed property.
Assessments do not include fees for services.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
essential governmental function
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 has the same meaning as under section 7871. An essential governmental function does not include any function to the
extent that it is not customarily performed (and financed with governmental bonds) by governments with general taxing
powers. In determining whether an activity is customarily performed by a governmental unit, isolated instances
of bond financing are disregarded. Examples of specific essential governmental functions for purposes of this section
include street paving and street-light installation, sewage treatment and disposal, and municipal water facilities,
but not commercial or industrial ventures. A specific essential governmental function does not include permitting
installment payments of property taxes or other taxes or any improvement to property owned by a nongovernmental person.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An assessment does not satisfy the equal basis requirement if the terms for payment of the assessment are not the same
for all assessed persons (for example, if certain residents are permitted to pay the assessment over a period of years
while others must pay the entire assessment immediately or if the assessment is required to be prepaid when the property
is sold). In addition, the amounts payable and the rates used to determine those amounts must be determined on the basis
of non-discriminatory criteria. Thus, for example, an assessment does not satisfy the equal basis requirement if
imposed on a different basis for business and non-business beneficiaries. The equal basis requirement is not, however,
violated solely because an assessment varies on the basis of the relative benefit conferred.

invested in loans such as obligations of the United States during any available temporary period, as part of a reasonably
required reserve or replacement fund, as part of a refunding escrow, or as part of a minor portion (as each of those terms
is defined under &sect;1.148&hyph;1(b)) are not loans for purposes of this section. This paragraph (d) does not apply

 State agency Z and federal agency H will each contribute to rehabilitate a project owned by Z. H can only provide its
funds through a contribution to Z to be used to acquire the rehabilitated project on a turnkey basis from an approved
developer. Under H's turnkey program, the developer must own the project while it is rehabilitated. Z issues its notes
to provide funds for construction. A portion of the notes will be retired using the H contribution, and the balance
of the notes will be retired through the issuance by Z of long-term bonds. Z lends the proceeds of its note to Developer
B as construction financing and transfers title to B for a nominal amount. The conveyance is made on condition that
B rehabilitate the property and reconvey it upon completion, with Z retaining the right to force reconveyance if these
conditions are not satisfied. B must name Z as an additional insured on all insurance. Upon completion, B must transfer
title to the project back to Z at a set price, which price reflects B's costs and profit, not fair market value. Further,
this price is adjusted downward to reflect any cost-underruns. For purposes of section 141(c), this transaction
does not involve a private loan.

 Assessment district U issues bonds the proceeds of which are used to construct water and sewer improvements in the
district. At the time that the bonds are issued, all of the property in the district is owned by several developers,
each of which is in the trade or business of developing the property in the district for residential use. In accordance
with the procedures required by applicable State law, U imposes assessments on each parcel in the district. U requires
that, at the time that a developer sells a residential parcel, the developer must prepay the remaining amount of the
assessment. The assessments do not satisfy the equal basis requirement, because the payment terms are not the same
for all assessed persons.

State S and Corporation C enter into an agreement under which C will lease for 20 years the third and fourth floors of
an 11-story office building to be constructed on land that S will acquire. S will occupy the grade floor and the remaining
eight floors of the building. S will issue $10 million of bonds the proceeds of which will be used to finance 10/11ths
of the cost of the purchase of the land and construction of the building. S will use other funds for the remaining costs
of the land and building. From the facts and circumstances presented, it is determined that an allocation of the costs
of the acquisition of land and the construction of the building to the leased space based on the ratio of area leased
to the entire building is reasonable. Thus, no proceeds are allocated to 1 of the 2 floors used by C.

Special rules and definitions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For purposes of this paragraph (a) the following special rules and definitions apply:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Available output.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The available output of a facility is determined by multiplying the number of units produced or to be produced by the
facility in one year by the number of years in the contract term of the issue issued to finance that facility. The number
of units produced or to be produced by a generating facility in one year is determined by reference to its nameplate
capacity or the equivalent (or where there is no nameplate capacity or the equivalent, its maximum capacity) and is
reduced to account for scheduled maintenance but not for reserves or other unutilized capacity. If nameplate capacity
or the equivalent is greater than 150 percent of the average expected output during the contract term, average expected
output is used in lieu of nameplate capacity. For transmission facilities and cogeneration facilities, available
output must be measured in a reasonable manner. For example, for short, radial transmission lines, thermal capacity
may be reasonable. Similarly, for a transmission network, the use of load share ratios, in a manner consistent with
the requirements of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, may be reasonable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Contract term.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The contract term of an issue begins on the date the output facility is placed in service (but not earlier than the issue
date of the bonds), and ends on the final maturity date of the issue (determined without regard to any optional redemption
dates.) If a contract may be extended by the owner of the facility, the term of the contract includes the period for which
that contract may be so extended.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Refundings and extensions of maturity.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In determining the contract term and debt service on an issue under paragraphs (a)(2)(ii) and (a)(3)(ii) of this section
if, on or before the issue date of an issue to finance a facility, the issuer makes a commitment (for example, in the bond
documents) to refund that issue with a refunding issue, the contract term and debt service are based on the final maturity
date of any bond of the refunding issue (determined without regard to any optional redemption dates).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Take or take or pay contracts.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
take or pay contract 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
is a contract under which the purchaser agrees to pay for the output under the contract, whether or not that output is
received by the purchaser. A 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
take
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contract is a contract under which the purchaser agrees to pay for the output under the contract if the output facility
is capable of providing the service. In the case of a transmission facility, both agreements to provide firm transmission
services and agreements to provide transmission service comparable to the owner's own use are treated as a take or
take or pay contracts.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_(A) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An agreement by a nongovernmental person to purchase all of its output requirements (a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
requirements contract
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) is not a take or take or pay contract unless the purchaser agrees to pay a guaranteed minimum payment or if the purchaser
has no substantial ability to purchase its output requirements from other sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Requirements for certain contracts.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A requirements contract entered into on or after the date that is 60 days after publication of final regulations is
a take or take or pay contract if the purchaser has priority rights to the output (or rights to control the allocation
of the available output), if it is reasonably expected that the purchaser will purchase at least 10 percent of the available
output of the facility, or if the purchaser under the contract is a regulated utility that is in the business of reselling
output of the type purchased. For these purposes, to the extent that the amount of output under the contract does not
increase, a contract is treated as entered into before the date that is 60 days after publication of final regulations
notwithstanding an extension of the contract term or changes to other terms of the contract, provided that there is
no change, directly or indirectly, in the parties to the contract and the weighted average maturity of the bonds financing
the facility is not extended.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reasonable expectations determinations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The provisions of this paragraph (a) regarding renewals of output contracts and the issuer's requirements for output
from the facility are applied on the basis of the issuer's reasonable expectations as of the issue date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Benefits and burdens test not exclusive.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The benefits and burdens test of this section is not the exclusive means by which bonds financing output facilities
may satisfy the private business use or private security or payment tests. Thus, for example, an output facility that
is leased to a nongovernmental person may satisfy the private business use test.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pooling, exchange, spot sales, and wheeling arrangements_

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Swapping and pooling arrangements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An agreement that provides for swapping or pooling of power by one or more governmental persons and one or more nongovernmental
persons does not result in private business use of the output facility owned by the governmental person if_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Net importers.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (A) Under the agreement, on an annual basis and without regard to emergency consumption, the governmental person
is a net importer of power (for example, output produced at a particular facility that is owned by a governmental person
is provided to a nongovernmental person in exchange for output with a greater value to be delivered by the nongovernmental
person at a different location); and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The facilities are not designed differently, sized larger, built sooner, or constructed in a more costly manner
than is reasonably necessary for the ordinary customers of the owner of the facilities; or

Temporary outages, etc.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (A) The swapped power is approximately equal in value determined over periods of one year or less;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The agreement is not a take or take or pay contract; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(C) The purpose of the agreement is to enable each of the parties to satisfy different peak load demands or to accommodate
temporary outages.

(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Certain conduit parties disregarded.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The presence of a nongovernmental person acting solely as a conduit for the exchange of output among governmentally
owned and operated utilities is disregarded in determining whether the private business tests are satisfied with
respect to financed facilities other than those of the nongovernmental person.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Spot sales.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Spot sales of excess power capacity for temporary periods, other than pursuant to take or take or pay contracts, do
not result in private business use. For this purpose, a spot sale is a sale pursuant to a single agreement that is limited
to no more than 30 days' duration including renewal periods.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General rule.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Use of transmission facilities financed by an issue is not treated as private business use to the extent that it results
from an order or actions taken in response to (or to prevent) an anticipated order by the United States that those facilities
be used to provide transmission services to a particular nongovernmental person (including a requirement that the
owner or operator either purchase the output of a facility or provide transmission services). This paragraph (b)(4)
applies only if_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The transmission facilities were financed based on the issuer's reasonable expectations regarding the amount
of wheeling anticipated;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The terms of the transmission agreement are bona fide and arm's-length, and the new user pays consideration equal
to the fair market value for the use of the financed property (for example, as determined by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission); and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) No circumstances are present that indicate an attempt to avoid directly or indirectly the requirements of section
141.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Exceptions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This paragraph (b)(4) does not, however, apply to any transmission facilities (or portion thereof) that are_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Made necessary by the agreement to provide transmission service, including improvements needed due to increased
loads;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Designed differently, sized larger, built sooner, or constructed in a more costly manner than is reasonably necessary
for the ordinary customers of the owner of the transmission facilities; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) In excess of the services that are reasonably necessary to the purchaser of the output being transmitted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Special limitation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the transmission services provided under this paragraph (b)(4) involve more than 20 percent of the facility financed
with proceeds of the issue, paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section applies only if the issuer takes a remedial action
described in &sect;1.141&hyph;13 regarding the bonds allocable to that use. Paragraph (b)(4) of &sect;1.141&hyph;13
does not apply for this purpose. This paragraph (b)(4)(iii) does not apply if substantially all of the consideration
for providing the transmission services is the provision of other output property (for example, transmission).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Certain short term contracts.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The purchase of the output of an output facility by a nongovernmental person pursuant to an output contract is not treated
as private business use if:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) As of the later of the issue date or the date the contract is entered into, the issuer reasonably expects that at the
expiration of that agreement the related output will not be used for a private business use (determined without regard
to this paragraph (c)) and no subsequent deliberate actions are taken that are inconsistent with this reasonable
expectation;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The contract has a term not in excess of 1 year and cannot be renewed or extended beyond this 1-year term; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The facilities are not designed differently, sized larger, built sooner, or constructed in a more costly manner
than is reasonably necessary for the ordinary customers of the owner of the facilities.

Allocations of output facilities and systems_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Facts and circumstances analysis.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Whether output sold under a contract is allocated to a particular facility (for example, a generating unit), to the
entire system of the seller of that output (net of any uses of that system output allocated to a particular facility),
or to a portion of a facility is based on all the facts and circumstances, including whether the transaction is inconsistent
with the purpose of section 141. In general, output is allocated to a facility or system only to the extent that it is
physically possible. For example, output from a generating unit that is fed directly into a lower voltage distribution
system of the owner of that unit generally cannot leave that distribution system and, therefore, must be allocated
to those receiving electricity through that distribution system. Output may be allocated without regard to physical
limitations, however, if exchange agreements, or similar agreements, provide output to a purchaser where, but for
the exchange agreements, it would not be possible for the seller to provide output to that purchaser.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Factors. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Except as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, contractual terms relating to the delivery of the output (such
as delivery limitations and options or obligations to deliver power from additional sources) are the most significant
factor in allocating output to a facility or system. For example, a contract to provide a specified amount of electricity
from a system, but only when at least that amount of electricity is being generated by a particular unit, generally
is allocated to that unit. Similarly, a contract to buy 20 Mw of system power with a right to take up to 40 percent of the
actual output of a specific 50 Mw facility whenever total system output is insufficient to meet all of the seller's
obligations generally is allocated to the specific facility rather than the system. The method of pricing output
under the contract and the consistency of the contract with commercially reasonable terms are also significant factors.
For example, output sold under a contract to provide peaking capacity from a combustion turbine generally is allocated
to that turbine if the contract provides for pricing that is typical of peaking unit pricing, this pricing is based
on the capital and generating costs of that turbine, or no power need be delivered if that turbine is inoperable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Allocations among users. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A facility or system (or portion thereof) that, under this paragraph (d), is allocable to two or more users generally
is allocated among those users on a ratable basis. Payments for output provided by an output facility financed with
two or more issues of bonds generally are allocated ratably among the issues according to the relative amounts of proceeds
of each issue used to finance that facility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Electric transmission facilities. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a contract for use of a transmission facility provides for payments for transmission services using a more accurate
method of measuring the transmission facilities used than the contract path specified by the parties (for example,
a method that accounts for loop flow or a method based on load share ratios of a network), that method must be used to determine
use under this paragraph. In other cases, the determination of use of an electric transmission facility may be based
on the contract path specified by the parties to the contract, if reasonable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Conservation facilities. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, the financing of an output conservation improvement is treated as the acquisition of an output facility
by the utility sponsoring the improvement. The use of a conservation improvement is allocated under the rules in this
paragraph (d). Thus, generally, the output attributable to a conservation improvement is allocable to the beneficiary
of that output.

Example 1. Joint ownership.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Z, a privately owned electric utility, and City H agree to construct an electric generating facility of a size sufficient
to take advantage of the economies of scale. H will issue $50 million of its 25-year bonds and Z will use $100 million
of its funds for construction of a facility they will jointly own as tenants in common. Each of the participants will
share in the ownership, output, and operating expenses of the facility in proportion to its contribution to the cost
of the facility, that is, one-third by H and two-thirds by Z. H's bonds will be secured by H's ownership in the facility
and by revenues to be derived from its share of the annual output of the facility. Because H will need only 50 percent
of its share of the annual output of the facility during the first 20 years of operations, it agrees to sell Z 10 percent
of its share of that annual output for a period of 20 years pursuant to a contract under which Z agrees to take that power
if available. The facility will begin operation and Z will begin to receive power 4 years after the H bonds are issued
and, therefore, the contract term of the issue will be 21 years. H also agrees to sell the remaining excess portion of
its share of the annual output (40 percent) to numerous other private utilities under a prevailing rate schedule,
including demand charges. No contracts will be executed obligating any person other than Z to purchase any specified
amount of the power for any specified period of time and no person (other than Z) will pay a demand charge or other minimum
payment under conditions which, under paragraph (a) of this section, result in a transfer of substantial benefits
of ownership and substantial burdens of paying the debt service on bonds used directly or indirectly to provide those
facilities. The bonds are not private activity bonds because H's one-third interest in the facility (financed with
proceeds) is treated as a discrete portion of a mixed use facility and, although 10 percent of H's interest in the annual
output of the facility will be used, directly or indirectly, in the trade or business of Z, a non-governmental person,
under the rule in paragraph (a) of this section, that portion constitutes not more than 10 percent of the available
output of the facility. If more than 10 percent of the available output of the facility were to be sold to Z pursuant to
a take or pay contract and more than 10 percent of the debt service on the bonds were to be paid or secured by Z, the bonds
would be private activity bonds under paragraph (a) of this section.

Example 2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Power Authority K, a political subdivision created by the legislature in State X to own and operate certain power generating
facilities, sells all of the power from its existing facilities to four private utility systems under contracts executed
in 1990, under which the four systems are required to take or pay for specified portions of the total power output until
the year 2020. Currently, existing facilities supply all of the present needs of the four utility systems but their
future power requirements are expected to increase substantially. K issues 20-year bonds to construct a large generating
facility. A fifth private utility system contracts with K to take or pay for 15 percent of the available output of the
new facility. The balance of the output of the new facility will be available for sale as required, but initially it
is not anticipated there will be any need for that power. The revenues from the contract with the fifth private utility
system will be sufficient to pay less than 10 percent of the debt service on the bonds (determined on a percent value
basis). The balance, which will exceed 10 percent of the debt service on the bonds, will be paid from revenues from the
contracts with the four systems from sale of power produced by the old facilities. The bonds meet the private business
use test because more than 10 percent of the proceeds will be used in the trade or business of a nongovernmental person.
In addition, the bonds meet the private payment or security test because payment of more than 10 percent of the debt
service, pursuant to an underlying arrangement, will be derived from payments in respect of property used for a private
business use. Therefore, the bonds are private activity bonds.

Example 3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Municipal utility U, a political subdivision, purchases all of the electricity required to meet the needs of its customers
(1,000 Mw) from B, an investor-owned utility that operates its own electric generating facilities, under a 50-year
take or pay contract. Although U does not anticipate that it will require additional electric resources and any new
resources would produce electricity at a higher cost to U than its cost under its contract with B, B encourages U to construct
new resources sufficient to meet the requirements of U's customers. U issues obligations to construct facilities
that will produce 1,000 Mw of electricity. B, U, and I, another investor-owned utility, enter into an agreement under
which U assigns to I its rights under U's take or pay contract with B. Under this arrangement, I will make payments to
U and U will continue to make payments to B for the 1,000 Mw it is entitled to under the original take or pay contract. The
payments made by I to U will be equal to or greater than the amounts required to pay the debt service on U's bonds. Under
paragraph (d) of this section, U's obligations are financing a facility in a manner that is inconsistent with the purposes
of section 141 and, therefore, the take or pay contract under which I purchases electricity is allocable to U's new
facilities. Because I is a nongovernmental person, U's bonds are private activity bonds.

Example 4. Transmission network. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to an order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
FERC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
), municipal utility V and investor-owned utility W enter into an agreement for the shared use of W's transmission
facilities and transmission facilities that V is to construct (collectively, the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
network
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
). Both V and W require shared use of the entire network, rather than point-to-point service. Pursuant to the agreement,
V issues its bonds to construct new transmission facilities. The FERC order provides for sharing of costs of the network
using relative load share ratios. Under this methodology, V will be responsible for 40 percent of the load share of
the network. Under all the facts and circumstances, relative load share ratios is a reasonable method of measuring
the capacity and use of the network. V and W reasonably expect that, on an annual basis, more than 90 percent of the amounts
owed to V for use of its facilities will be paid for in kind (that is, through the provision of transmission services
on W's facilities). The agreement provides that V and W will be entitled to transmission services that are comparable
to the owner's own use. V reasonably expects that, due to the isolated location of the network, no other parties will
seek to use V's transmission facilities. Under these circumstances, W will use more than 10 percent of the available
output of the facilities financed with V's bonds and more than 10 percent of the debt service on V's bonds will be paid
by W. Under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, however, W's use of the financed facilities will not be treated as private
business use if those facilities are financed based on V's reasonable expectations regarding the amount of wheeling
anticipated and the requirements of paragraph (b)(4)(i) and (iii) are satisfied. Although W's use of the financed
facilities involves more than 20 percent of the property financed with the proceeds of the issue, because substantially
all of the consideration for this use is the provision of other transmission services, the limitation in paragraph
(b)(4)(iii) of this section does not apply. Assuming that the financed facilities are not necessitated by the need
to provide transmission to W and that the other conditions of paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section are satisfied, W's
use of the financed facilities will not cause V's bonds to be private activity bonds.

General rule. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 141(b)(4) provides a special private activity bond limitation (the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
$15 million output limitation
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) for issues 5 percent or more of the proceeds of which are to be used to finance output facilities. Under this rule, a
bond is a private activity bond under the private business tests of section 141(b) (1) and (2) if the nonqualified amount
with respect to output facilities financed by the proceeds of the issue exceeds $15 million. The $15 million output
limitation applies in addition to the private business tests of section 141(b) (1) and (2). In addition, under section
141(b)(4) and paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the $15 million limitation is reduced in certain cases. Specifically,
under the $15 million output limitation, the private business use test and the private security or payment test apply
as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Private business use test
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. An issue to which the $15 million limitation applies meets the private business use test if more than $15 million of
the sale proceeds of the issue to be used with respect to an output facility are to be used for a private business use.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Private security or payment test
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. An issue to which the $15 million limitation applies meets the private security or payment test if the payment of the
principal of, or the interest on, more than $15 million of the sale proceeds of the portion of the issue used with respect
to an output facility is (under the terms of the issue or any underlying arrangement) directly or indirectly_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Secured by any interest in an output facility used or to be used for a private business use (or payments in respect

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General rule. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In determining whether an issue more than 5 percent of the proceeds of which are to be used with respect to an output facility
consists of private activity bonds under the $15 million output limitation, the $15 million limitation on private
business use and the $15 million limitation on the private security or payment test are each applied by taking into
account any outstanding issues of tax-exempt bonds with respect to that output facility or any other output facility
that is part of the same project. Thus, the $15 million limitation on private business use for an issue is reduced by
the amount of private business use for that same project financed by any other outstanding tax-exempt bonds. Similarly,
the $15 million limitation on the private security or payment test is reduced by the amount of private security or payments
for that same project for any other outstanding tax-exempt bonds.

In general.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In applying the $15 million output limitation, the benefits and burdens test of &sect;1.141&hyph;7 applies, except
that ``$15 million'' is substituted for ``10 percent''. For this purpose, the amount of private business use with
respect to an output facility financed by an issue is determined by multiplying the percentage of private business
use over the contract term of the issue by the issue price of the issue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Earlier issues for the project. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If an earlier issue is outstanding that must be taken into account under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the amount
of private business use and private security or payments for that issue (as determined under paragraph (a)(3)(i)
of this section) is multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the greater of the outstanding principal amount
or present value of the outstanding bonds of the earlier issue as of the issue date of the later issue, and the denominator
of which is the issue price of the earlier issue as of the issue date of that issue.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
project
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 has the meaning provided in this paragraph. Facilities having different purposes or serving different customer
bases are not ordinarily part of the same project. For example, the following are generally not part of the same project:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) generation and transmission facilities;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) separate facilities designed to serve wholesale customers and retail customers; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) a peaking unit and a baseload unit.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Separate ownership.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Facilities that are not owned by the same person are not part of the same project. All participants in a joint powers
authority that issues bonds to finance a project are treated as related parties for purposes of applying the $15 million
limitation to bonds financing the same project. In the case of undivided ownership interests in a single output facility,
property that is not owned by the same person is treated as separate projects only if the separate interests are not
financed_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Special rule for generating units.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Separate generating units (and related facilities) are not a part of the same project if one is placed in service (determined
under &sect;1.150&hyph;2(c)) more than 3 years before the other. Common facilities or property that will be functionally
related to more than one generating unit must be allocated on a reasonable basis. If a generating unit already is constructed
or is under construction (the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
first unit
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and bonds are to be issued to finance an additional generating unit (the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
second unit
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), all costs for any common facilities paid or incurred before the earlier of the issue date of bonds to finance the second
unit or the commencement of construction of the second unit are allocated to the first unit. At the time that bonds are
issued to finance the second unit (or, if earlier, upon commencement of construction of that unit), any remaining
costs of the common facilities may be allocated among the first and second units so that in the aggregate the allocation
is reasonable.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
project
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means functionally related or contiguous property used for transmission of output but only to the extent that the
property is placed in service during a single 2-year period. Separate property is not part of a single project, however,
unless it is intended to provide transmission between two significant output facilities (for example, a line to connect
two substations).

initial project
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) is not part of the same project as the initial project if the construction, reconstruction, or acquisition of that
improvement commences more than three years after the initial project is placed in service and the bonds issued to
finance that improvement are issued more than three years after the initial project is placed in service.

(i) The need to replace the property was unexpected or occurred more than 3 years in advance of the expected need to replace
the property; and

Example 1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Power authority K, a political subdivision, intends to issue a single issue of tax-exempt bonds to finance the construction
of an electric generating facility under a turnkey construction contract providing for a single payment of $500 million
at the completion of construction. No portion of the facility will be used for a private business use except that L,
an investor-owned utility, will purchase 10 percent of the output of the facility under a take contract and will pay
10 percent of the debt service on the bonds. The maximum amount of tax-exempt bonds that may be issued for the acquisition
of the facility is $465 million (that is, $450 million for the 90 percent of the facility that is governmentally owned
and used, and a maximum of $15 million for the privately used portion).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

The facts are the same as in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 1 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
except that the construction contract calls for milestone payments every 6 months beginning July 1, 1995. K intends
to finance the facility with 4 separate issues of tax-exempt bonds. On July 1, 1995, K issues the first issue for $100
million and makes the first milestone payment. On January 1, 1996, K intends to issue the second issue for the facility
for $150 million and use the proceeds of that issue to make the second milestone payment. As of January 1, 1996, no other
amounts have been paid under the construction contract for the facility and none of the bonds issued on July 1, 1995,
have been retired. The January 1, 1996, issue will consist of private activity bonds since the issue will have $15 million
of private business use and private payments or security (10 percent of $150 million) and the maximum permitted private
use portion for the second issue is only $5 million ($15 million less than $10 million private use portion of the first
issue). For each subsequent issue for the facility and assuming that the January 1, 1996, issue consisted of tax-exempt
bonds, K could not issue tax-exempt bonds to finance the portion of the facility used by L.

Description of test.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under section 141(b)(3) (the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
unrelated or disproportionate use test
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), an issue meets the private business tests if the amount of private business use and private security or payments
attributable to unrelated or disproportionate private business use exceeds 5 percent of the proceeds of the issue.
For this purpose, the private business use test is applied by taking into account only use that is not related to any
government use of proceeds of the issue (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
unrelated use
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and use that is related but disproportionate to any government use of those proceeds (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
disproportionate use
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The private security or payment test is applied by taking into account the payments of the principal of, or the interest
on, the proceeds of the issue that are (under the terms of the issue or any underlying arrangement) directly or indirectly_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Secured by any interest in (A) property used or to be used for a private business use that is either unrelated use
or disproportionate use, or (B) payments in respect of this property; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) To be derived from payments (whether or not to the issuer) in respect of property, or borrowed money, used or to
be used for a private business use that is either unrelated use or disproportionate use.

Order of application.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The unrelated and disproportionate use test is applied by first determining whether a private business use is related
to a government use. Next, private business use that relates to a goverment use is examined to determine whether it
is disproportionate to that govenment use.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Aggregation of unrelated and disproportionate use. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All unrelated use and disproportionate use financed with the proceeds of an issue are aggregated to determine compliance
with the unrelated or disproportionate use test. The amount of permissible unrelated and disproportionate private
business use is not reduced by the amount of private business use financed with the proceeds of an issue that is neither
unrelated use nor disproportionate use.

In general. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Whether a private business use is related to a government use financed with the proceeds of an issue is determined on
a case-by-case basis, emphasizing the operational relationship between the government uses and the private business
uses. In general, a facility that is used for a related private business use must be located within, or adjacent to,
the governmentally used facility.

Parallel related and unrelated uses. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Use of a facility by a nongovernmental person for the same purpose as use by a governmental person is not treated as unrelated
use if the government use is not insignificant. Similarly, a use of a facility in the same manner both for private business
use that is related use and private business use that is unrelated use does not result in unrelated use if the related
use is not insignificant. For example, a privately owned pharmacy in a governmentally owned hospital does not ordinarily
result in unrelated use solely because the pharmacy also serves individuals not using the hospital. In addition,
use of parking spaces in a garage by a nongovernmental person is not treated as unrelated use if more than an insignificant
portion of the parking spaces are used for a government use (or a private business use that is related to a government
use), even though the use by the nongovernmental person is not directly related to that other use.

Definition of disproportionate use. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A private business use is disproportionate to a related government use only to the extent that the amount of proceeds
used for that private business use exceeds the amount of proceeds used for the related government use. For example,
a private use of $100 of proceeds that is related to a government use of $70 of proceeds results in $30 of disproportionate
use.

If two or more private business uses of the proceeds of an issue relate to a single government use of those proceeds,
those private business uses are aggregated to apply the disproportionate use test.

Allocation rule. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a private business use relates to more than a single use of the proceeds of the issue (for example, two or more government
uses of the proceeds of the issue or a government use and a private use), the amount of any disproportionate use may be
determined by:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) reasonably allocating the proceeds used for the private business use among the related uses,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) aggregating government uses that are directly related to each other, or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) allocating the private business use to the government use to which it is primarily related.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Maximum use taken into account. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The determination of the amount of unrelated use or disproportionate use of a facility is based on the maximum amount
of reasonably expected government use of a facility during the term of the issue. Thus, no unrelated use or disproportionate
use arises solely because a facility initially has excess capacity that is to be used by a nongovernmental person if
the facility will be completely used by the issuer during the term of the issue for more than an insignificant period.

Example 1. School and remote cafeteria. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
County X issues bonds with proceeds of $20 million and uses $18.1 million of the proceeds for construction of a new school
building and $1.9 million of the proceeds for construction of a privately operated cafeteria in its administrative
office building, which is located at a remote site. The bonds are secured, in part, by the cafeteria. The $1.9 million
of proceeds is unrelated to the government use (that is, school construction) financed with the bonds and exceeds
5 percent of $20 million. Thus, the issue meets the private business tests.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 2. Public safety building and courthouse. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
City Y issues bonds with proceeds of $50 million for construction of a new public safety building ($32 million) and
for improvements to an existing courthouse ($15 million). Y uses $3 million of the bond proceeds for renovations to
an existing privately operated cafeteria located in the courthouse. The bonds are secured, in part, by the cafeteria.
Y's use of the $3 million for the privately operated cafeteria does not meet the unrelated or disproportionate use
test since these expenditures are neither unrelated use nor disproportionate use.

Example 3. Unrelated garage. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
City Y issues bonds with proceeds of $50 million for construction of a new public safety building ($30.5 million) and
for improvements to an existing courthouse ($15 million). Y uses $3 million of the bond proceeds for renovations to
an existing privately operated cafeteria located in the courthouse. The bonds are secured, in part, by the cafeteria.
Y also uses $1.5 million of the proceeds to construct a privately operated parking garage adjacent to a private office
building. The private business use of the parking garage is unrelated to any government use of proceeds of the issue.
Since the proceeds used for unrelated uses and disproportionate uses do not exceed 5 percent of the proceeds, the unrelated
or disproportionate use test is not met.

Example 4. Disproportionate use of garage. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
County Z issues bonds with proceeds of $20 million for construction of a hospital with no private business use ($17
million); renovation of an office building with no private business use ($1 million); and construction of a garage
that is entirely used for a private business use ($2 million). The use of the garage is related to the use of the office
building but not to the use of the hospital. The private business use of the garage results in $1 million of disproportionate
use because the proceeds used for the garage ($2 million) exceed the proceeds used for the related government use ($1
million). The bonds are not private activity bonds, however, because the disproportionate use does not exceed 5 percent
of the proceeds of the issue.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 5. Bonds for multiple projects. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) County X issues bonds with proceeds of $80 million for the following purposes: (1) $72 million to construct a County
owned and operated waste incinerator; (2) $1 million for a County owned and operated facility for the temporary storage
of hazardous waste prior to final disposal; (3) $1 million to construct a privately owned recycling facility; and
(4) $6 million to build a garage adjacent to the County owned incinerator that will be leased to Company Y to store and
repair trucks that it owns and uses to haul County X refuse. Company Y uses 75 percent of its trucks to haul materials
to the incinerator and the remaining 25 percent of its trucks to haul materials to the temporary storage facility.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The $1 million of proceeds used for the recycling facility is used for an unrelated use. The garage is related use.
In addition, 75 percent of the use of the $6 million of proceeds used for the garage is allocable to the government use
of proceeds at the incinerator. The remaining 25 percent of the garage ($1.5 million) relates to the government use
of proceeds at the temporary storage facility. Thus, this portion of the proceeds used for the garage exceeds the proceeds
used for the temporary storage facility by $.5 million and this excess is disproportionate use (but not unrelated
use). Thus, the aggregate amount of unrelated use and disproportionate use financed with the proceeds of the issue
is $1.5 million. Alternatively, under paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section, the entire garage may be treated as
related to the government use of the incinerator and, under that allocation, the garage is not disproportionate use.
In either event, section 141(b)(3) limits the aggregate unrelated use and disproportionate use to $4 million. Therefore,
the bonds are not private activity bonds under this section.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Nonqualified use
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

reasonable estimates of the cost of facilities (or other property) to be provided by the issue and the failure to expend
the net proceeds on qualifying costs was due to circumstances that were not reasonably foreseeable as of the issue
date.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Remedial action.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An action that causes the private business tests or the private loan financing test to be met is not treated as a deliberate
action if the issuer takes a remedial action described in paragraph (b), (c), (d), or (e) of this section with respect
to the nonqualified bonds and all of the following requirements are met:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Required covenants
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The issuer covenants on the issue date in the bond documents for the issue that it will take no action that would cause
the bonds to be private activity bonds and that it will not fail to take any action that would prevent the bonds from being
private activity bonds, and the issuer established reasonable procedures to ensure compliance with this covenant.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fair market value consideration
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The terms of any agreements that result in satisfaction of either the private business tests or the private loan financing
test are bona fide and arm's-length, and the new user pays consideration equal to the fair market value for the use of
the financed property.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Expectations must be certified
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. An officer of the issuer responsible for issuing the bonds, in good faith, certifies as part of the bond documents
the issuer's expectations as of the issue date, including the facts and estimates that form the basis for the issuer's
expectations regarding the use of proceeds of the issue. The certification is evidence of the issuer's expectations,
but does not establish any conclusions or presumptions of law or fact. A certification under this paragraph (a)(3)
is not required if the issue price of the issue does not exceed $1,000,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Transfer for cash
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If the financed facility is transferred exclusively for cash (a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
transfer for cash
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the requirements of this paragraph (b) are satisfied if an amount equal to the disposition proceeds are used to redeem
a pro rata portion of the nonqualified bonds at the earliest call date after the deliberate action. If the bonds are
not redeemed within 90 days of the date of the transfer, the disposition proceeds must be used to establish a defeasance
escrow for those bonds within 90 days of that date.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Other deliberate actions
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If the deliberate action does not exclusively involve a transfer for cash, funds other than proceeds of a tax-exempt
bond must be used to redeem all the nonqualified bonds. If the bonds are not redeemed within 90 days of the date of the
deliberate act, a defeasance escrow must be established for those bonds within 90 days of that date.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice of defeasance
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Special limitation
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The establishment of a defeasance escrow does not satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (b) if_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The terms of the nonqualified bonds do not provide for a redemption of those bonds within 6 months of the date of the
deliberate action; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) As of the issue date of the nonqualified bonds, there was more than a remote possibility that the financed property
would be transferred to a nongovernmental person during the period beginning on the issue date and ending on the date
the bonds can first be redeemed by the issuer. For this purpose, the possibility of transfer to a nongovernmental person
is treated as remote if the facility is of a type that is not customarily owned and operated by nongovernmental persons.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Defeasance escrow defined
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A defeasance escrow is an irrevocable escrow established to redeem bonds at their earliest call date in an amount
that, together with investment earnings, is sufficient to pay all the principal of the interest and call premium on
the related bonds from the date the escrow is established to the earliest call date. If the amount of the nonqualified
bonds is limited to the amount of the disposition proceeds, the amount required to be deposited in the defeasance escrow
is limited to that amount. The escrow may not be invested in higher yielding investments or in any investment under
which the obligor is a user of the proceeds of the related bonds.

Definition of nonqualified bonds.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The nonqualified bonds are the outstanding bonds allocable to the proceeds with respect to which the deliberate action
was taken. The nonqualified bonds must be in an amount such that, if redeemed with sale proceeds of the issue, the proceeds
of the remaining bonds of the issue are used in a manner that does not cause the bonds to be private activity bonds. Allocations
to nonqualified bonds must be made in accordance with &sect;1.141&hyph;6, except that allocations (i) must be made
on a pro rata basis (adjusted to reflect allocations permitted under &sect;1.141&hyph;6); and (ii) may be made without
regard to whether property qualifies as a discrete portion of a mixed use facility.

bonds have a weighted average maturity that does not exceed 120 percent of the weighted average economic life of the
building. On the issue date, C reasonably expects with a high degree of certainty that it will be the only user of the
building for the entire term of the bonds. Six years after the issue date, C sells the building to Corporation P for $5
million. The sale price is the fair market value of the building, as verified by an independent appraiser. C uses all
of the disposition proceeds to immediately retire a pro rata portion of the bonds. The bonds are not private activity
bonds because of the sale because P is not a user of process (that is, the disposition proceeds were used to redeem the
bonds). See &sect;1.141&hyph;1(c).

, except that instead of selling the building, C, six years after the issue date, leases the building to P for 7 years
and uses other funds to redeem all of the bonds within 90 days of the deliberate act. The bonds are not treated as private
activity bonds because C has taken remedial action described in paragraph (b) of this section.

, except that the fair market value of the building at the time of the sale to P is $6 million. Under these facts and &sect;1.141&hyph;1(c),
the proceeds of the bonds remain allocated to the office building. Therefore, the proceeds of the bonds are used by
P. In addition, because the transfer was for less than fair market value, the bonds are ineligible for the remedial
actions under this section.

Example 4. Redemption of bonds.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 In 1995, City D issues bonds with proceeds of $10 million to finance a courthouse. The bonds have a weighted average
maturity that does not exceed 120 percent of the weighted average economic life of the courthouse. D uses $1 million
of the proceeds for a private business use and more than 10 percent of the debt service on the issue is secured by private
security or payments. D later sells one-half of the courthouse property to a nongovernmental person for cash. D immediately
redeems 50 percent of the outstanding bonds. For purposes of subsequently applying section 141 to the issue, D may
continue to use all of the proceeds of the outstanding bonds in the same manner (that is, for both the courthouse and
the existing private business use) without causing the issue to meet the private business tests. The result would
be the same if D, instead of redeeming the bonds, established a defeasance escrow for those bonds, provided that the
requirement of paragraph (b)(4) of this section was met as of the issue date.

In general.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Whether a refunding issue satisfies the private business tests or the private loan financing tests is determined
exclusively on the use of the proceeds of the refunding issue and the private security or payments with respect to that
issue (that is, without regard to whether the prior issue satisfied those tests).

Private business use and private loan financing tests.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In applying section 141 to a refunding issue, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (a)(2), the proceeds
of the refunding issue are treated as used for the same purposes as the proceeds of the prior issue except that the use
of the property financed with the proceeds of the prior issue before the issue date of the refunding issue is not taken
into account.

(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Special rule.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If, as of the issue date of the refunding issue, the weighted average maturity of the refunding issue is greater than
120 percent of the remaining average economic life of the property financed with the proceeds of the prior issue, the
proceeds of the refunding issue are treated as being used for the same purposes as the proceeds of the prior issue and
use of the property financed with the proceeds of the prior issue before the issue date of the refunding issue is taken
into account.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In applying the private business use test and the private security or payment test (including under &sect;1.141&hyph;7)
to a refunding issue, the issuer may treat the entire refunding issue as a continuation of the prior issue. For this
purpose, under the private security or payment test (including under &sect;1.141&hyph;7), the issuer may use the
yield on the refunded issue to present value payments and security from arrangements that were not entered into in
contemplation of the refunding issue.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Generally, whether bonds issued as part of a refunding issue are qualified bonds (other than bonds issued under sections
144(a) or 1394) is determined exclusively on the basis of the use of the proceeds of the refunding issue, determined
in the same manner as under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. In addition, section 147(d) is applied as of the issue
date of the prior issue. A refunding issue meets the requirements of section 147(b) if the refunded issue met these
requirements and the weighted average maturity of the refunding bonds is not greater than the remaining weighted
average maturity of the refunded bonds. See also &sect;1.103&hyph;8.

 If, as of the issue date of the refunding bonds, the property that was financed by the proceeds of the refunded bond is
not used (or is not reasonably expected to continue to be used), and the refunded bond was a qualified bond under sections
142, 144(a), 144(c), or 1394, the refunding bond is a qualified bond only if_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The refunding issue does not have a weighted average maturity that exceeds the remaining weighted average maturity
of the refunded bonds; and

If an issuer enters into a transaction or series of transactions with respect to one or more issues with a principal
purpose of transferring to nongovernmental persons (other than as members of the general public) significant benefits
of tax-exempt financing in a manner that is inconsistent with the purposes of section 141, the Commissioner may take
any action to reflect the substance of the transaction or series of transactions, including_

Example 1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
City D enters into a development agreement with Corporation T to induce T to locate its headquarters within the D city
limits. Pursuant to the development agreement, in 1995 D will issue $20 million of its general obligation bonds (the
1995 bonds) to purchase land that it will grant to T. The development agreement also provides that, in 1996, D will issue
$20 million of its tax increment bonds (the 1996 bonds), secured solely by the increase in property taxes in a special
taxing district made under the improvements resulting from the development agreement. Substantially all of the
property within the special taxing district is owned by T or D. T will separately enter into an agreement to guarantee
the payment of tax increment to D in an amount sufficient to retire the 1996 bonds. The proceeds of the 1996 bonds will
be used to finance governmentally owned and operated improvements within the special taxing district that will not
give rise to private business use. Treated separately, the 1995 issue meets the private business use test, but not
the private security or payment test; the 1996 issue meets the private security or payment test, but not the private
business use test. Because the two issues are a part of a plan to provide the benefits of tax-exempt financing to T for
its headquarters, however, the 1995 issue and the 1996 issue may be treated by the Commissioner as a single issue for
purposes of applying the private activity bond tests. Accordingly, the bonds of both the 1995 issue and the 1996 issue
may be treated as private activity bonds.

Example 2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
City E acquires an electric generating facility with a useful economic life of more than 35 years and enters into a 25-year
take or pay contract to sell 30 percent of the available output to investor-owned utility M. E plans to use the remaining
70 percent of available output for its own governmental purposes. To finance the entire cost of the facility, E issues
$30 million of its series A taxable bonds at taxable interest rates and $70 million series B bonds, which purport to
be tax-exempt bonds, at tax-exempt interest rates. E allocates all of M's private business use to the proceeds of the
series A bonds and all of its own government use to the proceeds of the series B bonds. The series A bonds have a weighted
average maturity of 15 years, while the series B bonds have a weighted average maturity of 26 years. M's payments under
the take or pay contract are equal to 30 percent of M's total costs (that is, the sum of the debt service required to be
paid on both the series A and the series B bonds and all other operating costs). The allocation of all of M's private business
use to the series A bonds does not reflect economic substance because the series of transactions transfers to M significant
benefits of the tax-exempt interest rates paid on the series B bonds. Because of this actual transfer of benefits,
M's private business use must be allocated on a pro rata basis to both the series B bonds as well as the series A bonds.
Accordingly, both the series A bonds and the series B bonds are private activity bonds.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 2, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
except that the debt service component of M's payments under the take or pay contract is based exclusively on the amounts
necessary to pay the debt service on the series A bonds. E's allocation of all of M's private business use to the series
A bonds is respected because the series of transactions does not actually transfer benefits of tax-exempt interest
rates to M. Accordingly, the series B bonds are not private activity bonds. The result would be the same if the series
A bonds and the series B bonds had substantially equivalent weighted average maturities and E and M had entered into
a customary contract providing for payments based on a ratable share of total debt service.

 In applying the requirements of section 145(a)(2), &sect;&sect;1.141&hyph;1 through 1.141&hyph;16 apply to determine
whether use of the proceeds of an issue (or private payments or security with respect thereto) by a person (other than

 Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b), an issue is an issue of qualified 501(c)(3) bonds if the issuer
and the 501(c)(3) organization reasonably expect, as of the issue date, that the issue will meet the requirements
applicable to those bonds under section 141(e) and section 145. An issue ceases to be an issue of qualified 501(c)(3)
bonds if the issuer or 501(c)(3) organization takes a deliberate action, subsequent to the issue date, that causes
the bonds to fail to comply with the applicable requirements under section 141(e) and 145 (for example, revocation
of exempt status as a result of private inurement). For this purpose, deliberate actions are defined under &sect;1.141&hyph;2.
In lieu of this paragraph (b), &sect;1.141&hyph;12 applies for purposes of section 145(d)(2)(B) (related to certain

 The issuance of tax-exempt bonds in a transaction (or series of related transactions) that includes taxable bonds,
however, may constitute an abusive arbitrage device under &sect;1.148&hyph;10(a), an abuse under &sect;1.141&hyph;15(a),
or otherwise violate the requirements of sections 103 and 141 through 150, for example, structures involving

150(b) applies is that portion that is the nonqualified bonds, within the meaning of &sect;1.141&hyph;13(g)(1),
except that any common areas (as defined in &sect;1.141&hyph;1) are entirely allocated to the nonqualified bonds.

Scope. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section contains rules relating to section 1394, relating to tax-exempt bonds for enterprise zone facilities
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
enterprise zone facility bonds
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). See sections 1394, 1397B, and 1397C for other rules and definitions.

Continuing compliance_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, compliance with the requirements applicable to enterprise
zone facility bonds apply throughout the term of the bonds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Start-up period. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For a qualified business that is first established in connection with the issuance of enterprise zone facility bonds
(as opposed to a continuing qualified business to which financing is provided), the requirements relating to qualification
as an enterprise zone business and satisfaction of the rules for qualified zone property do not apply prior to the date
that is one year after the later of the issue date of the bonds and the date the financed facility is placed in service
(the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
testing date
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Manner of continuing compliance. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An issue is treated as continuing to comply with the requirements of section 1394 (a) and (b) if_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The issuer and each principal user in good faith attempts to meet these requirements throughout the term of the
bonds; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Any failure to meet these requirements is corrected within a reasonable period after the failure is first discovered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Good faith. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to satisfy the good faith requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the issuer and each principal
user must satisfy the requirements of &sect;1.141&hyph;13(a) (relating to conditions to taking remedial actions).
For this purpose, reasonable procedures to ensure compliance with the requirements of section 1394 (a) and (b) include
a requirement that, at least annually, each principal user submit to the issuer information demonstrating its monitoring
of compliance with these requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reasonable period to correct noncompliance. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Noncompliance that is corrected within one year of discovery satisfies the requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(ii)
of this section if, during the period in which the noncompliance exists, the issuer and the principal user use their
best efforts to correct the noncompliance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Application to employee requirements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For purposes of the requirement of section 1397 (b)(6) and (c)(5) that at least 35 percent of the employees are residents
of the empowerment zone or enterprise community, the issuer and each principal user may rely on an employee certification,
signed under penalty of perjury in connection with the hiring of that employee, regarding the residence of the employee
provided_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The employee is made aware of the geographic boundaries of that zone or community;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The employee is required to notify the employer of a change of residence; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Neither the issuer nor the relevant principal user has actual knowledge to the contrary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Application to gross income requirements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the requirement of section 1397B (b)(2) or (c)(1) continues
to be treated as satisfied for each 5-year period during which, on the average, at least 85 percent of the total gross
income of the enterprise zone business is derived from the active conduct of that business if_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section are satisfied; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The requirement of section 1397B (b)(2) or (c)(1) is satisfied during each of the first 3 years after the testing
date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Limitation on amount of bonds_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Determination of outstanding amount. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Whether an issue satisfies the requirements of section 1394(c) (relating to the $3 million and $20 million aggregate
limitations on the amount of outstanding enterprise zone facility bonds) is determined as of the issue date of that
issue based on the issue price of that issue and the adjusted issue price of outstanding bonds.

Loans-to-lenders programs. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Whether an issue satisfies the requirements of section 1394(c) may be determined without regard to the amount of bonds
allocable to lenders in a loans-to-lenders program. This paragraph (c)(2) applies only if the proceeds of those bonds
are loaned to an enterprise zone business within 42 months of the issue date of the bonds or, to the extent not so used,
are used to redeem bonds of the issue within that 42 month period. A loans-to-lenders program is a program in which the
issuer of enterprise zone facility bonds, in order to provide loans to enterprise zone businesses, lends the proceeds
of the bonds to a bank or similar intermediary which must then relend the proceeds to enterprise zone businesses.

qualified zone property, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Original use requirement. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, for purposes of section 1397C(a)(1)(B), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
original use 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
means the first use to which the property is put within the empowerment zone, whether or not that use corresponds to
the use of that property by the taxpayer. However, for purposes of section 1394, property that has been abandoned for
a period in excess of one year is treated as satisfying the requirement of section 1397C(a)(1)(B), notwithstanding
that the date of abandonment occurred before the date on which the designation of the empowerment zone took effect.
See, however, &sect;1.103&hyph;8(a)(5).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Each loan satisfies the requirements of section 147(b) (determined by treating each separate loan as a separate

(A) The issuer reasonably expects as of the issue date of the bonds that loan repayments from principal users will be
used to make additional loans during the portion of the 10-year period following the issue date of the bonds during
which the enterprise community or empowerment zone designation is in effect; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Repayments of principal on loans (including prepayments) that are received during the period described in paragraph
(f)(2)(i)(A) of this section that are not reasonably expected to be used to make new loans to enterprise zone businesses
and repayments of principal on loans (including prepayments) that are received after that period are used within
6 months of receipt to redeem bonds that are part of the issue.

I. Background on the Colorado Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On December 15, 1980, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Colorado program. General background
information on the Colorado program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the conditions
of approval of the Colorado program can be found in the December 15, 1980,

II. Proposed Amendment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated March 18, 1994, Colorado submitted a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA (administrative
record No. CO&hyph;604). Colorado submitted a proposed MOU in response to a letter dated April 7, 1993 (administrative
record No. CO&hyph;539), that OSM sent to Colorado in accordance with 30 CFR 732.17(c). The provisions of the MOU that
Colorado proposed to revise pertain to the respective responsibilities of DMG and WQCD regarding coal mining activities
as they impact the hydrologic balance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the April 7, 1994, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(59 FR 16578), provided an opportunity for a public hearing or meeting on its substantive adequacy, and invited public
comment on its adequacy (administrative record No. CO&hyph;606). Because no one requested a public hearing or meeting,
none was held. The public comment period closed on May 9, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During its review of the proposed MOU, OSM identified concerns relating to (1) the provisions of item No. 2 of the Enforcement
section of the proposed MOU, which appeared to be contradicted by an August 28, 1990, memorandum of agreement between
WQCD and the Mined Land Reclamation Board (the regulatory board of the Mined Land Reclamation Division that has been
reorganized as DMG) and (2) referenced 2 Code of Colorado Regulations 407.2, Rule 4.05, which does not serve as an adequate
basis for ensuring protection of the hydrologic balance. OSM notified Colorado of the concerns by letter dated June
16, 1994 (administrative record No. CO&hyph;627). Colorado responded in a letter dated June 23, 1994, by submitting
additional explanatory information (administrative record No. CO&hyph;629).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the additional explanatory information for the proposed program amendment submitted by Colorado, OSM
reopened the public comment period in the July 29, 1994, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(59 FR 38575; administrative record No. CO&hyph;637). The public comment period ended on August 15, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During its review of the additional explanatory information for the proposed MOU, OSM identified concerns relating
to (1) enforcement of effluent standards and the division of responsibility between DMG and WQCD, and (2) standards
for effluent limits. OSM notified Colorado of the concerns by letter dated September 16, 1994 (administrative record
No. CO&hyph;646). Colorado responded in a letter dated December 7, 1994, by submitting additional explanatory information
(administrative record No. CO&hyph;651).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Colorado proposes additional explanatory information indicating that, because WQCD has primacy for Colorado's
Discharge Permit System program, DMG will enforce Federal, but not State, water quality discharge standards under
the proposed MOU. Colorado has also provided an opinion by the State's attorney general's office that DMG has authority
to enforce the Federal effluent limitation standards at 40 CFR Part 434. Lastly, Colorado also proposes additional
explanatory information indicating that if WQCD approves fundamentally different factors or variances under an
approved National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program, the State will propose to revise the MOU in a proposed
amendment.

III. Public Comment Procedures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM is reopening the comment period on the proposed Colorado program amendment to provide the public an opportunity
to reconsider the adequacy of the proposed amendment in light of the additional materials submitted. In accordance
with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed amendment satisfies the applicable
program approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If the amendment is deemed adequate, it will become part of the Colorado
program.

IV. Procedural Determinations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Executive Order 12778
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed
State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. National Environmental Policy Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Paperwork Reduction Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.). The State submittal that is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart
Federal regulations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated December 7, 1994 (Administrative Record No. IND&hyph;1416), the Indiana Department of Natural Resources
(IDNR) submitted to OSM a State program amendment package consisting of revisions to the Indiana program rules. The
amendment revises language which was inadvertently repealed and pertains to the procedures for the application
and renewal of blaster certification. The following amendments are being proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This new section is added to provide the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 8.1(a) A certified blaster must obtain renewal of the certification every three (3) years. A request for renewal
of the certification shall be in writing upon a form furnished by the department. The request for renewal must be received
by the department not later than thirty (30) days prior to expiration of the certificate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The renewal will be approved if the certified blaster has worked at least twelve (12) months of the preceding thirty-six
(36) months as a certified blaster and the certified blaster is not in violation of 310 IAC 12&hyph;8&hyph;9.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) When the certification is not renewed for more than one (1) year after expiration, the certification will not be
renewable. An application shall be submitted to the department in the event that the individual desires to again be
certified, and the individual shall be considered as a new applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) A renewal notice will be sent to each registrant not less than two (2) months prior to the expiration date of the certification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) All renewal notices and other communications will be sent to the last address given by the registrant to the department.
A failure of the certified blaster to receive a renewal notice under this subsection does not relieve the certified
blaster of the obligation to obtain a renewal of the certification as required under subsection (a) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections
(a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory
programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM.
Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions
on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).

The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon corresponding Federal regulations for which
an economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the corresponding
Federal regulations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background on the Oklahoma Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On January 19, 1981, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Oklahoma program. General background
information on the Oklahoma program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the conditions
of approval of the Oklahoma program can be found in the January 19, 1981, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (46 FR 4902). Subsequent actions concerning Oklahoma's program and program amendments can be found at 30 CFR 936.15,
936.16, and 936.30.

II. Proposed Amendment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated September 14, 1994, Oklahoma submitted a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA (administrative
record No. OK&hyph;964). Oklahoma submitted the proposed amendment at its own initiative with the intention of revising
the Oklahoma program to be consistent with the corresponding Federal regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Oklahoma proposed to revise the Oklahoma Coal Rules and Regulations at Oklahoma Administrative Code (OAC) 460:20&hyph;35&hyph;3,
eligibility for assistance; OAC 460:20&hyph;35&hyph;6, program services and data requirements; and OAC 460:20&hyph;35&hyph;7,
applicant liability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the September 27, 1994 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 49225), provided an opportunity for a public hearing or meeting on its substantive adequacy, and invited public
comment on its adequacy (administrative record No. OK&hyph;964.03). Because no one requested a public hearing or
meeting, none was held. The public comment period ended on October 27, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During its review of the amendment, OSM identified concerns relating to the provisions of Oklahoma's rules at OAC
460:20&hyph;35&hyph;3(a)(2), percentage of ownership and control of the SOAP applicant; OAC 460:20&hyph;35&hyph;6
(a) and (b), extension of SOAP funding to other program services and requirements for collection of specific kinds
of data; and OAC 460:20&hyph;35&hyph;7, liability periods. OSM notified Oklahoma of the concerns by letter dated
November 22, 1994 (administrative record No. OK&hyph;964.09). Oklahoma responded in a letter dated December 20,
1994, by submitting a revised amendment and additional explanatory information (administrative record No. OK&hyph;964.11).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Oklahoma proposes to revise OAC 460:20&hyph;35&hyph;1, definitions, by adding the requirement that the qualified
laboratory prepare the other services specified at OAC 460:20&hyph;35&hyph;6; OAC 460:20&hyph;35&hyph;3(a)(2),
eligibility for assistance, by requiring that attributable production includes, among other things, production
from operations in which the applicant owns more than a 10 percent interest and other operations of persons who own
more than 10 percent of the applicant's operation; OAC 460:20&hyph;35&hyph;6, program services and data requirements,
by adding the requirement that the program administrator select and pay a qualified laboratory to, in addition to
performing specific services, provide other services for eligible operators who request assistance, and by adding
references to require the collection of specific data and results provided; and OAC 460:20&hyph;35&hyph;7, applicant
liability, by requiring reimbursement for the cost of SOAP services (1) If the applicant's production exceeds the
allowable tonnage amount during the 12-month period immediately following the issuance of the permit for which assistance
is provided, or, (2) if the permit is sold, transferred, or assigned, the transferee's production exceeds the allowable
tonnage amount during the 12-month period immediately following the issuance of the permit.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM is reopening the comment period on the proposed Oklahoma program amendment to provide the public an opportunity
to reconsider the adequacy of the proposed amendment in light of the additional materials submitted. In accordance
with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed amendment satisfies the applicable
program approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If the amendment is deemed adequate, it will become part of the Oklahoma
program.

State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other

Oklahoma proposed to revise the Oklahoma Coal Rules and Regulations at sections 780.25 and 784.16, reclamation plan
for ponds, impoundments, banks, dams, and embankments; section 780.37, road systems; section 784.20, subsidence
control plans; section 784.24, transportation facilities; section 800.40, requirement to release performance
bonds; sections 816.46 and 817.46, hydrologic balance and siltation structures; section 816.116, revegetation
success standards; section 816.121, subsidence control; section 823.12, prime farmland soil removal; section
823.13, prime farmland soil stockpiling; and section 823.14, prime farmland soil replacement. Oklahoma also proposed
to recodify its rules in accordance with the standards set forth by the Oklahoma State Legislature and the Office of
Administrative Code.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the September 27, 1994 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 49223), provided an opportunity for a public hearing or meeting on its substantive adequacy, and invited public
comment on its adequacy (administrative record No. OK&hyph;963.03). Because no one requested a public hearing or
meeting, none was held. The public comment period ended on October 27, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During its review of the amendment, OSM identified concerns relating to the provisions of recodified Oklahoma Administrative
Code (OAC) 460:20&hyph;27&hyph;20(b) and 460:20&hyph;31&hyph;17(b), primary road certification requirements
for road systems and transportation facilities, and Oklahoma's proposed rule recodification. With respect to the
recodification, OSM identified concerns relating to OAC 460:20&hyph;43&hyph;12(f)(8), sedimentation pond storage
volume; OAC 460:20&hyph;43&hyph;47 and 460:20&hyph;43&hyph;48, subsidence control for surface mining activities;
OAC 460:20&hyph;45&hyph;28, protection of underground mining; and various editorial and citation inconsistencies.
OSM notified Oklahoma of the concerns by letter dated November 22, 1994 (administrative record No. OK&hyph;963.08).
Oklahoma responded in a letter dated December 20, 1994, by submitting a revised amendment and additional explanatory
information (administrative record No. OK&hyph;963.10).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the issue letter, Oklahoma proposes to move the as-built requirements regarding primary road certification
for road systems and transportation facilities from the permitting requirements of OAC 460:20&hyph;27&hyph;20(b)
and 460:20&hyph;31&hyph;17(b) to the performance standard requirements of OAC 460:20&hyph;43&hyph;53(1) and
460:20&hyph;45&hyph;53(1); to delete at OAC 460:20&hyph;43&hyph;12(f)(8) the requirement that sediment shall
be removed from a structure when the sediment storage volume is 80 percent filled; to provide additional information
explaining why the provisions at OAC 460:20&hyph;45&hyph;47 and 460:20&hyph;45&hyph;48, regarding subsidence
control for surface mining activities, should be retained in its rules; to delete at OAC 460:20&hyph;45&hyph;28
from its underground mining performance standards a provision regarding the protection of underground mining;
and to propose revisions and provide additional explanatory information for the recodification of its coal mining
rules.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM is reopening the comment period on the proposed Oklahoma program amendment to provide the public an opportunity
to reconsider the adequacy of the proposed amendment in light of the additional materials submitted. In accordance
with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed amendment satisfies the applicable
program approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If the amendment is deemed adequate, it will become part of the Oklahoma
program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).

2. Executive Order 12778
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed
State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).

5. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The State submittal that is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an economic
analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic effect
upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously
promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have
a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart Federal regulations.
