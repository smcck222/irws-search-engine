'FRANK, it flies]' shouted someone at Sir Frank Whittle during the maiden
flight of a British jet. 'Of course it does,' replied Sir Frank, who
patented the first aircraft gas turbine. 'That's what it was bloody well
designed to do, wasn't it?'
Exactly 50 years ago yesterday, the first British jet made a brief 17-minute
flight from RAF Cranwell in Lincolnshire. To celebrate the event, Mr Eric
'Winkle' Brown, a 72-year-old test pilot of the prototype Gloster Whittle
jet, Mr Geoffrey Bone, a 73-year-old engineer, and Mr Charles McClure, a
75-year-old pilot, returned to RAF Cranwell. They are seen in front of a
restored Meteor NF 11. Sir Frank was unable to attend because of ill-health.
The Gloster Whittle was not the first jet to fly: a Heinkel 178 had its
maiden flight in August 1939, 21 months before the British aircraft.

THE PICTURE of a Gloster Whittle jet on Page 7 of the issue of Tuesday May

pre-conditions

Correction (published 16th May 1991) appended to this article.
Geevor, the UK mining group which has been fighting for survival since the
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce called in a Pounds 2.1m loan in
extraordinary circumstances in January, has suffered another set-back.
Its proposed merger with European Mining Finance, a Luxembourg-quoted
investment company, has run into problems and will not go ahead on the terms
announced in March.
Two of the pre-conditions for the merger have not been satisfied - the
raising of bank finance for the enlarged group and the termination of the
management agreement between EMF and its manager, Lion Mining Finance.
However, Geevor said it remained in talks with EMF and other parties 'which
may result in modified proposals'.
Monarch Resources, the UK-quoted mining group with operations in Venezuela,
has appointed Mr Anthony Ciali as president and chief executive officer.
This follows the recent boardroom shake-up which resulted in the departure
of seven directors and the arrival of Mr Michael Beckett as chairman.
Mr Beckett was managing director of Consolidated Gold Fields and Mr Ciali
was once a vice-president of Gold Fields Mining Corp, a US subsidiary.
Correction (published 16th May 1991).
Lion Mining Finance is not the manager of European Mining Finance as we
reported on May 14.

FT  14 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE 2,500 lost in nervous trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FRESH indications of the depth of the UK recession, wavering optimism for
base rate cuts this week and a poor lead from Wall Street all combined to
undermine the UK stock market yesterday.
Pressure for a further reduction in base rates was increased by the news
yesterday that the monthly rise in domestic consumer borrowing was at a
six-year low in March. However, last week's cautionary views on interest
rates from the Bank of England have cast uncertainty over hopes in the City
of London that UK base rates will be cut this Friday in the wake of the
expected fall in the UK retail price index.
Attempts by the equity market to hold on to FT-SE 2,500, reached at the end
of last month, proved fruitless yesterday and the market closed 37.7 points
down at 2,486.6. The final picture was exceedingly gloomy, with the London
market extending its losses to finish virtually at the day's low as Wall
Street continued its overnight fall of 51 Dow points by losing a further
9.39 early in the new session.
Confidence was not helped at the close by sudden rumours that another large
rights issue is in the offing. Institutional coffers are beginning to feel
the weight of a 1991 rights issue burden already approaching Pounds 4bn,
without including a substantial number of share placings.
In the face of Wall Street's heavy setback on Friday night, the London
market opened 23 Footsie points off, quickly abandoning the FT-SE 2,500 mark
attained at the close of business on April 30. There was no significant
recovery during the session but further losses were restrained at first by
the relative absence of sellers and a FT-SE June futures contract which
managed to hold above 2,500 until late in the day. But losses in share
prices were rapidly extended in late trading as the big institutions backed
away from the stock market.
Market volume, as recorded by a Seaq-traded shares total of 354.9m shares,
was low, even by comparison with Friday's 423m figure. The institutions were
believed to be top slicing, selling a small part of their holdings in blue
chip stocks in the expectation that these shares will be bought back more
cheaply in the weeks ahead.
Weakness in oil shares set the trend for widespread losses among Wall
Street-orientated stocks. The industrial blue chips featured falls in BOC,
BAT Industries, Reuters and ICI. However, share losses in the international
sector were mostly suffered early in the session and did not increase
disproportionately after Wall Street opened lower; some analysts commented
that this indicated that domestic factors were the most significant in the
market yesterday.
The uncertain political scene in the UK, ahead of Thursday's by-election in
the Monmouth constituency acted as a further discouragement to the big
institutions, which are increasingly of the view that there will be little
to attract them to the UK stock market until the third quarter of the year.
Trading specialists suggested yesterday that, with their cash holdings
drained by rights issues, the institutions are now less willing to buy cheap
stock whenever the market gives ground. Some believe that fund managers may
wait until the FT-SE falls by a further 50 or more points before making
serious buying forays.
However, optimism for a further strong rise in the UK market over the next
12 months, perhaps to around FT-SE 2,750, remains undimmed.

FT  14 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON derivatives continued to trade under the shadow of Wall Street,
opening weaker following the decline in the US in the previous session and
then slipping still lower as New York extended its slide in London hours
yesterday.
The UK equity futures market began weakly and helped to pull the stock
market down. The premium of the June FT-SE 100 index over the spot index
narrowed from 20 points to around 10 on selling by independent traders.
At one stage, the futures market attempted to rally and succeeded in
widening the gap over the share market to 20 points. But with Wall Street on
the defensive, prices were again marked lower and by the close June was back
to less than a 10-point premium to the spot market.
The June FT-SE closed at 2,494, down 42 points on the day. Its premium
finished at 6 points, against fair value of 15.
In traded options, the stock market's inability to break out of the range of
the past fortnight prompted investors to sell calls against stock holdings.
Elsewhere, there was a buyer of 1,000 Asda July 130 calls; a buyer of 500
GrandMet October 650 puts; and a buyer of 250 Barclays June 460 calls.
The Euro FT-SE was boosted by a seller of 1,000 July 2,625 calls and a buyer
of 1,000 July 2,525 puts.

FT  14 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (America): Bond recovery fails to bring
joy to equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
THE STOCK market remained subdued yesterday in the wake of last Friday's
sell-off, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallying only marginally in
very light trading from the 50-point drop, writes Patrick Harverson in New
York.
At the close the Dow was 4.25 up at 2,924.42, having spent most of the day
in negative territory. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 moved in
similar fashion, recovering 1.02 on balance at 376.76, while the Nasdaq
composite picked up 0.51 to 493.93. Turnover on the New York SE totalled
just 130m shares, while rises showed a small lead over falls at the finish
by 786 to 742.
On Friday it was the sharp fall in bond values which led share prices lower,
but yesterday's modest recovery in the bond market failed to stimulate a
similar movement among stocks. The weakness in the US economy continues to
trouble investors, who can see little reason to invest more of their money
in equities.
Yesterday's industrial production data provided no real comfort on the
economic front. Although the data showed an expected 0.1 per cent increase
in April production, the Federal Reserve also revealed a revised 0.6 per
cent decline in March production, previously estimated at 0.3 per cent.
Banks featured, with American Express dropping Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 22
3/4 on turnover of 4.1m shares after announcing that it would take a Dollars
144m pre-tax charge to account for the 28 per cent stake held by Shearson
Lehman Brothers, its securities subsidiary, in First Capital Holdings, the
troubled Californian life insurance group.
Bankers Trust was down Dollars 1 at Dollars 48 5/8 after the New York-based
banking group confirmed it was laying off 200 staff, while JP Morgan, which
had been actively bought since it was announced over a week ago that the
stock would join the Dow index, slipped Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 50 3/8 on
meeting profit-taking.
Square D jumped Dollars 6 3/8 to Dollars 87 3/8 after the company agreed to
the bid by Schneider, of France, of Dollars 88 a share, or Dollars 2.23bn.
AT&amp;T bucked the trend, firming Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 36 1/2 in active
trading after reports that the merger with NCR is proceeding faster than
expected.
On the over-the-counter market, Nordstrom jumped Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 44
on turnover of 1.5m shares on the back of an improvement of almost 100 per
cent in first-quarter profits. Apple Computer climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to
Dollars 52 3/4 on volume of 2.2m shares after the company introduced its
System 7 operating system software and said it would cut prices on logic
board upgrades and memory kits for the Macintosh.
Metcalf &amp; Eddy fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 15 1/4 after the water
treatment and waste management company issued a second-quarter profits
warning.
Canada
AFTER spending most of the day in lower territory, the Toronto market
managed a mild recovery during the afternoon to end on a mixed note.
The composite index was finally a net 2.9 up at 3,492.7 but declining issues
still held an edge over advances by 273 to 240. Volume amounted to 21.6m
shares, down from Friday's 23.3m.
Lincoln Waste Management topped the most actives list after one of the
company's largest shareholders and one of its directors sold more than 4m
shares, approaching one-fifth of the session's moderate volume. The share
price was steady at CDollars 10 7/8 .
John Labatt, which rose CDollars 1 to CDollars 23 5/8 , said it is
considering selling its JL Foods Inc unit.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar and yen lose ground
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR fell against European currencies but improved in terms of the
Japanese yen yesterday. A rise of 0.1 per cent in April US industrial
production was roughly in line with expectations, while a revised fall of
0.6 per cent from 0.3 per cent in March output brought little reaction in
the US currency.
A decline to 78.3 per cent in April US capacity utilisation, from a downward
revision to 78.5 per cent for March, also had no effect on a market waiting
for today's data on US consumer prices and Friday's trade figures.
At the London close the dollar had fallen to DM1.7140 from DM1.7255; to
FFr5.8050 from FFr5.8400; and to SFr1.4430 from SFr1.4580. On the other hand
it rose to Y139.40 from Y138.75 against a generally weak yen. The dollar's
index dipped to 66.2 from 66.4.
Speculation about an early cut in the Bank of Japan's discount rate
depressed the yen. This helped to boost the D-Mark after rumours subsided
that Mr Karl Otto Pohl was about to resign as president of the German
Bundesbank.
The rumours led to D-Mark nervousness in early trading, but by the end of
the day attention was focused on interest rate factors and this pushed the
German currency up against the yen. It finished in London at Y81.35 compared
with Y80.40 on Friday.
In the European exchange rate mechanism the D-Mark improved against the
weakest placed French franc and also the Italian lira, but lost ground to
sterling.
The Bank of France left its money market intervention rate unchanged at 9
per cent at a securities repurchase tender, keeping interest rate
differentials steady as the Bank of Spain and Belgian National Bank also
left rates unaltered at similar tenders.
The lira weakened against several of its partners in the ERM after Sunday's
one-point cut to 11 1/2 per cent in the Bank of Italy's discount rate.
However, it remained the second strongest ERM currency, according to figures
from the European Commission, in spite of losing ground to the D-Mark,
French franc and other members of the ERM at the Milan fixing.
Sterling was the third strongest ERM currency as speculation continued about
the possible timing of another reduction in UK bank base rates. Mr David
Mellor, chief secretary to the Treasury, said on BBC radio that 'the
chancellor will not cut interest rates until he considers it prudent to do
so'.
The Bank of England has signalled that it does not consider this an
appropriate time, but the market still believes an early cut is possible as
political pressure increases on the government.
Sterling rose 1.30 cents to Dollars 1.7320, while improving to DM2.9675 from
DM2.9650; to Y241.50 from Y238.50; and to FFr10.0550 from FFr10.0400, but it
eased to SFr2.5000 from SFr2.5075. The pound's index put on 0.2 to 91.8.
Sterling gained a further 20 points in New York to end at Dollars 1.7340.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Farmers' Viewpoint - Machinery
rings seem an all-round success story / The time is coming in the UK for a
co-operative idea already working very well on the Continent
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Farmers love government grants. But the flurry of urgent activity in recent
weeks to beat today's deadline for applications for grant aid to help set up
machinery rings has been out of all proportion to their value. There are
much more significant reasons for farmers to co-operate in an effort to cut
the capital costs of machinery. The ending of the modest Pounds 10,000 per
ring grant payable over three years merely concentrated minds.
Machinery rings began in Germany about 25 years ago. Born out of hard times,
they brought together groups of farmers in local areas who were prepared to
work some of their machinery on other people's farms where the appropriate
tackle was worn out or did not exist. In other words, one member of a ring
might provide the combine harvester and deal with the grain on a number of
farms while another would bale the straw and yet another might plough and
plant all the land for the following year's crops.
Rings formalised local arrangements of this kind which had been going on
between farmers in the same village for years and set standard charges for
given tasks. By broadening the area over which such arrangements operated,
it also gave members access to more specialised equipment. By employing a
manager to co-ordinate the work it provided organisation and a guarantee of
payment to those who did the work.
Today, there are about 260 machinery rings in Germany and the idea has
spread to other European countries, especially Holland and France. There
were no rings established in the UK, however, until 1987 after a visit to
Germany by a Scottish agricultural adviser who came home and enthused his
clients over the concept. Since then, 10 machinery rings have been set up in
Scotland.
Although most are still developing and expanding, it is expected that the
total turnover of the Scottish rings this year will reach Pounds 2.5m.
Moreover, the single most successful Scottish group, with 220 members
already, has a turnover in excess of Pounds 1m.
The first English machinery ring was formed in Sussex and Kent only last
year. Since then, 15 more have been established across the country. All have
or are hoping to qualify for the Pounds 10,000 grant, 25 per cent of which
comes from the EC and 75 per cent from the UK government. The scheme is
administered by Food From Britain. At least another two rings are thought to
be in course of formation but they will almost certainly not meet today's
grant deadline.
Within four years, therefore, Britain has gone from no machinery rings to
close to 30 and the majority of them have been set up during the last few
weeks. The ending of the grant had undoubtedly speeded their formation (it
has been available since 1986) but Pounds 3,333 per year for three years
split be-tween perhaps 200-300 farmers is insufficient motivation on its own
for what has happened.
The plain fact is that the machinery ring is an idea whose time has now come
in the UK. To some extent there is an element of following fashion because
the concept has received a great deal of publicity in recent months. The
main reason for the rush of activity, however, is declining farm profits and
the realisation by a growing number of farmers that they must cut their
costs to survive in business.
On average, the so-called 'variable costs' of running a farm - the money
spent on seeds, fertilisers, sprays and so on - amount to between 35 per
cent and 40 per cent of total costs. Fixed costs account for the remaining
60 per cent to 65 per cent and cover such things as labour, interest
charges, power and machinery.
In recent years, as margins have declined, some of these 'fixed costs' have
had to become variable as numbers of farmworkers have diminished either
through natural wastage or redundancy and as assets have been sold to reduce
borrowings and, therefore, interest charges. Power costs are more difficult
to control in the face of fluctuating oil prices while real depreciation on
machinery values can be horrendous.
Indeed, the depreciation rates typically used in farm accounts may well be
insufficient to allow for the replacement of machines whose purchase prices
continue to rise with inflation.
Add to that the fact that many farms are over-mechanised for the
understandable reason that farmers like to feel on top of any job, whatever
the weather, and it is clear that economies in machinery costs are overdue
in the current financial climate.
The machinery ring has obviously been recognised as a possible solution. For
Pounds 50 per year membership charge and a modest purchase of share capital,
a farmer can plug into a source of extra income or extra help, whichever he
prefers. Commission charges of 2 per cent are levied on both the demander
and the provider of the work to cover the costs of the co-ordinator and his
computer. Otherwise, the charges for work are set at similar rates to the
most competitive contractors.
Experience shows, apparently, that most rings lose money in their first year
or two but that as the organisation develops and as members begin to review
their machinery replacement policies, the flow of work offered and done
builds up dramatically. Indeed, it is possible to foresee situations where
some farmers decide to buy bigger machines than they can justify in order to
earn extra cash working on other members' farms. At the same time, other
farmers may see opportunities to earn more money off the farm and be pleased
to pay a ring member to do most of his farm work.
The pattern is already established in Germany, albeit on smaller farms than
are typical in the UK. It is yet another step towards the establishment of
significant numbers of part-time farmers in this country. In any event,
those groups of farmers who have their machinery rings up and running are
convinced that there is a potential for many more.
A couple of weeks ago, there was a meeting of machinery ring leaders at the
National Agricultural Centre at Stoneleigh, in Warwickshire. They decided to
set up an Association of Machinery Rings to guide those who come after and
to lobby on behalf of members on such things as the presently-restricted use
of red, tax-free diesel fuel in tractors travelling more than 15 miles from
their home base. They see this as a possible inhibition to the efficient
working of rings which may cover an area 30 to 40 miles wide.
The success of the concept relies on the willing co-operation of farmers. In
this country, agricultural co-operation, with a few notable exceptions, has
seldom succeeded beyond the first flush of enthusiasm. I believe this
machinery ring version of co-operation will work. In any case, the other day
I signed up to join one.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME monitors copper market as
squeeze tightens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON Metal Exchange executive yesterday said it was carefully
monitoring events in the copper market where a technical squeeze has been
causing severe volatility.
As the squeeze reached its climax yesterday the price of borrowing (buying
cash and selling forward) for one day reached Pounds 40 a tonne.
During recent upheavals in the zinc market, the LME executive persuaded
those with metal to lend to restrict the cost of borrowing for a day to
Dollars 20 a tonne and some dealers asked last night why the cost of
borrowing copper had been allowed to rise much more substantially.
Mr Martin Abbott, the LME's director of marketing, said: 'Our duty is to run
an orderly market - not to limit the cost of borrowing or the back-wardation
(the premium for metal for immediate delivery compared with the three-month
price).'
Copper's backwardation widened to Pounds 100 a tonne at one stage yesterday
and traders said this would continue to stimulate a flood of the metal into
LME warehouse stocks. Copper stocks already stood at 261,775 tonnes at the
weekend, the highest total for seven years, and traders estimated that
today's stock report would show a further increase of about 10,000 tonnes.
Mr Abbott said however, that, although the LME's copper stocks were
relatively high, it would be wrong to assume that all the metal was
available to be sold on the market. The owners might well be 'parking' the
copper briefly in LME warehouses.
The copper market was going through a 'choppy period' of volatility because
there was still a split of opinion about whether there would be a surplus
this year, Mr Abbott suggested. This choppiness could go on for some time
before there was a clear consensus of opinion about the fundamental
direction of the market.
However, many analysts now insist that the recession which is begining to
make its mark on even the strongest economies will far outweigh any
interruptions to copper supplies this year.
In the latest Metals and Mining Monthly Update from Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken,
part of the Banque Indosuez Group, analyst Mr Robin Bhar says key copper
consuming sectors in the US (construction, autos and capital goods) will
remain depressed and consumption in Germany is likely to be restrained by
slowing economic growth caused by the mounting costs of reunification.
Consequently, says Mr Bhar, copper stocks will keep rising during 1991 and
the price is likely to fall decisively below Dollars 1 a lb, perhaps to
between 70 cents and 80 cents a lb. The dollar price ended at Dollars 1.04 a
lb last night.
In sterling terms, cash copper ended at Pounds 1,443 a tonne, down Pounds
6.50 from Friday's close, while three-month metal was Pounds 1,346, down
Pounds 11.50.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Total in Algerian gas field
deal

TOTAL, THE French state-controlled oil group, has signed a FFr3bn (Dollars
512m) agreement with Sonatrach, Algeria's state oil company, for the
development of the Hamra gas field, writes George Graham in Paris.
The French group will provide financing and technological assistance for the
development of the field, expected to start production in 1994.
In return, Total will have access to Hamra's entire output of condensates
and liquefied petroleum gas - an estimated 150m to 200m barrels petroleum
equivalent - for a period of 14 to 17 years.
The deal shows the continued willingness of big Western companies to invest
in Algeria, despite the political uncertainty that has been hanging over the
country's future since the rise of the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation
Front.
Total also agreed yesterday to renew for a further five years its joint
venture with Sonatrach for the operation of the Mereksen oil field, which
currently produces around 600,000 tonnes of oil a year. It also signed two
exploration contracts covering 6,458 square kilometres at Djebel Bottena and
Hamra Southeast.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fuel cell use is predicted for
platinum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FUEL CELLS, environmentally friendly units which produce electricity and
heat from a controlled chemical reaction be-tween hydrogen and oxygen, are
likely to provide the next substantial industrial application for platinum,
according to Johnson Matthey, the world's biggest platinum marketing group.
By the end of this century about 200,000 troy ounces of platinum a year
could be ab-sorbed by this new market - about the same as the chemical and
electrical industries each use today, JM suggests in its annual review of
the market.
However, this could be a conservative estimate. If fuel cells incorporating
platinum catalysts are used and if the market develops as projected by the
Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry, annual demand for
platinum in that country alone by the year 2010 would be more than 400,000
ounces.
'Beyond the turn of the century platinum consumption could soar, should the
market for fuel cells in vehicles materialise and dreams of a hydrogen
economy become a reality,' says Mr Jeremy Coombes, author of the JM review.
The fuel cell is a prime contender to meet demand for electricity without
increasing pollution, he points out. It is versatile and efficient, produces
hardly any noxious emissions and so could help to re-solve the apparent
conflict between continued economic growth and the preservation of a healthy
environment.
Fuel cells went into commercial production for the first time last year.
Japan is showing the most commitment to their development. The Japanese
government is spending about Dollars 27m a year on research, and Fuji
Electric, Toshiba and Sanyo have developed marketable products and
established production lines to build them.
The US Department of Energy is currently spending Dollars 44m a year on fuel
cell research while spending in Europe is about Dollars 60m. By 1995 more
than 100 fuel cells will be installed and producing power in Europe, Japan,
the US and the Far East.
Mr Coombes says commercial units should be available in 1993 at a cost of
Dollars 1,500 per kilowat of generating capacity, not much more than the
cost from conventional generating plant, and the cost is likely to fall as
more fuel cells are built.
On the main features of the platinum market last year, the JM review
reports:
Demand for platinum in-creased by 5.5 per cent to a record 3.66m ounces.
Supplies rose by 9 per cent to 3.73m ounces.
The market moved into marginal oversupply of 70,000 ounces from a marginal
undersupply of 45,000 ounces in 1989. The slight oversupply might continue
for some years.
Supplies from South Africa, the world's biggest producer, were constrained
by production difficulties but grew modestly. Shipments to the west from the
Soviet Union, at 700,000 ounces, were the highest for 15 years.
This year JM expects platinum to trade at about Dollars 400 an ounce before
rising as the year progresses towards Dollars 450.

FT  14 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Citicorp in asset-backed
launch worth Dollars 1.4bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CITICORP yesterday launched its first global asset-backed bond issue since
August last year, a Dollars 1.4bn deal backed by a portfolio of credit card
receivables.
The progress of the deal confirmed that investors are once again willing to
buy asset-backed securities. This will encourage other financial
institutions looking to remove consumer finance assets from their balance
sheets through securitised bond offerings.
The five-year deal, lead-managed by Salomon Brothers, is backed by credit
card receivables in Citicorp's 'master trust' of credit card accounts.
The main portion of the deal, at Dollars 1.25bn, carries a triple-A credit
rating by virtue of an additional Dollars 155m subordinated tranche which
will absorb any initial losses of the master trust.
The deal will be priced today, with the senior notes at an indicated yield
spread of between 95 and 99 basis points over five-year US Treasury paper.
The subordinated bonds, which carry an A-2/A credit rating from US credit
rating agencies Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's, will be priced at around 145
basis points over US Treasuries.
The lead manager said most of the international market tranche of the deal
was placed with institutional investors based in London. However, US
investors remain dominant buyers of mortgage-backed bonds, and most of the
subordinated paper was placed in the US.
Citicorp's last asset-backed deal in the international bond market was
launched in November. The deal was then priced to yield 90 basis points over
US Treasury securities, but the bonds traded out to well over 100 basis
points after launch.
Market sentiment, however, has been firmer over the past two months, and the
deal's pricing was considered attractive. In addition, the deal had been
widely anticipated in the market, and many investors had set aside funds to
buy the bonds. Demand was dominated by institutional investors.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Government Bonds: Gilts follow Treasuries' fall in auction
aftermath
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
UK GOVERNMENT bonds plummeted yesterday morning, responding to the sharp
fall in the US Treasury bond market on Friday afternoon.
The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent Treasury stock due 2003/07 opened at 110 9/32
and fell to a low of 109 1/2 before recovering in the afternoon.
Traders said the disappointing UK credit business figures released
yesterday, which were slightly higher than market expectations, may have
helped to depress prices.
The gilts market is this week waiting for the release of several important
economic indicators which could determine whether the Bank of England
decides to cut the base rate. These include the producer prices index for
April today, the unemployment figures on Thursday, and the retail prices
index on Friday.
THE US government bond market remained unsettled yesterday in the wake of
Friday's frenzied sell-off, but prices at the long end did gain ground on
the back of some sporadic buying.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year Treasury issue was up 1 7/32 at 98
13/32 , to yield 8.264 per cent. The two-year note was up  1/16 at 100 5/16
, yielding 6.808 per cent. Trading activity was exceptionally light.
Dealers and investors continued to digest the implications of the dramatic
fall in prices which followed last week's difficult auction of Dollars 37bn
in government securities. With a large chunk of that paper still to be
distributed, analysts were not expecting any significant recovery in bond
values in the near term.
The day's only economic news had little impact on sentiment. The Federal
Reserve reported that industrial production rose 0.1 per cent in April,
after falling a revised 0.6 per cent in March.
THE Italian government bond market jumped yesterday following the
one-percentage point cut in the discount rate at the weekend.
The cut, from 12.5 to 11.5 per cent, followed the cabinet's approval of
L14,000bn in spending cuts and revenue increases to curb the public deficit.
Yields fell across the range of maturities as retail buyers scrambled to buy
bonds. The yield on the 12.5 per cent bond due 2001 fell from 13.35 per cent
to 13.07 per cent.
The Bank of Italy's decision to cut the reserve requirement on the net
increase in banks' and credit institutions' foreign currency deposits, with
effect from the June reserve month, was seen as a bullish factor by the
market. The move should free around L5,000bn of funds for use by the credit
system.
The cut in the Italian discount rate buoyed hopes of interest rate cuts in
the Spanish and French government bond markets
The Spanish bond market saw strong buying interest among the shorter-dated
maturities. The yield on Spain's 13.45 per cent government bond due April
1996 fell from 11.91 to 11.82 per cent as foreign buyers moved in, hoping to
benefit from an expected cut in the intervention rate.
The Bank of Spain left its key money market rate unchanged at 13.5 per cent
at its repurchase tender for central bank certificates. Traders said that
this was disappointing, but did not rule out the possibility of an interest
rate cut soon.
Other European government bond markets opened weak in the wake of the US
Treasury bond market's fall on Friday.
The German market was haunted yet again by the rumour that Bundesbank
president, Mr Karl Otto Pohl, may step down. Bund prices fell after the US
decline, with the longer maturities taking the brunt of the fall. Despite
some buying interest in short and medium-dated bunds, they ended almost
unchanged on the day.
JAPANESE government bonds rallied as a fall in short-term interest rates
rekindled hopes of a cut in the official discount rate.
The overnight unsecured call rate was cut from 8 3/16 to 8 1/16 per cent,
while the rate on three-month certificates of deposit fell from 7.9 to 7.83
per cent. The fall was interpreted by some traders as a possible sign of the
Bank of Japan easing monetary policy. The yen weakened against the dollar
due to the lower interest rates, and traders said the Bank of Japan
intervened to buy yen and sell dollars yesterday.
The bond rally was short-lived, and JGB prices closed almost unchanged as
attention later in the day focused on a number of Euroyen issues, including
one of Y50bn by the World Bank. The benchmark No 129 JGB opened with a yield
of 6.635 per cent, moving to 6.605 per cent before closing in Tokyo at 6.63.
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the investment banking arm of the Barclays group,
has obtained a seat on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange through its
newly-acquired German investment bank, Merck, Finck, writes David Lascelles,
Banking Editor.
Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken (S-E-Banken) will use the trading name
Scandinvanian Bank for its branch in London. S-E-Banken bought Scandinavian
Banking Group, the London consortium bank, last year and its licence is
being surrendered.

<TEXT>
USF&amp;G, the large but troubled US insurance group, yesterday revealed plans
to bolster its capital base by raising up to Dollars 300m through issues of
convertible preferred stock.
Last month, the Baltimore-based multiline insurer said that it would cut its
workforce by around a quarter in a major 'downsizing' of its business.
It is also in the midst of reorganising its operational structure so that
its commercial and personal lines become two separate businesses with
independent profit centres.
The company announced a Dollars 569m loss last year, and has already cut its
quarterly dividend from 73 cents a share to 5 cents a share.
A new chairman, Mr Norman Blake, was brought into the company in November,
and other management changes have followed.
USF&amp;G said yesterday that the majority of the proceeds of the new issues
would be used 'to strengthen the surplus of the primary unit, United States
Fidelity and Guaranty Company'.
It anticipated that the funds would be raised via the issue of two series of
convertible prefered stock. These would be sold to investors both through a
public offering and through a separate private placement.

<TEXT>
TOYODA Automatic Loom Works, a leading member of the Toyota Motor group,
reported an 11.1 per cent increase in pre-tax profit to Y30.2bn (Dollars
218.84m) for the year to end-March, as sales of automobile assembly
equipment rose with the expansion of vehicle production at Toyota.
The company, the first founded of the Toyota group, reported an 18.8 per
cent increase in sales to Y583.69bn, with a 33.5 per cent surge in textile
machinery sales, a 28.2 per cent rise in automobile assembly equipment, and
an 8.8 per cent improvement in industrial vehicles.
Company officials said personnel expenses rose during the year because of
Japan's labour shortage, and earnings were affected by the increase in the
country's interest rates, but they added that the advance in sales more than
compensated for those costs.
However, Japan's vehicle market has softened and export markets are also
troubled, so sales for this year are expected to rise only 4.5 per cent to
Y610bn, while pre-tax profit is predicted to fall 2.3 per cent to Y29.5bn,
the first fall in five years.
Toyota Tsusho, a trading arm of the Toyota group, reported a 10.8 per cent
lift in sales to Y2,163bn, while pre-tax profit increased 4.5 per cent to
Y16.16bn.
Domestic sales advanced 10.4 per cent, while foreign trade increased 11.6
per cent, with exports up 19 per cent, imports down 0.5 per cent, and trade
between third world countries up 16.4 per cent.
The company expects a 6.2 per cent increase in sales to Y2,300bn this year
and an 11.4 per cent rise in pre-tax profit to Y18bn, despite higher labour
costs and a heavier interest payment burden.
Another Toyota affiliate, Aisin Seiki, is expecting a decline in recurring
profit from the Y20.2bn in the year to end-March, up 1.1 per cent on 1989,
to around Y17bn for the present year.
The company announced yesterday that sales for the year to end-March rose
14.5 per cent to Y525bn, with those of automobile parts up 14.8 per cent to
Y495.7bn and household machinery rising 10.1 per cent to Y29.2bn.
Sales for the current year are expected to increase 4.7 per cent to Y550bn,
but the expected downturn in profits is attributed to the sluggish car
market, and increased depreciation and personnel expenses.

<TEXT>
NORDSTROM, the Seattle-based retailer managed by the founding Nordstrom
family, yesterday turned in sharply higher first-quarter earnings and said
it had settled federal and state securities class action lawsuits for
Dollars 7.5m.
Mr John Goesling, Nordstrom's senior vice-president, said the results
'compare favourably with what we regarded as a disappointing performance
during the previous year's first quarter.'
Net income leapt 95 per cent to Dollars 25.7m, or 31 cents a share, from
Dollars 13.2m, or 16 cents, a year earlier. Net sales grew 10 per cent in
the three months to Dollars 610.6m from Dollars 555m.
Shares in Nordstrom jumped Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 44 yesterday in active
over-the-counter trading. The company attributed its improved performance to
improving sales trends, better management of inventories and steps taken in
the previous year to reduce operating expenses.
During the quarter, Nordstrom reduced its selling, general and
administrative expenses to 27.65 per cent of sales from 29.4 per cent a year
earlier.
Pre-tax earnings jumped 101 per cent to Dollars 41.4m, or 6.77 per cent of
sales, from Dollars 20.6m, or 3.71 per cent of sales, a year earlier.
Nordstrom also said yesterday that it had settled a number of lawsuits
alleging that the company and six of its officers failed to disclose that
Nordstrom might be liable for additional employee compensation arising from
Nordstrom's past employee practices.
In the last year, Nordstrom's reputation has been clouded by a union dispute
and by revelations that the company's commission sales force is not properly
compensated.
Mr Goesling said: 'While we have not yet resolved with our insurance company
their share of this settlement, we are confident that any payment made by
the company will not have a material effect on the results of operations for
the year.'
The settlement, which is subject to court approval, provides for payment of
Dollars 7.5m to shareholders who bought Nordstrom stock between February 1
1988 and March 8 1990.

THE TWO state-owned Venezuelan airlines due to be privatised this year
suffered financial losses in 1990, according to figures published by the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications.
Viasa, the government's international flag-carrier, lost USDollars 34m in
1990 on overall revenues of Dollars 268m, compared with Dollars 4.6m profit
in 1989 on revenues of Dollars 266.7m.
Another state-owned airline, Aeropostal, which flies domestic and
international routes, suffered a 1990 loss of Dollars 7.3m on revenues of
Dollars 82.1m.
In 1989, Aeropostal reported net earnings of Dollars 2.8m on revenues which
totalled Dollars 68.8m. (Dollar figures were calculated using free-market
exchange rates for the Venezuelan bolivar at the end of each year.)
The government of President Carlos Andres Perez is keen to privatise Viasa
and Aeropostal this year to demonstrate that its slow-moving privatisation
programme is finally getting off the ground.
Since the government took office over two years ago, it has privatised only
two commercial banks from a long list of companies it plans to sell off.

SA BREWING Holdings, the diversified Adelaide-based brewing and

The group entered the US water heaters market in 1989 thorough the purchase

The deal, which is subject to US regulatory approval, is expected to be

FLETCHER Challenge (FCL) yesterday announced it had successfully placed
NZDollars 195m (USDollars 115m) worth of shares with international
institutional investors in a move designed to ease its debt burden.
However, the company did not announce the fate of a further 25m shares which
were being offered as oversubscriptions and were not underwritten. It is
hoped these shares would raise the total to NZDollars 292.5m.
News of the unexpected placement forced the share prices sharply lower
yesterday, ending a month-long rally. FCL dropped 22 cents to NZDollars
3.92, which was 2 cents above the placement price for the 50m shares. The
placement was underwritten by brokers CS First Boston NZ and Potter Warburg
Markets.
Mr Hugh Fletcher, FCL chief executive officer, said the placement showed
international investors strongly supported the New Zealand company which has
diverse holdings in the forestry products and building materials industries.
An FCL spokesman said the additional funds would represent a reduction in
group debt levels of about 1.4 per cent.
The company last month revised its forecasts, warning that full-year profits
might be about 10 per cent below the NZDollars 662.4m for the year to June
30 1990.
FCL, the second largest newsprint producer in the world, has suffered from
declining demand for its paper and a drop in prices for pulp and timber.
The spokesman said capital spending peaked last year at NZDollars 1.3bn and
was expected to fall to about NZDollars 800m. He said the group had to sell
all its property interests, valued at about NZDollars 500m held through
Fletcher Construction and Challenge Properties.

THE privatisation of Aerolneas Argentinas, the Argentine national airline,
entered its final phase yesterday, six months after the government and an
international consortium exchanged contracts.
The consortium, led by Spain's Iberia, delivered Dollars 810m-worth of
foreign debt certificates to the government as part of an agreement reached
between the two sides in April.
The privatisation stalled earlier this year after the government and
consortium members squabbled over the terms of the contract. The buyers
refused to pay, while the government refused to deliver the 85 per cent of
Aerolineas shares on sale.
Under the new agreement, the consortium agreed to deliver Dollars 1.61bn in
foreign debt paper in two tranches. It has also provided satisfactory
guarantees from international banks underpinning its Dollars 540m investment
plan in Aerolneas, as required by the original contract.
Earlier, the buyers paid Dollars 142m in government dollar-denominated bonds
worth 68 per cent of face value on the local market, replacing Dollars 130m
in deferred payments due under the original contract.

JOHN LABATT, the Canadian food and beverage group, is putting a large part
of its food processing business up for sale in keeping with its strategy of
concentrating on beer, entertainment and dairy products.
Labatt, which is 39 per cent owned by the Brascan group controlled by Peter

JLFoods, which specialises in frozen grocery products in Canada, the US and
Britain. JLFoods is the leading supplier of frozen soup in the US, and also
a large supplier of breaded and battered products.
The company has annual sales of USDollars 475m and employs 3,500 people at
13 manufacturing and processing plants, most of them in the US.
Analysts said the sale could fetch about USDollars 300m. The company, which
had sales of CDollars 5.3bn (USDollars 4.6bn) last year, has made no secret
of its eagerness to expand its beer business outside Canada.
Labatt's shares rose by 75 cents to CDollars 23.38 yesterday.

APPLE Computer has intro- duced new software for its Macintosh personal
computers with which the company aims to counter competition from
Microsoft's popular Windows program and boost its share of the personal
computer market.
Apple's new System 7 is an enhanced version of the Macintosh operating
system, the program that controls the basic functions of a computer.
The new software 'raises the bar' in what customers will expect from a
personal computer, claimed Mr John Sculley, Apple chairman and chief
executive.
'Macintosh system software is Apple's greatest strength, and we intend to
use this advantage aggressively to become a much bigger player in the
industry,' he said.
'System 7 sets a new standard, thereby widening the gap between what one can
do with a computer, and what one can do with a Macintosh.'
The system includes a new graphical user interface that makes the Macintosh
easier to use, as well as features that enhance the Macintosh's ability to
perform several tasks simultaneously. New Macintosh buyers will get System 7
free with their computers. Most current Macintosh users, however, will have
to upgrade their computers to take advantage of the new software.
System 7 will be offered in the US for Dollars 99. Apple USA also announced
price cuts on the add-on processor and memory boards that will be needed to
upgrade older Macintosh models. The introduction of System 7 demonstrates
that 'Apple is on the offensive,' Mr Sculley claimed.
Many, however, view the software launch as a defensive move aimed at
Microsoft's Windows program which provides IBM-compatible personal computers
with many of the ease-of-use features of the Apple Macintosh.
Apple acknowledged that the introduction of System 7 was delayed for over a
year by technical difficulties.
Although existing Macintosh applications programs will run on System 7,
there are few new programs designed to take full advantage of the new
operating system, analysts noted.

FT  14 MAY 91 / International Company News: Temporary rescue for French
group
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VEV, the struggling French textiles group, yesterday agreed to the terms of
a temporary financial lifeboat worked out by the French government with
VEV's bank creditors in a bid to save the company from outright bankruptcy.
The government and banks will together finance VEV's immediate cash needs
for one month - FFr100m (Dollars 17.1m) to FFr250m - while the banks have
agreed to concessions on a portion of their loans to the debt-ridden group.
At the same time, Mr Christian Derveloy, VEV's chairman, is to resign, and
an audit will be undertaken to see if the textiles group can survive.
The government has been anxious to avert the collapse of a group which
employs 11,000 people, many of them in areas of northern France which
already suffer high unemployment. The Interministerial Committee for
Industrial Reconstruction (CIRI), a unit of the Finance Ministry, has
supervised negotiations between VEV and its banks.
An agreement hammered out over the weekend provides for the bank creditors
to abandon an estimated FFr250m of short-term debt and to convert some
FFr500m of medium-term debt into participating loans.
The banks have also been asked to give up their claim on the shares of a
number of VEV's subsidiaries pledged as security for their loans. This
should facilitate the break-up of the group, if this proves necessary, as
most Paris bankers now fear.
VEV has already sold several of its most profitable subsidiaries, such as
Jalla, Pennel &amp; Flipo and Gravograph, in a bid to reduce its debt burden,
which totalled FFr3.3bn at the end of 1989.
Credit Lyonnais, the state-owned bank, is the most heavily exposed creditor,
with loans understood to total more than FFr1.2bn. Other creditors include
Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), Societe Generale, Credit Commercial de
France (CCF), Credit du Nord and Banque Francaise du Commerce Exterieur
(BFCE).
The banks had earlier flatly refused to accept much broader concessions
proposed by the CIRI.
VEV emerged in 1987 out of the ashes of the Prouvost group, which Mr
Derveloy then managed. Using VEV as his vehicle, Mr Derveloy not only beat
off a stock market assault on Prouvost by the Chargeurs group, but also won
control of the group away from the Prouvost family which had hired him.
Although he succeeded in this battle, Mr Derveloy is generally thought to
have got the worse of a peace deal with Chargeurs signed the following year,
through which he gave up Prouvost's profitable wool trading and carding
operations to Chargeurs, keeping its textiles and clothing divisions.
Mr Regis Bello, formerly chief executive of the A. Dewavrin Fils group, was
expected yesterday to replace Mr Derveloy at the head of the group. Mr
Derveloy was expected to offer to sell his 5.4 per cent VEV stake for a
symbolic FFr1.
VEV's board was due yesterday to finalise 1990's accounts, which are
expected to show a loss of over FFr500m. By yesterday evening, however, the
results had not yet been published.

<TEXT>
POWER Corporation, the Dublin-based property development company, has
announced pre-tax profits for 1990 up from IPounds 10.26m to IPounds 15.59m,
or Pounds 14m sterling.
Turnover increased 13.5 per cent to IPounds 35.12m. After tax of IPounds
3.38m (IPounds 2.31m) earnings per share came out at 10.54p, compared with
8.65p. Mr Robin Power, chairman, said that the company had performed
exceptionally well given the difficult market conditions.
'We are the only property company quoted on the UK market to have achieved
results in line with forecasts of 14 months ago. This is due to the spread
of business between Ireland, the UK and the US.'
The company said the value of its property portfolio at the end of 1990
stood at IPounds 352m, up from IPounds 33m when the company came to the
market at the end of 1987. An independent valuation resulted in net assets
per share of 198p at the year end, compared with 207p.
Power has been involved with Brent Walker, the troubled leisure
conglomerate, in the Trocadero site in central London and in the Blackpool
Tower shopping centre.
Mr Power said that the deal with Brent Walker, involving the swapping of
Brent's 50 per cent stakes in the two developments and Power's 50 per cent
stake in the Island site adjacent to the Trocadero, was still subject to
some consents. 'We had expected things to be finalised two weeks ago but
there have been some hold ups.'
He added that the company intended to retain only 50 per cent of the
Trocadero. When the development was completed and an attractive price could
be obtained the 50 per cent from Brent would be disposed of.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Brent Walker shares drop ahead of loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRENT Walker's shares tumbled yesterday as the heavily borrowed leisure
group confirmed that losses last year would lead to a 'major reduction in
shareholders' funds'.
The company has also delayed announcement of its preliminary results from
tomorrow until next Monday. Brent Walker's shares closed 16p lower at 40p.
'Although the group produced profits at the operating level, it sustained a
substantial loss for the year after taking into account interest,
exceptional items and taxation,' the company said. It made a pre-tax profit
of Pounds 82.2m in the year to December 1989.
The delay in the 1990 results pushes back publication of the financial
restructuring plan Brent Walker is thrashing out with Hill Samuel, the
merchant bank acting as its advisers.
The steering committee of creditor banks, led by Standard Chartered, has yet
to see a Touche Ross report on Brent Walker's assets and liabilities on
which the package will be based. The firm was asked last November for the
report when the banks agreed a standstill on Pounds 1.4bn of debt. Banks
expect a write-down in Brent Walker's asset values of Pounds 1bn to about
Pounds 100m net of debt.

FT  14 MAY 91 / TVS unveils plan to raise equity as it falls into red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TVS Entertainment, the ITV company for the south of England, yesterday
announced pre-tax losses of Pounds 8.3m and cancelled the final dividend at
the same time as unveiling plans to raise new equity.
The new equity will, however, only become available if TVS retains its
lucrative and hotly-contested southern franchise.
TVS declined to give any details on this before tomorrow's deadline for bids
for new 10-year franchises beginning in 1993.
The financial package will include a new shareholder and promises of further
investment from the company's existing French shareholders, Canal Plus, the
subscription channel and Generale d'Images, the communications company.
TVS would need the capital injection to fulfil its programme obligations
because of the losses sustained in the 1988 acquisition of MTM, the US
production company, in a Dollars 320m (Pounds 189m) deal.
At least three well-funded bidders are going for the TVS franchise - MAI,
the marketing and financial services group, Mr Michael Green's Carlton
Communications and the David Frost/Richard Branson joint venture.
TVS yesterday announced losses arising out of a poor performance from the US
group. TVS made a profit of Pounds 16.8m in the year to end-December,
compared with a profit of Pounds 20.8m in the 14 months to the end of 1989.
However, an exceptional provision of Pounds 20.7m was made against US
programme stock. MTM had four new series cancelled by the US networks last
year - Capital News, FM, City and You Take the Kids. In addition, Pounds
4.4m has been set aside for further redundancies.
An extraordinary charge of Pounds 4m, against an extraordinary gain of
Pounds 30.4m a year earlier, resulted in a net loss of Pounds 10.1m, or
17.6p a share, compared with a net profit of Pounds 40m, or 8.8p per share.
Turnover was Pounds 262.1m (Pounds 325.5m).
Earlier this year, TVS tried to sell MTM, famous for programmes such as Hill
Street Blues and St Elsewhere. Despite much interest, no one would pay more
than Dollars 70m. MTM has been withdrawn from the market.
In Britain, TVS increased its share of ITV advertising revenue to 11.4 per
cent - the highest in its history.
The decision that TVS is 'unable to pay further dividends' means that the
interim payout of 3p in November is the final one.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Severn Trent to pay Pounds 212m for BET unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLARE PEARSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERN TRENT, the water company, has agreed to pay Pounds 212m to win Biffa,
one of the UK's leading waste disposal concerns, from BET, the debt-laden
business services group.
The deal means Severn Trent will finally gain a significant presence in
waste management. Last year, Severn Trent decided not to proceed with an
earlier attempt to do so by taking over Caird, a listed company.
BET put Biffa up for sale three months ago, as part of a review of its
funding capabilities and management structure.
Analysts yesterday expected the company's net debt to fall to about Pounds
250m after completion of the sale, which produced proceeds at the top end of
market expectations.
Mr John Bellak, Severn Trent's chairman, said: 'We are delighted to have
been able to buy such a good business at a fair price.'
Mr Nicholas Wills, BET's chairman, said a range of potential acquirers and
joint venture partners had shown interest.
Severn Trent's shares closed 3p down at 277p and BET's were 2p lower at 178p
yesterday.
Biffa, one of the largest presences in the UK waste management business,
made profits before interest of Pounds 17.8m on sales of Pounds 102.3m in
the year to the end of March. No debt is being taken on with Biffa. Mr
Bellak said Severn Trent would be funding it through borrowings incurred by
its public limited company.
The deal intensified speculation about the fate of the 29.9 per cent stake
in Caird with which Severn Trent was left after it dropped its bid last
October, when Caird cut its profit forecast.
Mr Bellak insisted yesterday that all options remained open. Caird's shares
closed unchanged at 75p.
Mr Bellak said that, once Biffa was aligned with the company's existing
business, waste would account for about 15 per cent of total group turnover.
For BET, the sale comes at the end of a turbulent spring which saw a bear
raid on its shares early in February.
A new chief executive, Mr John Clark, took over last month from Mr Wills.
BET has said that it wanted to dispose of Biffa because of the risks arising
from its exposure to environmental legislation.
Mr Martin Bettington stays on as managing director of Biffa, which is best
known for its UK collection and landfill activities.
Using experience acquired in their core water business as a basis for
assuming a wider role in waste management has been a priority for most of
the 10 water companies since they were privatised in November 1989. Severn
Trent's is the biggest step taken in the sector to date.
In February, Wessex Water announced a Pounds 125m joint venture with Waste
Management of the US, one of the world's biggest treatment and disposal
groups.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Drexel details settlement plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DREXEL Burnham Lambert, the US investment bank which filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection 15 months ago, yesterday revealed details of a complex
settlement plan.
Under the agreement, Drexel's estate will be split between creditors and
parties making claims against it under securities law.
The settlement plan comes after judicial pressure to avoid a lengthy,
litigious liquidation.
There are still hurdles but lawyers in the case suggest it could be over by
early 1992, leaving a small 20-person concern to handle Drexel's illiquid
assets.
Under the agreement, the estate - reckoned at more than Dollars 2bn (Pounds
1.15bn) - is divided so that:
Administrative costs of the bankruptcy will be paid first, followed by
Dollars 150m-Dollars 200m of secured claims and a further Dollars 150m
payment into the Securities and Exchange Commission's civil disgorgement
fund;
The next Dollars 1.3bn is split 85:15 between fixed creditors and securities
litigants;
The next Dollars 700m is split 60:40 between the same parties; Thereafter,
the split is 50:50.
About Dollars 300m-Dollars 400m of particularly illiquid assets will go into
a a new entity to be owned by a 'liquidating trust'. This seems likely to be
sold eventually.
Under the plan, all securities litigation against Drexel would cease and
some 200 Drexel employees - though not Mr Fred Joseph, the former chief
executive - would be released from any new litigation claims.
Drexel will also 'pool' its own legal actions with those of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation, which regulates the troubled thrift industry,
and certain securities litigants, in cases where there is a common
defendant. This joint effort could apply in claims against former Drexel
employees, in particular Mr Michael Milken, who headed the lucrative junk
bond operation.
Drexel will get 14 per cent of money collected from such litigation, up to
Dollars 400m.
Perhaps the biggest hurdle is the Internal Revenue Service, which has filed
a Dollars 5.3bn claim and is not included in the settlement plan. Unless a
deal can be struck with the IRS, the merits of this claim will be heard by
the courts next month. If they grant an award above a certain sum -
undisclosed - the settlement agreement could be aborted.

FT  14 MAY 91 / US economic hopes rise as output level stabilises
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US INDUSTRIAL production stabilised in April after six months of decline,
bolstering hopes that the recession may be bottoming out.
A rise of 0.1 per cent in industrial output, while no more than a tentative
pointer, follows other mildly encouraging statistics, including a slower
rate of decline in employment, an increase in the index of leading
indicators and the start of a housing recovery.
The better figures for April, however, were accompanied by revisions to
previous statistics. The Federal Reserve said production fell 0.6 per cent
in March - twice as much as initially estimated. In the first quarter,
industrial production fell at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 9.6 per
cent.
The tiny increase in output last month does not signal that the US recession
is over but it suggests that the rate of decline has eased significantly.
Most forecasters expect the US economy to hit bottom sometime during the
summer and then to begin a weak recovery.
Last month's improvement was led by car and truck production, which
increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 10.8 per cent. This sector
was the biggest depressing influence on the economy in the previous six
months.
Excluding motor vehicles, industrial production fell 0.2 per cent last
month. The weakness was concentrated in non-durable goods, mining and
utilities. Capacity utilisation fell 0.2 points to 78.3 per cent.
The firming of production mostly reflected increases in the output of
durable consumer goods generally, which rose at an annual rate of 3 per
cent. Apart from motor vehicles, sectors sensitive to the cost of money  -
such as furniture, carpeting and home appliances - registered increases.
The industrial production index last month stood at 105.1 compared with 100
in 1987. It was 3.4 per cent below the level of a year ago and about 5 per
cent below the peak hit last September.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Hurd opposes wider role for EC on labour issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES IN the European Community that Britain might be softening its
opposition to EC labour market legislation were dashed yesterday.
Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, told other EC ministers in Brussels
that he was against proposals to extend majority voting - as opposed to
unanimous voting - to labour and social issues. Majority voting would
prevent Britain, or any member state, from vetoing parts of the social
policy programme and allow the EC a greater say in labour and social issues.
'It would be foolish to commit the community to policies in the social and
employment field which involve potentially enormous costs without regard to
growth,' Mr Hurd said.
Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, said: 'I feel like someone
who at the start of this century heard people say that the abolition of
child labour would cause the general collapse of the economy.'
The foreign secretary said Britain had dispelled the cloud of bad industrial
relations that had long hung over it. 'We do not want any pretext for
leading industry back into that situation,' he said.
The UK has been the only opponent of the EC Social Charter but it appeared
to come to terms with some of the legislation, such as written proof of
contracts.
On Monday, Mr Michael Howard, employment secretary, said in an interview
with the Financial Times that Britain now supported most elements of the
social char-ter.
Mr Delors countered Mr Hurd's complaint that social matters would be subject
to over-centralised regulation by saying that the commission was relying
heavily on dialogue between European employers and trade union
organisations.
Other EC ministers re-sponded angrily to Mr Hurd's remarks. Mr Gianni De
Michelis, the Italian foreign minister, warned that Britain could not hope
to get away with vetoing the whole EC political union on social policy
grounds alone.
Mr Mark Eyskens, Belgian foreign minister, suggested that the UK might be
left out of EC social policy-making.
It is unlikely such a compromise would be acceptable to other member states
which might complain that UK industry was escaping the costs of labour
regulation.
The Luxembourg presidency was proposing to extend majority voting to issues
of contractual conditions of employment and management consultation of
workers.
Majority votes now apply only to measures to improve workers' health and
safety, which generally have UK support. Under the Luxembourg plan,
unanimous voting would only be retained for social security issues.

FT  14 MAY 91 / UK consumer credit growth at six-year low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH consumers have been holding back from new borrowing to finance
household goods and other durables although interest rates have fallen and
retail sales rose sharply in March.
The Central Statistical Office reported yesterday that the amounts
outstanding on credit agreements with consumers increased by less in the
first quarter of this year than in any quarter since statistics were first
gathered in the mid-1980s.
The total amount borrowed from finance houses, building societies and on
bank credit cards to purchase consumer goods increased by Pounds 280m to
Pounds 30.03bn in the three months to the end of March. This was the lowest
quarterly increase in this 'narrow' measure of consumer credit business
since records began in 1985. It compares with a quarterly average rise of
Pounds 758m last year.
A broader measure of outstanding consumer credit, which also includes credit
granted in the form of loans by banks on personal accounts and by insurance
companies and retailers, rose by Pounds 840m to Pounds 51.47bn in the same
period. This compares with rises of Pounds 1.03bn and Pounds 1.26bn in the
two previous quarters and is the lowest figure since records began in 1987.
The announcement of the figures, which suggest that recessionary conditions
in the UK are continuing, coincided with the publication of slightly revised
retail sales figures for March, showing a strong volume increase of 3.6 per
cent over February.
The figures show a strong 12.9 per cent surge in the volume of household
goods sales in the month, confirming that the Budget increase in value added
tax to 17.5 per cent from 15 per cent had triggered the retail sales jump.
Household goods are frequently bought on credit but the monthly figures for
narrow credit business showed only a relatively modest increase of Pounds
122m in the amount outstanding in March after increases of Pounds 98m and
Pounds 60m in February and January respectively. Although the March credit
figure was in line with City expectations and had little impact in financial
markets, the difference between the strong growth in retail sales in March
and the subdued appetite of consumers for credit caused some puzzlement
among analysts.
Mr Peter Spencer, UK economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers, said the figures
probably pointed to a recent rise in real incomes as inflation fell.
Consumers had been able to accumulate surplus funds in their bank accounts
and were able to beat the Budget increase in VAT without increasing their
indebtedness, he said.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Bush pledge on chemical weapons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER RIDDELL, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US will renounce the use of chemical weapons 'for any reason' and
destroy all its stockpiles within 10 years once international agreement is
reached banning their use, President George Bush said yesterday.
His announcement is intended to give fresh momentum to international talks
which resume today in Geneva on a chemical weapons convention.
The US move goes beyond a draft agreement signed at the US-Soviet summit in
Washington last June to destroy all but 5,000 tonnes each of their chemical
weapons stocks by 2002. In the first eight years after the signing of an
international agreement, this would be reduced to 500 tonnes. For the US,
this would have meant retaining about 2 per cent of its current total.
The White House has been considering the worldwide chemical weapons
initiative as part of a wider series of arms control moves specifically
affecting the Middle East.
In a statement intended to 'demonstrate the US commitment to banning
chemical weapons', Mr Bush said the US was 'formally forswearing the use of
chemical weapons for any reason, including retaliation, against any state,
effective when the convention enters into force and will propose that all
states follow suit'.
He added that the US 'unconditionally commits itself to the destruction of
all our stocks of chemical weapons within 10 years of entry into force of
the convention'.
Previously the US has retained the right to use chemical weapons in
retaliation - and to keep the 5,000-tonne stockpile - until all nations with
such weapons had agreed to eliminate them.
The US originally wished to keep a residual stockpile as a deterrent against
countries such as Iraq which might use chemical weapons in war but
Washington has changed its view, partly as a result of the Gulf war. The US
not only won through the use of conventional weapons but also had to
consider, and reject, the possible use of its own chemical weapons as a
retaliation against any Iraqi chemical attack - although none materialised.
Under the terms of the United Nations ceasefire resolution, Iraq is required
to hand over all its stocks of chemical weapons to a UN commission for
destruction.
At today's Geneva talks, the US is calling for the resolution of all
important issues by the end of this year and a final treaty within 12
months. The US delegation will ask that the negotiating committee of the
Conference on Disarmament stays in continuous session from now on.

in London, arguing that the activity brings valuable extra liquidity and
market confidence. In Thursday's Quarterly Bulletin, the Bank will provide
new evidence for its case. In gilts, for example, daily lending volume has
nearly trebled since Big Bang - to around Pounds 6bn. But the really
fast-growing market involves the lending of international securities, where
there is a problem. If London is to maintain its lead as a centre for the
trading of international securities and related lending and borrowing, a
solution must be found for the tax treatment of overseas lenders. The faster
the Inland Revenue agrees a fair mechanism, the better. Otherwise, London
will have shot itself in the foot - again.

FT  14 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: British Airways
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The market is inclined to think British Airways will hold its final dividend
next week - and the market is probably right. BA's balance sheet can stand
the strain; the Pounds 20m saved by halving the payout will be dwarfed by
trading losses in the final quarter; the wrath of shareholders is hardly
worth risking in the not unlikely event that cash flows prove insufficient
to meet the group's ambitious capital spending plans.
If the income question dominates the share price in the short term, though,
the issue thereafter is how far BA can recover from the twin traumas of
recession and the Gulf. The outlook at the moment is hazy, with forward
bookings pointing to a 10 to 15 per cent volume downturn year-on-year over
the crucial summer period. The bigger worry is the sharp drop in revenue
yields as the passenger mix shifts towards cheap-fare travellers. To add to
its woes, BA now faces a serious competitive threat on its transatlantic
routes, with the lower cost Virgin certain to put further pressure on
margins as the US carriers United and American go all out for market share.
BA has probably responded as well as any international airline to the
industry's crisis. In a post-Gulf world, however, the relentless growth of
business travel can no longer be taken for granted; and the regulators have
altered the rules.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Meanwhile, it is likely that something more than hairs are being split in
policy discussions between Westminster and Threadneedle Street. The Bank
remains publicly concerned with metaphysical riddles, such as: When is a
crunch not a crunch? (some hours of the Treasury Committee's time went on
this not long ago); and: What is the underlying underlying rate of inflation
(answers on not less than 10 sides of paper). Ministers are increasingly
worried about votes.
The latest statistics suggest they are right to be anxious. The CBI small
firms survey confirms that there is indeed a credit crunch - if you are too
small to borrow outside the banking system. It is small companies who
complain that credit is sometimes difficult, and always too expensive (1 1/2
per cent a month from one clearer). The Bank of England calls that a fall in
credit demand; the victims call it a squeeze, and all too often a fatal one.
That is no way to treat pillars of their local Conservative Associations.
Yesterday's weak credit growth figures also look forbidding. The brief
beat-the-tax-increase retail boom was financed with astonishingly little
borrowing; at these real interest rates, credit demand is indeed price
sensitive. But officials should take care before they cite this as proof
that 'policies are working'. They are likely to be accused of what a former
chancellor called sado-monetarism. Politically switched-on dealers are
likely to pay less than their usual attention to market signals from the
Bank.

Towards the bottom of the roller-coaster, the ride gets bumpy. If the UK is
indeed reaching the trough of the recession, yesterday's bumps are easy to
understand. The retailing and consumer credit figures, Wall Street, the
outlook for UK interest rates - all have a stomach-jolting feel about them.
More jolts ahead: the last two days of the week will bring grim economic
figures (because they are backward-looking) and the Monmouth by-election
result. The Fed, though, shows every sign of taking the US recession
seriously; if that leads to a further easing after today's meeting, Wall
Street's reaction could help London recover its poise, for a day or so at
least.

FT  14 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: Severn Trent places a BET on waste
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,486.6 (-37.7)
The problem with BET's Pounds 212m agreed sale of Biffa to Severn Trent is
its timing. BET not only has a chief executive so new he is unready to
elaborate a corporate strategy following the sale; it is also in purdah
ahead of its annual results, so the precise shape of its balance sheet can
only be guessed at.
The most one can say is that BET will now be in much better financial
health: it could scarcely be worse. Assuming net debt of Pounds 240m, its
gearing might be 40 per cent, against 86 per cent. Treating its AMPS
(auction market preferred stock) as debt, gearing has dropped to around 150
per cent.
BET has every reason to be satisfied with an exit multiple of 18, close to
what it always said the assets should fetch. With a guaranteed 9p final
dividend, its shares are already on a prospective yield of 6.7 per cent; add
in the interim payment and the yield is just under 10 per cent. This seems
about right until the group sets out its plans. Only a few weeks ago, after
all, the shares were yielding more than half as much again.
It is Severn Trent's shareholders who might have cause for concern, given
that the price is well above rumoured sighting shots of nearer Pounds 170m
and will probably mean dilution for a couple of years. The diversification
into waste management is sensible enough, but Severn's record is hardly
inspiring - remember Caird. The quality of Biffa's earnings is not so
self-evident that Severn can claim a definite success. Any revaluation of
Biffa's implied Pounds 85m of assets will make interesting reading. If it
finally does buy Caird later this year, Severn will have a national spread
in the management of waste. Shareholders must hope it does not become a
waste of management.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Green profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Japanese delegation visited a new steelworks in the north of England. It
was losing money. The visitors made money using the same machinery in Japan.
Asked for advice, they came up with 57 nit-picking suggestions. For example,
the British opened their furnace doors to provide an 18-inch gap through
which to shoot finished rods; for the same process the Japanese opened their
doors only six inches. The saving on heat loss was measurable, and
contributed to the profits earned by the Japanese company.
This story was told by Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, last
week. His lecture is one of the most effective pieces of sales talk for a
hard-headed environmental policy I have seen from any British minister - and
I do not forget Mrs Margaret Thatcher's stirring words about how all we have
of the earth is a life tenancy, with a full repairing lease. Mr Heseltine
does not preach green virtue. There is a paucity of phrases about saving the
planet. Instead there was a large dose of Heseltiniana ('what we need is . .
. a green renaissance of Britain's economy'), spiced with juicy vistas of
multibillions to be made from clean-ups and the production of greener goods.
'Where there's muck there's brass,' the secretary of state reminded his
audience, quoting an estimate that Pounds 850bn will be spent in the
European Community between now and 2000 on new capital equipment,
environmentally-friendly products and associated services. The British share
would be Pounds 140bn. In his characteristically self-effacing way he has
posted copies of the speech to 1,000 chief executives and asked them to join
a 'green club'.
It is customary to question Mr Heseltine's motives. I do not think that in
this address he was primarily concerned with chasing votes for the
Conservative party. His belief is that public concern for the environment
wanes during a recession, when unemployment and the like seem more pressing.
His speech, with its touches about Europe and partnership with industry,
contains an unspoken element of 'this is what you would have had if I had
been prime minister instead of John Major', but only enough to assuage a
modicum of vanity, nothing threatening or out of line. After all, he joined
forces with his ideological opposite - the industry secretary, Mr Peter
Lilley - to make Mr John Collins, Shell UK's chairman, head of a 23-member
advisory committee on business and the environment.
So let us take Mr Heseltine's words at face value. If they favour
regulation, or the setting of standards, they do so on the basis of the
argument that the country with the highest standards will be the one with
the German cars emit the waste-gas equivalent of Chanel No. 5
most competitive manufacturers. We all know, or should, the story of how the
Germans have made their cars exhaust the waste-gas equivalent of Chanel No.
5, with other car makers having to follow. Consumers, and regulators, demand
it.
This beady-eyed approach is to be found in a new book, Costing The Earth, by
Frances Cairncross, environment editor of The Economist newspaper. Ms
Cairncross provides a checklist of a dozen suggestions for company chairmen,
starting with 'put the most senior person possible in charge of
environmental policy'. Her arguments, which are those of a market economist,
seek at each point to attempt some measure of the costs as well as the
benefits of a particular green policy. Thus she says that it would make
sense for African governments to form an ivory cartel, rather than ban the
trade in tusks. That would eliminate middlemen, drive up prices - and ensure
that the elephant survives to earn future revenue. She refers to botanists
who develop non-timber products to demonstrate that rain forests standing
can be worth more than rain forests destroyed.
Among the many sources quoted is the Yale economist Professor William
Nordhaus, who apparently accepts that the benefits of banning
chlorofluorocarbons, responsible for the hole in the ozone layer may
outweigh the costs. But the goal of stabilising carbon dioxide output in
2000 at 1990 levels is alleged to be more costly to achieve than would be
the benefits of avoiding global warming. Ms Cairncross dutifully records
some of the green challenges to the Nordhaus equation, but implies that even
if his sums are wrong his methodology has to be addressed.
The question is, should it be? 'Ultimately, it is easier to think of
environmental issues in terms of ethics than of discount rates,' she writes.
'Most people feel comfortable with the idea that their descendants ought to
enjoy the same natural inheritance as they have themselves received.' She
manages, nevertheless, to fill 256 pages of recycled paper with merciless
analyses of every green proposition.
I would not, however, accuse her, or Mr Heseltine, of confusion. Just
because you are convinced of the imminence of catastrophe is no reason not
to do a few sums. Both the minister and the author accept the precautionary
principle - that in case the worst predictions are right it pays to do
something now. Both perceive that one practical response to the global
upsurge of green sentiment, which Ms Cairncross chronicles, is to use the
profit motive as the driving force for change. Freer than any minister, Ms
Cairncross can argue forcefully for higher energy prices, even taxes on
energy.
In short the agenda is no longer controlled by the goodly folk who first
brought it to our attention. It is part of everyday discourse, and subject
to its rigours. I believe that when the economy picks up, and perhaps
another discovery takes us a few notches higher up the curve of fear, the
costs of not protecting the future will loom larger, and professor
Nordhaus's flawed equations will have to be re-worked. Meanwhile, watch how
you open those furnace doors.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Letter: Government cover for private export insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MALCOLM STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Price rightly points out (Letters, May 9) that some other EC
governments provide export credit insurance cover for the more risky
importing countries though they may do this indirectly through
private-sector companies. This is indeed the set-up which will apply in the
UK following the privatisation of the Insurance Services Group of the Export
Credits Guarantee Department. Mr Lilley - in the remarks to parliament to
which Mr Price refers (May 2) - was making the point that the proposed
changes to ECGD will bring it more into line with arrangements in other EC
countries.
As the minister for trade made clear at the report stage of the Export and
Investment Guarantees Bill, the government, after privatisation of Insurance
Services, will provide 100 per cent reinsurance through the continuing ECGD
for business on a handful of importing countries which are not at present
acceptable to the private reinsurance market. He stressed that the need for
this will be kept under review but, subject to satisfactory financial
performance within ECGD's trading account, it will continue for as long as
the government considered it essential to meet exporters' reasonable needs.
This support is likely to be a relatively minor ECGD facility, applying to
only about Pounds 300m a year of exports - not because of government
reluctance to provide a larger facility, but simply because of the
successful progress in negotiating arrangements with the private reinsurance
market which should ensure that the bulk of Insurance Services risks - both
commercial and political - will be placed in the private market upon
privatisation.
It is, perhaps, in this latter respect that future UK arrangements may
differ from those in some other EC countries. The government's aim has been
to privatise the business of Insurance Services. This would not be achieved
if a large element of that business continued to be reinsured by government,
particularly when it could be placed in the private market. The government
has, therefore, sought to maximise the scope of private market reinsurance
in a way that some other EC governments may not yet have done and which is
not damaging to UK exporters' interests.
It is a difference of degree, rather than principle. The government believes
that this approach is already being reflected in steps being taken in
virtually every other EC country to increase private sector involvement in
the provision of export credit insurance.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Leading Article: A compromise path to Emu
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER THE informal meeting of European Community finance ministers over the
weekend, plans for the EC's expedition to Economic and Monetary Union are
becoming clearer. Those plans may not be to everyone's liking; indeed, they
are probably to nobody's liking. Nevertheless, they represent a sensible
compromise.
Participants will not be allowed to prevent others from starting out towards
Emu, merely because they are unwilling to depart themselves; nor may they
insist on going in the vanguard, however unfit for that position they might
be; and even though countries may move at different speeds, each will do so
under supervision. The goal will not be reached much before the end of the
decade, while a European Central Bank is unlikely to be constructed before
its attainment. Finally, the move towards Emu may require a new budgetary
deal for the EC.
One point now seems clear. The British will have to change their plans
radically. This is not surprising, because they were absurd. The UK not
merely told the other 11 that it was unwilling to go where they wanted, but
intimated that the UK might veto the others' plans. Meanwhile, Britain
insisted that the others should not set out without it, because this would
leave it in the slower group within a 'two-speed' Europe. Further to enhance
the UK's reputation as a team player, it recommended that they should go
somewhere altogether different, towards the 'hard ecu'.
Poor chances
Since the UK's 'hard ecu' plan involves creating a new monetary institution,
which the Germans abhor, and does not introduce a single currency, which the
French (and others) desire, its political chances are close to zero. The
economic merits of the plan are greater than that, but this matters little.
The plan will have to be abandoned.
It was always inconceivable that the UK would veto a treaty on which the
others were determined, any more than it could prevent others from moving to
Emu. The best it could hope for was a degree of influence upon the pace and
nature of the move towards Emu, while not being forced into it itself.
The likely compromise cannot resolve all of the UK's political problems.
Acceptance of a treaty implies a commitment. Once it exists, the UK will
find itself confronted with a choice between participation, on the one hand,
and consignment to the slow group in a 'two-speed' Europe, on the other. The
treaty will certainly call for increased surveillance of economic policy. It
may imply greater fiscal transfers within the EC as well.
Shared interest
The need for parliament to ratify such a treaty is a recipe for trouble. But
since that trouble will arise within the two big parties as much as between
them, they share an interest in making as little as possible of one of the
most important decisions the country will ever take.
All this assumes that the other 11 can agree on the path to Emu. They can do
so, provided that they accept the terms of the one country that does have a
veto. The Germans will not accept the creation of a European Central Bank
before the new currency is introduced, are most unlikely to tolerate a
central bank not at least as independent as the Bundesbank and will not
consent to participation by countries that have not achieved a high degree
of convergence on the German standard.
These conditions are likely to be accepted (or at least appear to be
accepted). Difficulties would still remain. Convergence of inflation is
desirable, for example, but central control over the fiscal policies of
member states is not. How, then, will the EC deal with the problems created,
not by Greece and Portugal (which are economically insignificant), but by
Italy's huge public debt?
What the path to Emu will not involve is still clearer than what it will,
just as who will not be in the vanguard is more obvious than who will. For
all that, there is progress. The shape of the agreement is emerging. It is
one that will impose discomfort upon many - upon the UK above all, but not
only upon the UK.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Leading Article: A charter for consumers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE prime minister has set himself the task of completing work on his
citizens' charter this summer. If the charter is to form the centrepiece of
the Conservative election manifesto, he would be wise to review his holiday
plans - for while the aims are admirable, many important questions about the
charter's implementation need to be answered if sceptical consumers are to
be convinced of its merits.
The charter is designed to raise the quality of public services which cannot
immediately be privatised or exposed to competition through contracting out.
Budgetary controls can force service providers to make more efficient use of
limited resources, but there is often little that consumers can do to ensure
that their preferences are satisfied. The citizens' charter - more
appropriately a consumers' charter - would strengthen the consumer's voice
with two innovations to mimic the relationship between buyer and seller in
market transactions.
The first would create a contract between the service provider and the
consumer which specified the services to be provided. Thus BR might make the
commuter a range of promises on matters such as punctuality, cleanliness and
reliability of services. NHS patients could be guaranteed treatment within
time limits which depended on the seriousness of the complaint. Council
tenants would be entitled to repairs within a specified period.
Direct redress
This contract would be enforced by the consumer through the second
innovation: simple and direct channels of redress. So there might be rebates
or discounts when a train was repeatedly cancelled. More radically, a
consumer whose NHS operation was cancelled could be entitled to reasonable
reimbursement for the cost of private treatment (some local authorities
already reimburse tenants for the cost of repairs in such circumstances).
So far, so good, if a challenge to the imagination. But when it comes to the
details of how the charter would operate, substantive proposals are lacking.
For a start, which services will be covered? It is hard to see the charter
having much to say about education, unless it offers to pick up the fees for
Eton for parents let down by their local comprehensive. And what is to stop
managers re-organising services to avoid penalties, simply by sharing the
misery around more equally?
Then there are the cost implications of compensating dissatisfied customers.
Even if redress is only in the form of modest cash payments (as BT now
offers when it fails to keep home appointments), the cost is born by other
customers either in higher charges or worse service. The costs become much
more substantial if they empower the customer to claim back the cost of
private provision when the public service fails. For the NHS to make a
similar offer could lead to a rapid explosion of costs unless the service
targets were so modest as to be empty.
Consumers' interests
Consumer empowerment needs more than just redress systems. The evidence
suggests that only a small minority of consumers ever use such systems - and
those in most need are often least able to do so. The achievement of the
regulators who oversee the newly-privatised utilities suggests a model for
advancing the interests of consumers which could be extended to the public
services, although a public service regulator could not use his private
counterpart's most effective weapon - price restraint - in services which
are free at the point of consumption.
Questions such as these do not present insuperable problems, but finding
answers requires a willingness to confront hard issues. Some public services
are poor because they are badly managed: the citizens' charter could
certainly encourage improvements. Others are underfunded, and a charter
would only expose the low levels of service which have become the norm.
To improve many of Britain's public services requires a combination of
consumer power and extra investment. Charters alone will not guarantee the
improvement in public services which all parties now seem committed to
delivering in the 1990s.

The only certain way of determining the real worth of a company car to
employees - and despite Norman Lamont's best endeavours, they still seem to
be a sight more attractive than a 'go-anywhere' London Underground ticket -
is when the purring little perk is taken away from them.
According to advertising agency Foote Cone &amp; Belding, which has just
de-wheeled its staff, the answer is anywhere between Pounds 3,000 and Pounds
7,000 - the range of pay rises it has handed out by way of compensation.
Other companies seem likely to follow suit, notwithstanding threats from
Customs and Excise to levy VAT on those who, unlike some of their
colleagues, decline the cash option and keep the wheels.
FCB owned a fleet of 80 cars with a balance sheet worth of Pounds 1m and an
annual cost - in terms of servicing, insurance and depreciation  - of Pounds
500,000 and decided enough was enough.
Chris Whitworth, the agency's finance director, says that the costs of
providing the company car simply became prohibitive. He reckons many of
those whose cars were taken away have not even bothered to replace them.

One thing unlikely to change after the weekend elections in Nepal, land of
timeless beauty, is the time.
The Himalayan kingdom is thought to be the only country in the world which
lives in its own, 15-minute time warp. Since 1985, it has set its clocks
four hours and 45 minutes ahead of GMT - a quarter of an hour in advance of
neighbouring India.
Such demonstrations of independence carry great weight in a country trapped
between the giants of India and China. But some Nepalis insist the
difference is strictly scientific.
Time is determined by the longitude of the centre of a country, which in
India was set during the Raj at 82.5 degrees. That longitude goes nowhere
near Nepal, let alone cuts it in half, according to Gopal Sharma, chief
reporter at the country's government-owned newspaper, The Rising Nepal.
Religion, it seems, also plays a part in setting the clocks. The longitude,
which actually divides Nepal and provides the reference point for local
time, cuts through a mountain called Gauri Shanker named after the wife of
Lord Shiva, the Hindu god of destruction and rebirth.
If the Congress party, the centrist group backed by India, emerges
victorious, there could be pressure to realign Nepalese time. But as Shiva
can bestow power upon those who please him, any sensible politician with an
ounce of ambition
may be best advised to leave well alone.

Let us not be beastly to the Germans, but are they really the dedicated,
horny-handed toilers they are made out to be? According to the German
Economic Institute, they seem increasingly ready to bunk off work and head
for the nearest beer hall.
The institute reckons those employed in industry should be clocking up an
average of just over 1,650 hours a year. But they are typically falling 145
hours short - for the most part, strange though it may seem, on Mondays and
Fridays.
By comparison the British, no longer the sick men and women of Europe, are
expected to put in more than 1,750 hours - and record a 'no show' for only
119 of same.
Both, however, look lazy alongside the Japanese who on average should be in
the factory for more than 2,200 hours each year, and bow out for a mere 36
hours.
The dedication of the Japanese could be something to do with the widespread
belief that while you can be sick, it must be in your own time and at your
own expense. The absence of the Germans, it appears, could be put down to
the generous compensation available and to competition among doctors to hang
on to patients by never knowingly refusing a sick note.

It is hardly surprising that by the time Sir Bernard Ingham left 10 Downing
Street, Maggie's craggy mouthpiece was not on good terms with Sir Geoffrey
Howe, who helped to jemmy the iron lady out of power. The surprising thing
is that relations between the two men did not suffer a good while earlier,
given an incident in 1981.
Oddly enough, it is not recalled in the much publicised memoirs in which
Ingham, bulky and indispensable like the great lady's handbag, has given a
compelling if not entirely unbiased account of his days and nights in Number
10. Puffed-up media lobby correspondents with mischievous motives, and
ministers who wilfully spoke out of turn come in for considerable stick.
What happened in 1981 was that Ingham himself quickly learned, at both his
and Sir Geoffrey's expense, about the danger of making unguarded, albeit
unattributable, remarks to the 'reptiles' - to borrow Denis Thatcher's
epithet - of the parliamentary lobby.
With Britain struggling to escape recession, Ingham found himself late at
night in a Copenhagen hotel room with assorted lobby reporters topping up
tumblers and bemoaning a boring EC summit meeting bogged down by quotas on
Japanese car and video-recorder imports.
Surely, they goaded the chief press secretary, Margaret Thatcher's free
market philosophy could not embrace artificial restraints on trading? Ingham
agreed, conceding that the only reason such measures were necessary at the
time was to protect a British economy in a 'bloody awful' state.
The tabloids sobered up and splashed their front pages with the quotation,
attributed to a 'top Thatcher aide'. As if that would not have been bad
enough in itself, Sir Geoffrey who was then chancellor had just stretched
the nation's credibility by pronouncing 'we have come to the end of the
recession'.
Howe was highly unamused; Ingham a little bit wiser.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Uphill fight in the high street / Chart the continuing
struggle of Britain's consumer services sector as it fights to survive
recession
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
South Molton Street's designer clothes stores shut up shop for a few hours
yesterday in a protest against a proposed rent rise.
The threatened rent rise looked the last straw for the stores on one of
London's most fashionable shopping streets. Like other retailers, travel
companies and leisure groups that make up the consumer service sector, they
are struggling against the worst recession most of them have known.
Several companies have gone bust. The collapse of International Leisure
Group (ILG) and Lewis's department stores alone cost nearly 4,000 jobs.
Other companies can only hope that they can cling on until the autumn when
economists expect the outlook to be brighter.
Why has this sector, once seen as the key to Britain's economic resurgence,
suffered so severely in this recession? Are its difficulties purely a
product of short-term economic pressure, or are they related to longer-term
changes in consumer markets? And what will the sector look like after the
recession?
Consumer services were relatively resilient in the last recession of
1980-81. This was because real interest rates were comparatively low - in
that base rates were lower than inflation - and companies had been run
cautiously after the oil shocks of the mid-1970s. There was relatively
little expansion in leisure, entertainment and even in retailing. Video
shops, theme parks, superstores and multiplex cinemas were all in their
infancy in the early 1980s.
This recession is different. Real interest rates are high and the consumer
sector is far larger. The latest unemployment figures show that employment
in the service sector (which includes commercial as well as consumer
services) fell by 82,000 to 15.76m in the final quarter of 1990. Marks and
Spencer, which is today expected to disclose static profits, recently
announced 850 redundancies.
Moreover, many consumer service companies are burdened by high borrowings
after a decade of expansion. When interest rates rose and consumer spending
declined, companies such as ILG and Lewis's could no longer afford to pay
the interest on their debt. Brent Walker, the troubled leisure group which
owns William Hill betting shops and Brighton Marina, is still struggling to
restructure the Pounds 1.4bn debt amassed in its acquisitions of the 1980s.
Certain areas of consumer services have emerged unscathed. This is mainly
because some groups of consumers are better off thanks to high interest
rates, notably the over-50s, with low mortgages and high savings, and the
under-25s, who have few financial commitments.
The companies that service these particular customers are still faring well.
Blackpool Pleasure Beach is busy, partly thanks to its popularity with the
over-50s. The beach has invested heavily in new attractions for them, such
as the afternoon karaoke 'sing-alongs' in the Cabaret Rooms. So far this
season, despite rain and recession, attendance levels are 14 per cent higher
than last year.
The cinema is flourishing too, partly because of its appeal for the
under-25s. Cinemas enjoyed their best year for a decade in 1990 with average
weekly admissions of 1.88m people. So far this year, they have fared even
better with average admissions of 1.94m a week in the first quarter.
But pleasure beaches and cinemas are the exceptions. The worst-affected
companies are those catering for the 25 to 40-year-olds, the 'yuppies' of
the 1980s, many of whom bought property near the peak of the housing market
and are now saddled with hefty mortgage repayments and credit card debt.
The 'designer' shopping centres that opened in the 1980s, such as Tobacco
Dock in east London, are littered with boarded-up windows. Restaurants are
suffering too. Mr Alistair Little, who runs the eponymous restaurant in
London's Soho, first noticed the slowdown towards the end of last year. His
regulars have since been eating out less often and spending less on their
meals.
Companies linked to the housing market have also suffered. Home furniture,
one of the first areas to be affected, saw sales fall by 6 per cent in real
terms to Pounds 4.7bn last year. This was devastating for Lowndes Queensway,
one of the biggest furniture retailers which had just completed a Pounds
450m leveraged buy-out. Last summer, Lowndes called in the receiver.
In general, the recession has accentuated the difference between the
stronger and weaker players. In the pubs market, Mr Peter Jarvis, chief
executive of Whitbread, one of the biggest brewers, has noted the difference
between 'good pubs in large premises with decent facilities' which are still
doing well and the 'bad pubs in run-down areas' which are 'finding life very
difficult'.
When the end of the recession comes into sight later this year, the critical
question for the consumer service sector is what its long-term consequences
will be.
Some areas of consumer services are unlikely to return to their
pre-recession buoyancy. The designer shops and expensive restaurants in the
'yuppie' market would probably have contracted even without the economic
downturn. The self-indulgent young adults of the 1980s are now settling into
the responsibilities of family life as they enter their 30s.
Other areas will return to growth once the economy recovers. In furniture
retailing, where rationalisation has been severe - the number of stores has
fallen by 600 to about 14,000 in the past five years - there is sure to be
scope for re-investment.
The established companies, such as Magnet and MFI, are so burdened by debt
that new investors may move into the market. Argos, the catalogue retailer,
has been studying furniture retailing for several years and now plans to
open four stores. Ikea, the Swedish group which already owns three UK
furniture stores, plans to accelerate its expansion by opening up to 15
stores by the mid-1990s.
In other markets such as pubs, where rationalisation has been less intense,
the recession has tended to accelerate existing trends. The brewers have
speeded up the process of closing down their smaller, scruffier pubs in
favour of concentrating investment on more promising premises. Whitbread
shut 350 of its 6,650 pubs last year and spent Pounds 250m on new pubs and
restaurants such as Wayside Inns, its upmarket traditional country pubs.
But all consumer service companies face the challenge of getting to grips
with the long-term changes in the marketplace.
One important issue is the change in demographics: the decline in the number
of teenagers and the corresponding growth of the elderly population. This
poses obvious problems for businesses like fashion shops and theme parks
that depend on the teenage market.
Burton, which owns the Top Shop teenage fashion chain, is in the middle of a
strategic review of all its operations. Sears, which owns Miss Selfridge and
Dolcis, is reshuffling its retail portfolio. The focus of its investment is
now on 'family' concepts such as Adams children's wear shops and the Olympus
sports chain.
Alton Towers, the Staffordshire theme park owned by Pearson (which owns the
Financial Times), is concentrating its investment on enhancing its appeal to
families. In the past, it has relied on 'white knuckle' rides to attract the
thrill-seeking under-25s (who represented two-thirds of its 2m visitors last
year). It is now spending Pounds 6m on two new family rides - the Haunted
House and Runaway Mine Train - in the hope of attracting more family groups
to lessen the blow of the shrinking teenage market.
Demographic changes will also intensify the financial pressure on the
sector, notably on retailers and fast food chains, which have traditionally
depended on a regular influx of teenage employees on low wages.
These companies are already examining alternatives. McDonald's, the fast
food group, is developing a programme for part-time managers so some
employees, notably women with children, can return to work after career
breaks. It is also recruiting older managers who have spent most of their
careers in other industries.
The shortage of teenage recruits will almost certainly force companies to
offer higher pay, thereby increasing overheads at a time when they already
face rising property costs due to rent and rate reviews, like those on South
Molton Street.
Demographic and financial pressures aside, the chief challenge for the
service sector is to respond to the continuing demand from consumers for
higher quality in terms of products and service. This was one of the main
trends of the 1980s and has continued, despite the recession, as the pattern
of trading in pubs suggests.
In some markets, the drive towards higher quality means the successful
companies will be those that continually invest in improving their products.
The brewers will carry on upgrading their pubs. A recent study by the
Brewer's Society suggested that as many as 8,000 of Britain's 80,000 pubs
will close over the next decade so the brewers can concentrate resources on
their larger, more modern pubs.
Similarly, food retailers will continue the process of closing their old
supermarkets to concentrate investment on new superstores, the giant stores
selling everything from avocados to ankle socks.
M and S, which already runs eight edge-of-town clothing and food stores,
plans to open up to 25 over the next few years. Tesco has identified 200
prospective sites, many of which will be superstores. However, Sir Ian
MacLaurin, Tesco's chairman, said it also plans to stay in the high street
by developing 'high-quality neighbourhood stores'.
In other markets, the quality trend could create opportunities for
expansion. These will be the less 'mature' markets, such as restaurants and
hotels, that have been constrained by the comparatively unsophisticated
taste of British consumers. The British undoubtedly became more cosmopolitan
during the 1980s but most Britons have never tasted pizza and still stay at
home for their holidays.
This means that companies like Forte, the hotel group, can expect to expand
by 'converting' new consumers, in its case the people who do not usually
stay in hotels. One of Forte's most successful concepts is the five year-old
Travelodge budget chain.
Travelodge, which offers a standard package of a double room for the fixed
price of Pounds 29.95, is designed for the leisure travellers who cannot
afford luxury hotels but are wary of the poor facilities in bed and
breakfasts. There are now 81 Travelodges. Forte plans to open 40 a year at
least until 1995.
Forte may be right and the British will have become converts to hotel
holidays - and pizza eating - by the end of the 1990s. But in the meantime,
Forte, South Molton Street and the rest of the consumer service sector face
at least another six months of financial pressure as they wait for the end
of the recession.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Arts: Machinery of war / Review of exhibitions in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARY ROSE BEAUMONT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'My subject is War, and the pit of War' wrote Wilfred Owen in 1918, just
before he was killed. David Smith's 'Medals for Dishonor' are about anger,
as well as pity, anger against warmongers and the exploiters of the
defenceless. Smith is best known in this country as a welder of large
abstract sculptures in stainless steel. The Tate Gallery owns a fine 'Cubi'
of 1964, now augmented, thanks to a generous loan by his daughters of two
earlier, more figurative sculptures. Again, thanks to the family, we can now
see the extraordinary series of fifteen bronze reliefs which he made between
1937 and 1940 at the Imperial War Museum, brilliantly displayed in glass
cabinets.
Unlike his contemporary American abstract expressionists, Smith travelled
widely in Europe in 1935-36, ending up in Britain. He was a violent opponent
of rising Fascism in Germany and Italy, and his awareness of the Spanish
Civil War was strengthened by seeing Picasso's 'Guernica' when it was
exhibited in New York. The specific impetus for the Medals was a visit to
the British Museum in May, 1936, where he saw a display of First World War
medals by German and French artists. He was especially drawn to the savage
propaganda of the German medals, which he related to the disintegrating
political situation in America.
Smith's targets were politicians, diplomats, the press (in particular,
William Randolph Hearst), the clergy and what he called 'War Exempt Sons of
the Rich,' whose medallion has a Greek inscription translating as 'soft
cookies' across the centre. The imagery is strongly influenced by European
Surrealism, especially Dali, and he borrows Picasso's symbolic use of the
bull to represent the 'disemboweller of the lie of Franco.' Smith also
quotes from Goya's 'Disasters of War' and draws on the apocalyptic language
of paintings by Bosch and Breughel. The medallions were made with extreme
difficulty, using dentists' and jewellers' tools on hard dental stone.
Smith's anger seems quite literally to bubble through the surface. The first
(and only, as it turned out) edition was cast in bronze and exhibited in
1940 to a distinct lack of acclaim. Since none was sold, they have remained
in the family and are now exhibited with related drawings. Taken together,
the ferocious anti-war and anti-corruption statements which they make are as
relevant today as they were then. (Until June 23).
*****
Denis Masi is also concerned with the machinery of conflict, with man's
never-ending desire for territorial expansion at the expense of the weak,
with paraphernalia of domination which includes imprisonment and
surveillance. Masi's concepts are based on issues and polemics, which until
recently have been more appropriately displayed as installations in public
places. With the new wall work, Masi has come off the street and into two
galleries, Edward Totah and Anderson O'Day. Although he has moved away from
installations, the work has lost none of its impact. Elegant and beautifully
crafted, Masi's wall pieces lie in wait, crouched by sleek feline creatures,
waiting to pounce on the imagination.
The smoothly finished weld mesh and copper cladding of 'Border No. 3' does
not conceal that it is about territory, both physical and psychological,
whether it be Northern Ireland, Kuwait or Kurdistan. The searchlight,
described as a found object, in 'Make It Known,' speaks volumes to the
collective memory of watchtowers at Buchenwald or Long Kesh. Many of the
pieces include a mirror, which gives the viewer back his own image and,
inserted into oxydised copper, as a narrow, horizontal strip behind a weld
mesh cage, must also be understood as an observation device. Either way, the
viewer is drawn into complicity with the artist. 'Territorial Imperative,'
incorporates corrugated steel, a flue and louvers. Uneasily, we wonder
whether we are in a mortuary or a hospital, the flue perhaps an escape route
for smoke from a crematorium. (Until May 25.)
Far removed from politics and the sturm und drang of warring nations are
Lucy Jones's rapturous paintings of her native city at the Flowers East
gallery. Born and bred in London, she celebrates its buildings and monuments
in dazzling colours. Not since Derain, in imitation of Monet, was sent here
by his dealer in 1905 has London been recorded with such panache. Like Monet
and Derain, Jones is magnetised by the river. Drawn to it repeatedly, she
paints it in a variety of moods and colours; the dolphins on the lamp-posts
along the embankment take on a vigorous life of their own, here green and
red, there purple and brown.
Buses and cars lollop round Trafalgar Square like Dinky toys or hurtle
towards Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament. Jones's rainbow-hued London is
the city of her mind, bearing little relation to the archetypal grey, wet
Saturday afternoon. Her self-portraits are a new avenue down which she has
raced full tilt, revelling in the permutations of colour contrast: Van Gogh
sunflower yellow is the background for the violet-clad artist in the
full-length portrait, 'All of Lucy Jones.' (To May 26.)
*****
Laura Ford's paintings and sculptures at Benjamin Rhodes Gallery have a
superficial look of innocence, which proves to be entirely false. Little
girls, dressed in neat embroidered pinafores, stand atop full mountains of
foam cushions. Their childish appearance is subverted by a menacing pair of
pistols, whilst in place of a head there is a tangled mass of Gorgon locks
or a bursting flower. Surrealism is disturbingly mixed up with nursery rhyme
illustration, more Struwelpeter than Kate Greenaway. Far from being a Teddy
Bears' Picnic, the painting 'Shagpile' looks more like a gang-bang or ritual
slaughter. Ford's declared liking for the sinister cautionary tales of
Patricia Highsmith is made visible in her frightening and unpleasant
subtext. (To June 8.)

FT  14 MAY 91 / Arts: Same Old Moon - Globe Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
  By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After having seen the first part of Same Old Moon at the re-opening of the
Oxford Playhouse last month, one went to its arrival in London with the
heart somewhere between the knees and the boots. Yet it is amazing what hard
work and a better stage can bring. This is not another Dancing at Lughnasa,
and not only because Geraldine Aron does not write as well as Brian Friel -
it would be hard to do that. Ms Aron's piece also lacks the imagination and
the ability to create a world on its own that are so conspicuous in Dancing.
But, seen at the Globe, it is not a bad play.
The Oxford theatre is cramped and box-like, perhaps fatally so. The Globe
has space enough to illustrate the title. The moon shines on Dublin, Galway,
London and such faraway places as Rhodesia (as Zimbabwe then was) and
Australia. The question is whether it is always the same moon. One answer is
given by the Irish barman who turns on the wireless and hears of the
Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour. 'Always the same old news,' he says in
disgust as he turns it off. In other words, it depends on the way you look
at it.
Brenda, now beautifully played by Gabrielle Reidy with a confidence that the
same actress did not have in Oxford, is catholic, Irish, and wants to get
away and write. She has a father who appears to dislike her. Almost on his
deathbed he confesses it is because they are too similar. He admires her,
however, because unlike him she does not think that it is always the same
old moon. She goes off and does things.
The play has some strong vignettes. A nun demonstrates to Brenda the act of
procreation with a phallus-shaped biscuit and a doughnut. Brenda exchanges
one of her first kisses in return for a ride on a bicycle: it is the bicycle
that gets bent and broken. Best of all is the letter from the Vatican in
response to Brenda's appeal to the Pope. It is signed by Monsignor Flaherty
who adds in brackets 'formerly Martin Flaherty' of a road in Galway.
There are also some cliches: too many attempted jokes about sex and
catholicism. It is not particularly funny that Brenda's father (played by
James Ellis and looking curiously like Sir Bernard Ingham) should adopt all
the prejudices of an Alf Garnett when he arrives in London, complaining
about Pakistanis running the hospital and Jews running the country. A
longish sequence which is devoted to what happens to women when they start
wearing a dressing gown must have been played at least a dozen times before,
though I suppose it has a twist at the end: it is the fear of the same old
dressing gown that spurs Brenda on again.
For my taste it is too Irish, sentimental and maudlin, but others may well
like it and Jenny Killick's direction has improved beyond measure since
Oxford.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Arts: The Black Rider - Berlin Theatre Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To kill your wife in a shooting accident is one thing; to turn the episode
into a musical would seem, gall aside, to invite theatrical fiasco in the
worst of taste. Add lyrics that slide between German and English, a set that
crosses von Sternberg with a western, rock music with fairground honky-tonk,
and disaster looks assured.
So it is with reluctant but moonstruck admiration that I report The Black
Rider (text: William Burroughs) as the star of the Berlin Theatre Festival
(to May 20) and one of the most delightful, inventive, profound and
originally musical musicals composed; a fitting - self-consciously so -
successor to those other mythical English-German concoctions, The Threepenny
Opera and Cabaret.
The Black Rider overlays the modern legend of Burroughs, the Beatnik junkie
who shot his wife, with the old tale of the village clerk who has to pass
muster as marksman before he can marry the gamekeeper's daughter. He makes a
pact in 'silver bullets' with the devil but on his wedding day Satan betrays
him and he shoots dead not the targetted white dove but his wife. This was
the story, converted to a happy ending, of Weber's Der Freischutz. Now
Burroughs, the Texan director and stage designer Robert Wilson, and rock
composer Tom Waits, have reworked the original into a contemporary version.
Other myths get woven in. Wilson's devil is a sleek Master of ceremonies in
whiplash tails who croons the Cabaret welcome 'So come on in/it ain't no
sin/take off your skin/and dance around in your bones'. He introduces the
cast, his 'devil's band', as they step one by one out of a black felt
sentry-box.
For three hours of graceful, cold artifice, they look, act and sound like
figures from the silent movies: movements abrupt, irregular, too fast, too
slow, as if wound up by a shaky hand projector; chalk-white, bony faces,
blackened eye sockets, lips thickened into permanent red pouts. Every image
is ice-hard: hair pulled back crisp or standing up in spikes, clothes
exaggerating bodies with jagged collars, razor pleats, square and
rectangular dresses.
The set continues the theme; Wilson turns children's drawings into
three-dimensional monstrosities. Crooked chairs, two metres high, dangle at
odd angles along with a huge frame whose broken glass juts into the flesh of
its 'living' picture, the gamekeeper's ancestor (Heinz Fossbrink). Pine
trees are scissor cut-outs which collapse and grow again like cartoons,
illuminated sugar pink and lime green against a black forest. Large or small
scale, Wilson is a master of spectacle: the clerk William and his Katchen
floating above the stage for a duet as the great neon sign of a gun descends
before them; the white stockinged leg in red stiletto that appears out of a
slit in the black sentrybox, image of naivety, severity, brittle romance.
Best of all, the whole, the sustained dramatic unity of the vision, is
greater than the sum of its parts. Tom Waits' sarcastic ballads, full of
folk and blues and rock, call back the scarred idealism and mock simplicity
of Kurt Weill, while Burroughs' monosyllabic banality has here found the
setting which makes it seem perfect.
Nursery rhyme humour marries English with German, while Hollywood kitsch
rolls into Teutonic romanticism. Wilson's cast bop and strut and beat out
the mesmeric rhythms in husky tempting voices. The devil (Dominique Horwitz)
has the best tunes, and mocks us for loving them. In 'Last Rose of Summer'
he picks a flower from the floor, affects a tear, disappears into his box
and, inside it, hovers up to the roof of the stage.
Annette Paulmann and Stefan Kurt, as Katchen and William, screech like
vultures and sing like angels. She plays an imaginary piano and draws
patterns in the air as she sings the breathless lyric 'I'll shoot the moon
right out of the sky for you, baby'; he dances a ballet of despair, shock
and loss breaking through his wax face, before rallying with 'I'll be back
on some lucky day'. This production returns to Hamburg's Thalia Theatre
after Berlin, with a stop in Amsterdam on May 14-16. So far plans for a
London visit have not materialised, but this is a show worth a plane ticket.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Technology: The icon gathers a loyal following - As
Microsoft's Windows 3.0 approaches its first birthday, Della Bradshaw
reflects on the software program that took the computer world by storm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Until a year ago, London-based chartered accountants Touche Ross had just
two choices when it wanted to computerise the process of auditing its 1,500
clients.
First Touche could write its own software from scratch - or employ a
contractor to do it - which could prove costly and time-consuming.
Alternatively, Touche could buy a standard software package and try to
adjust the way the firm operated in order to make the auditors' practices
fit the format of the software.
Neither option proved attractive: there was a dearth of readily available
audit support software and the firm was cautious about embarking on a big
software applications drive. Because the bulk of audits are carried out
between November and April - for companies which report their year-ends in
December or March - Touche had to be sure that the software could be
implemented in the slack summer period.
'If we missed that window we were another year away,' relates Mark Stephens,
partner for information technology at Touche. 'Something that took 13 months
to develop was really a two-year programme for us.'
Advised of its imminent arrival, Stephens decided instead to wait for the
Windows 3.0 software program, launched a year ago this month by Microsoft,
the leading US personal computer software company.
The initial success of Windows 3.0 - nearly 3m copies of the program have
been sold worldwide - has been generated because it radically alters how
IBM-compatible personal computers can be used, giving them the look and feel
of an Apple Macintosh.
But more sophisticated users of Windows 3.0, such as Touche, believe its
long-term popularity will be rooted in the ability it gives software
developers to customise their own packages more quickly. 'It takes a third
to a quarter of the time to produce sophisticated software than before,'
says Stephens.
Windows 3.0 is a 'graphical user interface', a program that generates menu
bars, icons and overlapping windows, which can be used with various
applications programs such as word processing or spreadsheets. The interface
enables users to point at symbols and click an electronic 'mouse' to select
functions, instead of typing commands on a keyboard.
What makes Windows 3.0 useful to software developers is that it provides a
'programming environment' which sits on top of the applications package and
enables the procedures within the standard package to be adapted to the
needs of the user organisation. Certain procedures can be ordered in a
different way or eliminated if they are irrelevant.
'In the past we developed word processing packages on the basis of what we
thought users wanted, but you couldn't change them to fit in with the work
pattern that you had in the office,' says David Smith, systems marketing
manager for Microsoft. 'In trying to be general, and develop a package for
every single user in the world, you had to compromise along the way.'
Stephens and his team decided to use Microsoft's Word word-processing
package running under Windows 3.0 as the basis for their development
programme. 'Auditing is a lot about writing but I didn't want to develop a
new word processor. However we couldn't use a standard word processing
package - we needed to tailor it to our specific application,' recalls
Stephens.
So they adapted the Word software, using Windows, to make it look like an
auditing tool. 'From an underlying software standpoint about 95 per cent of
the software is Microsoft. We've done about 5 per cent,' says Stephens. But
he reports that from a user point of view about 80 per cent of software
appears to be a specifically designed for auditing.
The Touche software developers have achieved this by taking all the
word-processing features available in the Word package and linking them
differently. On top of that they have created headings and formats
specifically for their auditors' needs. The progression on standard forms
and layout, for example, mirrors the procedures an auditor would follow in
the course of his job - whether auditing banks or grocery stores.
Although the first software package, launched on 600 machines in August
1990, concentrated on the presentation of the software, this summer
Stephens's department will be adding to the basic features and contributing
to the content of the application. One thing the development team will be
looking at is making the existing software easy to translate - Touche's
Paris office has already shown an interest in going down the same
development route.
Because the development cycles are so short, Touche has even been able to
create several prototype applications and, once appropriate software has
been selected, the rest have been thrown away.
Stephens points out that in spite of the moves towards these programmable
applications packages, the basic applications tools are not completely
ready. Of the five common applications that can be used by most
organisations - word processing, spreadsheet, database, communications and
graphics - Microsoft has developed only two to run under Windows 3.0 -
Excel, the spreadsheet package, and Word. It has also adapted Project, for
project management.
But the success of Windows has persuaded all the large applications software
houses to adapt their most popular packages which run under Dos - the widely
used PC operating system - so that they can take full advantage of Windows.
Lotus, for example, is in the final stages of developing a version of its
popular 1-2-3 spreadsheet package which will fully exploit Windows 3.0, and
is planning to have business graphics for the operating program later this
year, says Robert Ingram, spreadsheet sales and marketing manager for the
company. Borland International has three programming tools which work with
Windows 3.0, and is also adapting its Paradox relational database package
and its Quattro Pro spreadsheet program.
Microsoft estimates that there are now more than 700 software developers
writing new Windows-based applications, all hoping to take a bite of an
ever-growing cherry. The Software Publishers Association in the US estimates
that worldwide sales of Windows 3.0 applications are now second only to
those of Dos applications packages. Market research consultant Dataquest
underlines this optimism: it estimates that by 1992 systems sales of Windows
will have overtaken those of Dos.
The growth in the number of packages to run with Windows 3.0 has changed the
buying patterns of Windows users, says Smith. 'For the first six or seven
months there was an enormous growth in the sales of Windows operating
software. But for the last five months we have seen applications sales shoot
up - sales have quadrupled. Now 85 per cent of Windows users have a Windows
application,' he says.
Initially Windows 3.0 customers were running their existing Dos programs
with the operating system - giving them the advantage of the icon-type
presentation but without the power to move in and out of the applications
provided by Windows 3.0. With Dos programs the user is forced to follow a
series of commands in order to move through the program - like boring a
hole, which you have to climb back out of before you can begin boring
another hole.
The Windows icons enable users to jump between different applications. So
one advantage of combining a Windows application with the Windows 3.0
program, says Smith, is that the user can take text, graphics or numbers
from one applications package and transfer them into another - figures from
a spreadsheet program can be copied into a report being prepared in a word
processing package, say.
Perhaps the biggest advantage is that the two application packages need not
even be provided by the same software companies.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Delors overture fails to unite
Conservatives - European Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Commission suggestions for compromise on economic and monetary
union showed little sign yesterday of uniting the Conservatives on Europe -
or of tapping undiscovered goodwill among Tory MPs to Mr Jacques Delors, the
commission's president.
Suggestions at the weekend that Britain be allowed to sign a treaty without
agreeing on the final goals did nothing to alter the well-rehearsed
convictions of Tories at Westminster.
The anti-federalists, with the Bruges Group in the vanguard, remained
opposed to any deal by which Britain would accept, even tacitly, a single
currency. The most 'pro-Europe' Tories were anxious for Britain to react
positively.
Those in the middle remained sceptical of Mr Delors' vision for Europe and
anxious to avoid being 'bounced' into a treaty the UK might regret. Not even
an opportunity to defer awkward decisions beyond the election swayed
firmly-entrenched views. Words of encouragement were qualified by warnings
that the small print had to be examined carefully.
The government's reaction was also cautious. If a decision was to be
deferred for a future parliament, all options had to be kept open. The 'hard
Ecu' remained on the table. But officials admitted the European Commission
had at least show 'an appreciation of the UK's concerns'.
For some MPs who strongly opposed a single European currency, Mr Delors'
suggestion was acceptable only if it was clear Britain was defering the
decision on whether to accept such a move - not just the timing. And there
was no deadline for a decision.
One right-wing minister said: 'If we can dither indefinitely, it's fine. If
there is a cut-off point to the dithering, it's a fraud,'
Mr Patrick Robertson, secretary of the Bruges Group, said: 'Any compromise
which makes Britain accept a single European currency in principle would be
completely unacceptable. At present there is not enough information anywhere
to be clear exactly what the form of words would be.'
Mr Teddy Taylor, secretary of the European Reform Group, went as far as
saying: 'If the government could negotiate an arrangement 'without
commitment' we feel that this would be a very major advance in the battle to
preserve our freedom and to safeguard the nation against socialist control
and bureaucracy.'
But Mr William Cash, the prominent anti-Federal Europe MP for Stafford, said
it was 'unrealistic' to expect what amounted to a two-tier Europe to work in
practice.
Among the middle ground of the party, there was anxiety, to be seen as
pro-European, like Mr John Major. But there was suspicion about Mr Delors'
blueprint for Emu. Mr Terence Higgins, chairman of the Commons' Treasury
select committee, said Mr Delors, 'thinks he is losing the argument' and so
was trying to get British agreement for allowing other EC members to proceed
on a pre-determined timetable.
For most on the pro-European wing, however, the plan was another opportunity
the UK appeared set to rebuff. Mr Hugh Dykes, MP for Harrow East, said: 'How
crazy it is that even when the commission president proposes a helpful
compromise, meeting specific British hesitations, it is denounced by a small
number of hysterical anti-marketeers.'

<TEXT>
A SUGGESTION that all new civil servants should be issued with a copy of Sir
Bernard Ingham's memoirs to learn how to 'stitch up elected ministers at the
request of the prime minister' was greeted with derision yesterday by Mr Tim
Renton, the Civil Service minister.
Mr Tony Banks, (Lab, Newham NW), had said Kill the Messenger, Sir Bernard's
account of 11 years as Mrs Margaret Thatcher's press secretary, would make
an effective teaching aid at the Civil Service College.
Earlier Mr Renton rejected a call by Mr Max Madden (Lab Bradford West) for a
new inquiry into the Westland affair.
In his book Sir Bernard denies that he authorised a leak from the department
of trade and industry of a letter from Sir Patrick Mayhew, the then
Solicitor General, referring to Mr Michael Heseltine's conduct throughout
the affair.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Politicians play fast and loose
with the numbers / Testing the validity of arguments in the current debate
on taxes and public spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN politicians begin to argue about the relative merits of lower taxes or
higher public spending it is time for the voters to beware. When the debate
takes place in the approach to a general election and becomes enmeshed in
the detail of supposedly incontrovertible arithmetic the most sensible
course for the uncommitted is to suspend belief.
The real political - and economic - arguments behind the relative stances of
the Tories and Labour party in the past week have been drowned in a sea of
irreconcilable and often spurious statistics.
At one level there is no fundamental disagreement between the parties that
if the economy grows and tax rates remain constant, the government will reap
a 'growth dividend'. It can spend it in one of three ways, or in any
combination of the three: to reduce borrowing, to increase spending, and to
reduce tax rates.
The Conservative policy is based on delivering a combination of all three.
It says it will continue to provide real increases in resources for the
public sector, will move towards a balanced budget, and will find room to
cut the basic rate of income tax.
Labour has said it will use the dividend to boost spending and it will
definitely not cut tax rates. It has been silent on whether it would reduce
borrowing or keep it at present levels.
Its only costed spending commitments - to increase child benefit and raise
state pensions - will be financed separately by abolishing the ceiling on
employees National Insurance Contributions and by increasing the top rate of
income tax to 50p from 40p.
But if that sounds a relatively straightforward choice as between Labour and
the Conservatives, a dispassionate observer of the claims and counterclaims
flung across the party divide in recent days could draw only one conclusion:
our political masters canp. There have been many examples, but one or two
give some of the flavour.
In the middle of last week Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, declared that
on the basis of growth of 2.5 per cent a year his party could expect a
'dividend' of about Pounds 20bn to devote to public services over the
lifetime of a parliament. The Conservatives seized on the figure as a
'gaff'. Their own spending plans already included provision for an extra
Pounds 26bn in the next three years. If Labour was to spend Pounds 20bn more
it would have to raise taxes.
It was a credible, if contentious point but the Conservatives then spoilt
the case with their own arithmetic.
Their charge was that Labour would have to raise the basic rate of income
tax by 2p each and every year for the lifetime of a parliament, pushing the
basic rate of income tax to 35p. They omitted to mention that this would
raise not Pounds 20bn but Pounds 60bn. The message yesterday was that Mr
John Major, who first used the 10p figure, had made the 'reasonable'
assumption that Mr Kinnock had been talking about Pounds 20bn a year in
extra spending by the end of a parliament.
Labour meanwhile has been busy making its own assumptions about the
Conservatives' plans. The strategy behind its weekend charge that Mr Major
had a hidden agenda to raise Value Added Tax from 17.5 per cent to 22 per
cent in order to finance cuts in the basic rate of income tax was clear.
The government has raised VAT twice since 1979 to finance reductions in
income tax and, more recently, to reduce poll tax bills. Since its own
figures showed there was no room in the next three years to reduce the basic
rate of income tax, Labour felt able to claim that it was obvious VAT would
rise again.
Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, was careful, however, not to mention
any of the caveats with which Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has
circumscribed the income tax commitment. A rise in VAT of 4.5 per cent would
raise Pounds 8bn a year, enough to cut 4p off the basic rate of tax in the
first budget of a new Conservative government.
Mr Lamont has stressed, however, that he plans to move towards his target at
an altogether more sedate pace.
Even if the politicians did not misinterpret their opponents' intentions,
the apparent precision of their figures bestows a spurious accuracy on
economic forecasts stretching five years ahead. The Treasury has shown in
the past few years that it is dangerous to trust predictions stretching just
12 months ahead.
The debate of the last few days does tell the voter that taxes are likely to
be lower under the Conservatives and public spending higher under Labour.
Beyond that the forecasts are perhaps best regarded with the same confidence
as the average horoscope.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Plea for white collar jobless -
Unemployment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS speculation about the date of the general election continued in the
Commons last night Sir Robert McCrindle, a senior Conservative backbencher,
called on the government to pay closer attention to the growth in 'white
collar' unemployment.
He stressed that it was a 'phenomenon' of the current recession which was
affecting voters in his Brentwood and Ongar constituency and others within
commuting distance who looked to the City of London for employment .
Labour MPs predicted that their party was poised to win the Monmouth
by-election on Thursday and that, as a result, Mr John Major, the prime
minister, would avoid calling a general election before October at the
earliest.
Mr John MacGregor, leader of the Commons, declined to comment on the timing
of the general election but reaffirmed the government's determination to
make Labour's spending commitments - and the implications for increased
taxation - a key feature of the campaign.
Sir Robert McCrindle accepted that priority had to be accorded to getting
inflation down but urged the government to spread the coverage of its
advertising campaign on unemployment to cover the services sector as well as
manufacturing industry.
While the 1980s had been characterised as the period of the 'yuppies' and,
perhaps, 'the unacceptable face of the City of London' the latest downturn
in the economy had changed the situation.
Sir Robert estimated that about 40 per cent of the current rise in
unemployment, and about half the company liquidations, were in the 'services
dominated' south east of England.
MPs approved a motion authoring the House to adjourn from May 23 to June 3
for the spring recess.

THE Ministry of Defence is organising a 'major audit effort' to prevent
fraud in the shipping of military equipment back from the Gulf, the Commons
Public Accounts Committee was told yesterday.
Sir Michael Quinlan, permanent under-secretary at the Ministry, said the aim
was to ensure it was returned 'in a properly accounted manner'.
His assurance followed a five-fold rise to Pounds 1.2m. in the amount
involved in alleged fraud at defence establishments in the last financial
year, compared with a total of just over Pounds 2m in the previous six
years.
He admitted he was surprised at the low proportion of people who were
dismissed or resigned as a result.

FT  14 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Unions seek advice on R-R jobs move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNION LEADERS were yest-erday seeking legal advice over a decision by
Rolls-Royce to terminate the contracts of its 34,000 aerospace workers in
order to implement a pay freeze.
The move - claimed by some unions to be mass sackings, if only on a
temporary basis - is one of the most significant attempts by a company to
change its employees' contracts during the recession.
Rolls-Royce said the move was nothing more than a legal technicality, and
that employees would be offered contracts on broadly similar terms. It added
that it had no wish to see people dismiss themselves as a result of its
decision.
Mr Tim Webb, national officer of the MSF general technical union, said the
company had 'imposed a six-month wage freeze without consultation or
warning'.
Rolls-Royce announced the pay freeze last week at the same time as unveiling
plans to double job losses in the aerospace division this year to 6,000.
In a subsequent letter to employees, sent at the end of last week, the
company gave notice that contracts would be terminated at various stages,
depending on length of service, from last Saturday. New conditions would be
exactly the same as existing ones except that pay would be frozen.
Mr Webb said unions were worried the company was planning other changes to
working practices, including the introduction of individual contracts.
Few other companies among the increasing numbers of employers announcing pay
freezes have terminated existing contracts. However, Mr D'Arcy Payne,
personnel director in Rolls-Royce's aerospace division, said that the
company had taken careful legal advice before making its decision.
Under the pay freeze, increments to reward length of service will be
suspended. In addition, there will be no general pay rises for at least six
months.
Leaders of the manual workers' union will meet on Thursday to discuss the
job losses and the pay freeze, and union officials are also asking for a
meeting with the Rolls-Royce board.

FT  14 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Post Office staff vote for strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COUNTER and clerical staff employed by the Post Office have voted to strike
over a 6.8 per cent pay offer. The Union of Communication Workers, the main
Post Office union, last night called for the urgent resumption of talks in
an attempt to have the offer increased.
The ballot result was announced yesterday at the UCW's conference in
Blackpool. Mr Alan Tuffin, UCW general secretary, agreed last night that the
result was some way from the overwhelming majority that union negotiators
had sought.
In a 67 per cent turnout for the ballot, 4,613 UCW members voted for
industrial action, while 3,732 voted against.
A total of 14,500 counter and clerical staff are employed by the Post Office
Counters business, which is separate from mail sorting and delivery service.
Mr Tuffin said that he would have liked more members to have taken part in
the ballot. However, the result, which had come from what was traditionally
a non-militant section of the union, indicated the strength of feeling among
the membership.
A number of options for action remained open, said Mr Tuffin. Workers in
cities such as London, Glasgow, Liverpool and Manchester were likely to have
voted most heavily for a strike, and it was possible there could be
selective action. He added that Post Office Counters management had been
asked to travel to Blackpool, where the union's conference continues for the
rest of the week, so that talks could re-open without delay.
Post Office Counters said last night that it was clear the union's executive
did not have an overwhelming mandate for strike action and it hoped that the
pay offer would now be quickly agreed.

freeze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
USDAW, the shop workers union, will this week attempt to persuade Harrods,
the London department store, to lift a six-month pay freeze for its 4,000
employees.
The Knightsbridge store, which has been encountering difficult trading
conditions because of a drop in tourist numbers after the Gulf war, has told
staff it will review the pay freeze, which started on April 1, in the
autumn.
Harrods, owned by House of Fraser, had offered its non-managerial staff a 3
per cent increase from April 1 with a further 2 per cent in October.
Usdaw, which will be meeting senior representatives of Harrods on Thursday
to ask them to re-open pay negotiations, said the offer was withdrawn on
Friday and a pay freeze announced. Last month Harrods told all its 600
managerial staff that their pay was being frozen.
Pay freezes have been adopted by a significant number of employers this year
but Laura Ashley Holdings, the fashion and household retailer, was so far
believed to be the only high-street retailer among them. Pay awards in the
retail sector have been averaging about 9 per cent to 10 per cent although
members of the Multiple Shoe Retailers' Association restricted pay rises for
19-to-21-year-olds to 5 per cent.
Earlier this year Harrods shed 200 staff. The redundancy programme was to
have been larger, but was trimmed after staff protests. It was prompted by
poor trading conditions in February.

FT  14 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): TUC finds few deals on recognition at
new plants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIONS appear to have found it increasingly difficult in the past three
years to gain recognition agreements from inward investors and British
companies setting up new plants, a senior TUC official said yesterday.
Mr John Monks, TUC deputy general secretary, said only 10 deals had been
notified to the TUC since October 1988 under a procedure to regulate
inter-union conflict of the kind which led to the expulsion of the EETPU
electricians' union.
Under the prior-notification procedure, which was made permanent in June
last year, unions should tell the TUC about any single-union deal they are
about to sign.
Mr Monks told a conference in London that the number of deals was 'very
small' compared with the rush of agreements signed in the mid-1980s.
He added that the TUC might support establishing the size of union
membership in a company by a workforce ballot instead of a petition drawn up
by a union, saying this method might be 'politically advisable' in order to
gain public support for TUC proposals.

FT  14 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Non-managerial staff reject 5% Midland
offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIDLAND BANK, the last of the big four clearing banks to enter pay
negotiations this year, has offered its 35,000 non-managerial staff a rise
of 5 per cent from June 1.
The offer was rejected by union negotiators and both sides will meet again
at the end of the week. Only a small improvement is expected on the offer,
and it is likely that the final settlement will fall at the lower end of
this year's likely 5-7 1/2 per cent range of pay increases for the clearers.
Midland's poor financial performance led it to halve its dividend earlier
this year.
Pressure on Midland's management to increase the offer will be reduced to
some extent by the June settlement date and what is expected to be a
continuing drop in inflation before then. The other main clearing banks' pay
increases take effect from February and April.
Mr Ed Sweeney, deputy general secretary elect of the Banking, Insurance and
Finance Union, said that Midland's negotiators had also drawn attention to
an offer of 5 per cent by Lloyds Bank to its 46,000 non-managerial staff.
Lloyds has said there is no further room for improvement on the offer,
although more talks are due to take place today.
Barclays' staff have already settled for a rise of more than 7 per cent and
NatWest has implemented a 7.5 per cent rise as part of a deal that will
allow the bank to require more flexible starting times from its employees.
Unions and management at TSB are also due to meet again at the end of the
week following an increase in the pay offer to staff from 6.75 per cent to 7
per cent.
Bifu members are being balloted on industrial action at Lombard North
Central. The National Union of Mineworkers has offered to back a recognition
claim by the banking union Bifu at the North of England Building Society by
urging NUM members to withdraw their savings from the society. Bifu has not
taken up the offer 'for the moment', it said, because the move could
threaten the livelihood of its members.

companies. It decided to push its proposal forward only when Mr Norman
Lamont, the chancellor, called for ideas on widening share ownership.
The London Stock Exchange was always going to pour cold water on the concept
of a rival market for small companies. Yesterday its chairman, Mr Andrew
Hugh Smith, could not resist asking just how NatWest thought it could find
buyers for shares in tiny businesses.
As he sees it, it is one thing to buy shares from Mrs Brown in Newcastle but
it is another to sell them to Mr Jones in Truro. Just who wants shares in
penny-halfpenny companies? As far as the stock exchange is concerned, there
is no way of answering the question, which is why there is no rival market.
NatWest disagrees. It believes there are two possible solutions: it could
establish a group of independent agents tied to NatWest, specialising in
small companies and buying shares from individual investors; or it could
link with a third party acting as a broker marketing shares acquired by
NatWest.
Since the demise of the Third Market at the end of last year, the bank's
stockbrokers have been convinced that they could offer those companies a new
home.
It also believes it could pick up unlisted businesses, which typically have
1m shares at Pounds 1 each, as well as some of the smaller companies quoted
on the Unlisted Securities Market.
The USM was set up on November 10 1980 to provide a separately regulated and
more flexible market for smaller companies.
NatWest believes it could offer many of the smaller USM-quoted companies
easier access to the public at an earlier stage of their development.
NatWest established a share dealing service in December 1986, for the
privatisation of British Gas and it has been thinking of ways of developing
its service.
In January 1988 it extended its touch-screen share-dealing operation
throughout the country. In 278 of the bank's 2,900 branches, investors can
buy or sell shares in 550 companies.
In spite of the operation's initial success, the branches do an average of
only 10 deals a day each.
Mr Neil Stapley, managing director of NatWest Stockbrokers, assigned a
project team to look at ways to extend that service. The team calculated
that a market for small companies would be relatively cheap to establish.
When the Treasury issued a press release in March asking for ideas to sell
the shares it owns in BT, NatWest Stockbrokers seized on a supplementary
question. The chancellor wanted to know how high-street share shops could
develop throughout the country - he was not interested just in the BT sale
but in widening share ownership generally.
That was good enough for NatWest. It is relying on the Treasury to keep to
its side of the deal and will come up with the ideas if Whitehall throws its
weight behind them in the face of stock exchange hostility.
To be fair to Mr Hugh Smith, he has made it clear that the bank is in an
ideal situation to establish a market in small shares. If it decides to set
up a rival market, Mr Hugh Smith does not think it should necessarily be
judged as a challenge to the exchange. Others are not so sure.
Mr Brian Winterflood, managing director of Winterflood Securities, which
offers a share service in 830 small companies, said NatWest had
'state-of-the-art' technology to offer a first-rate market for small
companies.
'It has the capability to challenge the stock exchange,' he said.

FT  14 MAY 91 / New truck sales down by 46%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW TRUCK sales plunged in April by 46 per cent, compared with the same
month last year, to only 2,647, as the recession deepened further in leading
sectors of the UK commercial vehicles market.
The truck industry is suffering the steepest two-year slide into recession
in the post-war period, with most UK truck makers operating at a loss.
Truck registrations (above 3.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight) in the first
four months - at 11,562 - were 39.7 per cent lower than a year ago,
according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.
Sales have dropped by 54.9 per cent in the past two years from the 25,638
achieved in the first four months of 1989.
The collapse in sales has been led by the heavy truck sector (above 15
tonnes), where sales in the first four months this year - at 5,452 - were
43.4 per cent lower than a year ago and 61.6 per cent lower than in the
corresponding period of 1989.
Overall, new commercial vehicle registrations in April fell by 27.6 per cent
to 19,406, compared with the same month last year, while sales in the first
four months were 31.6 per cent lower than a year ago, at 79,457. Sales of
imported vehicles have been hardest hit in the recession, and their share in
the first four months fell to 35.6 per cent from 39.5 per cent a year ago.
In the truck market Leyland DAF, UK subsidiary of DAF of the Netherlands,
established a narrow lead in the first four months ahead of Iveco Ford.
Leyland DAF increased its share of the overall truck market (above 3.5
tonnes) to 24.5 per cent from 24 per cent a year ago, while Iveco Ford's
share dropped to 24.2 per cent from 24.9 per cent in the corresponding
period a year ago.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Cardiff hospitals may lose 200 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME 200 jobs are likely to be lost in Cardiff hospitals as a result of the
decision of South Glamorgan Health Authority to privatise its cleaning
services, writes Anthony Moreton.
The authority says the move will lead to a saving of 'just under Pounds 1m,
which will be ploughed back into patient services'.
The authority, which has responsibility for the University of Wales teaching
hospital as well as the city's Royal Infirmary, has followed government
policy by opening up cleaning services to the private sector.
The service companies estimate they will need about 800 of the present 1,000
staff.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Brooke hopeful on reviving Irish talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and Our Belfast Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER BROOKE, North-ern Ireland secretary, last night appeared hopeful
that he could resuscitate talks on the province's political future. But he
admitted that time was not on his side.
After a fourth day of talks in Belfast with Unionist and nationalist leaders
about the venue for talks involving the Irish government, Mr Brooke
suggested he was making some headway in reaching a compromise. 'Serious
business is being done,' he said.
However, Mr Brooke was careful not to raise hopes after what has proved an
acrimonious debate over the location for talks on relations between north
and south Ireland. 'I don't think time is on our side,' he admitted, adding:
'I don't want to get overexcited.'
The row has dominated the first two weeks out of the 11 set aside for the
talks. At this stage the participants were supposed to be discussing
devolved government in the province. Mr Brooke will meet Unionist leaders
and the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party again today at
Stormont parliament buildings outside Belfast.
An incident yesterday which highlighted the cost of failure was the murder
by the IRA of Mr Robert Orr, a businessman and member of the loyalist Orange
Order. A bomb exploded under his car as he waited at lights in Armagh.
Mr Brooke appears to have stopped short of issuing an ultimatum over a venue
with the threat of ending the talks if agreement cannot be reached. He is
understood to be working on variations of a proposal for holding talks with
the Irish government first in London, then Belfast, then Dublin.
Unionists insist they cannot hold talks with Dublin ministers anywhere in
Ireland while the Republic's constitutional claim on Northern Ireland
remains. The SDLP believes meetings should rotate between London, Dublin and
Belfast.

FT  14 MAY 91 / The Blue Arrow Trial: Paper to NatWest board was rewritten,
jury is told
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PAPER on County NatWest's handling of the parcels of Blue Arrow shares
taken by advisers to the September 1987 rights issue was rewritten within
the parent bank to make it 'softer and vaguer' before being presented to the
NatWest board, the Blue Arrow trial heard yesterday.
The purpose of the re-drafting was to put the paper into a form that could
be considered by the board, which included non-executive directors, Mr
Leslie Collett, former secretary to the County chairman's committee, agreed
with Mr Alun Jones QC.
Changes made while the paper was in the office of Mr Thomas Frost, the
NatWest group chief executive, had the effect of making the problems facing
County after the stock market crash seem much less urgent, Mr Jones, for Mr
Stephen Clark, a County director, said.
Mr Collett agreed with him that the changes had made the paper softer and
vaguer, and made it appear that the discussions over the future of the
holdings were not too far advanced.
Although the paper finally presented to the NatWest board on December 8 was
signed by Mr Jonathan Cohen, the former County chief executive, it had been
very carefully rewritten 'at the behest' of people at NatWest, including Mr
Frost and Mr Terence Green, the former NWB deputy chief executive, he
agreed.
Between November 23, when a number of County executives met to discuss the
holding, and December 8 1987, a strategic planning department within the
parent bank was involved in the redrafting of the paper, he said.
Mr Collett also agreed that the legal advice given at the meeting on
November 23 by Mr Alan Keat, a defendant, and Mr Nigel Campion-Smith,
solicitors from Travers Smith Braithwaite, was that no immediate disclosure
of the holdings was necessary.
He was questioned later by Mr Anthony Hooper QC, for Mr David Reed, a former
County director, over the legal advice given by Mr Campion-Smith at a
meeting held on September 23, before the issue closed, at which County's
possible buying of shares was discussed.
'Mr Campion-Smith didn't say 'Watch it, that is a conspiracy to defraud if
you do what we have discussed'?' Mr Hooper asked.
Mr Collett replied: 'I don't think he said anything akin to it at all.'
County NatWest, NatWest Investment Bank, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew Securities and
seven individuals, including Mr Clark, Mr Cohen, Mr Keat and Mr Reed, deny
conspiring to mislead the markets over the outcome of the Pounds 837m issue.
The trial continues today.

FT  14 MAY 91 / City regulators angry over Taurus decision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government's decision to hand regulatory responsibility for Taurus, the
stock market's planned settlement system, to the stock exchange was greeted
with barely concealed anger in some City regulatory circles yesterday.
Mr John Redwood, corporate affairs minister, has decided not to give the
task to the existing investment watchdogs for fear of adding to the
bureaucracy created by the Financial Services Act.
Yet some investment regulators argue that giving the job to the exchange,
with the Department of Trade and Industry retaining overall responsibility,
will lead to conflicts between regulatory agencies, and will expose
'horrendous' conflicts of interest within the exchange.
It will mean that both the exchange and the existing self-regulating
organisations will be responsible for assessing whether an investment firm
is 'fit and proper' to operate. Differences of opinion could cause problems,
one senior regulator said privately yesterday.
'We all feel it won't work. It will fall down where there is a difference of
opinion,' he said.
A further difficulty, he said, was that the exchange would act as regulator
and commercial operator of Taurus. This would create conflicts of interest,
as it would be forced at times to discipline investment firms that were in
fact among its biggest customers.
Mr Redwood's decision, conveyed to regulators last Friday, is due to be
announced formally on Thursday when the DTI publishes its long-awaited legal
regulations paving the way for Taurus.
At the same time, he will announce an annual ceiling for the Taurus
compensation scheme of Pounds 100m - far less than the Pounds 1bn he had
urged earlier, but more than the Pounds 50m originally proposed by the
exchange.
The launch of Taurus - probably in about a year - will create an important
regulatory task. The many brokers, custodians, registrars and others linked
electronically to the system will need to be assessed on their technical
expertise and their fitness and properness, as well as their capital
adequacy. Giving this job to the existing investment regulators would have
brought registrars, custodians and nominees within the scope of the FSA -
something that the DTI, already recoiling from the over-complexity of the
existing regulatory structure, was not willing to do.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Nissan wins first round in fight with importer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NISSAN MOTOR of Japan won an initial victory yesterday in its High Court
battle with Nissan UK, its privately-owned importer, by persuading the court
to hear at least the first part of the action behind closed doors.
Nissan Motor, Japan's second-largest car maker, is trying to avoid an
embarrassing open confrontation in the English courts by having its dispute
with Nissan UK referred to arbitration in Japan.
It argues that under the terms of the original distribution agreement, which
came into effect at the beginning of 1971, any disputes or legal proceedings
were to be settled in Japan.
Sir Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson, the vice-chancellor, agreed to Nissan Motor's
request that the issue of jurisdiction over the dispute should be heard in
chambers.
He said his judgment would probably be given in open court, and the second
part of the action - Nissan UK's attempt to win an injunction preventing
Nissan Motor from selling vehicles to any other distributor - would be heard
in open court.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Labour rules out drastic reform for accountancy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LABOUR party is unlikely to seek immediate and drastic reforms of the
UK's accountancy profession if it wins the next election, the party's
discussion paper on its plans for accountants and auditors made clear.
In the paper, Ms Marjorie Mowlam, opposition City spokesman, states that the
current regulatory regime, whereby auditors are to be monitored by the
professional bodies under the Companies Act 1989, is unsatisfactory.
But the remedies put forward in the document fall far short of those being
expounded by Mr Austin Mitchell, Labour MP for Great Grimsby and a former
frontbench spokesman, who has attacked the accounting status quo.
Yesterday's document shows that Labour has no immediate plans to curtail the
consultancy work done by firms of auditors for their audit clients, or to
insist on the rotation of auditors after a fixed period. These are among the
more radical reforms advocated by Mr Mitchell.
The document welcomes the recent improvements to the way in which accounting
standards are set and monitored. It suggests that similar improvements ought
to be made to the regulation of auditors.
'There is no doubt that the current institutional arrangements are
unsatisfactory,' the document says. 'There is a need for (more input from
outside the profession) and generally greater transparency of proceedings
and recommendations.'
The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England &amp; Wales yesterday
challenged the view of Sir Gordon Borrie, director-general of fair trading,
that the proposed regulations restricting non-auditors to ownership or
control of no more than 25 per cent of auditing firms are uncompetitive. The
institute told Mr John Redwood, corporate affairs minister, that the
restriction was essential to safeguard auditors' independence.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Small companies may lose in EC public deals race
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER, Industrial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMALL AND medium-sized British companies are in danger of losing out to
Continental competitors as the market for public procurement opens up in the
next few years. This was the warning yesterday from Sir John Cuckney,
chairman of a National Economic Development Council working party on open
public procurement in the European Community.
Sir John, chairman of 3i, the venture-capital investment group owned by the
Bank of England and the clearing banks, said small and medium-sized
companies were in danger of sticking their heads in the sand just as their
public-sector markets were about to undergo a huge transition.
He was speaking at the launch of a working party to examine the likely
impact of open public procurement on British companies over the next 18
months.
Under the single-market programme the EC is issuing a series of directives
designed to eliminate barriers to cross-border trade in public services.
Public procurement in the EC is worth about Pounds 430bn a year.
The working party is the first NEDC body to include representatives from the
Continent: Mr Bernado Cremades, a leading Spanish lawyer; Mr Bernard
Gosselin, the secretary-general responsible for public purchasing at the
French ministry of economy and finance; Mr Preben Jackobsen, director of the
Danish directorate for state purchasing; and Peter Prince Wittgenstein a
member of the executive board of German engineering group Mannesmann.
The working group plans to examine the market for public-sector building and
infrastructure projects including their design, local authority public
purchasing, markets to supply health authorities in the EC, and the supply
of services in general.
Among other things, the working party will study whether there are unfair
barriers to British companies bidding for contracts on the Continent.
Sir John said the working party would be just as concerned with the outlook
for large companies as for small ones, and added: 'It will take some time
before groups either gain the economies of scale or the specialisation to
move into exports outside the EC.'
The working party plans to issue British companies with practical guidance
on how to bid for public-sector contracts on the continent.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Fiscal studies institute backs local income tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LOCAL TAX based on property values is backed as the best short-term
replacement for the poll tax in an independent report published yesterday.
But the report, from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, advocates the
introduction of a local income tax in the longer term to raise additional
revenue.
The report emphasises that what matters more than the method of raising
finance is that whatever is chosen should be sustainable and able to survive
changes in national government.
The institute says that the economic case for a property tax, as now
advocated by both the government and the Labour party, is strong because
property enjoys substantial fiscal privileges in the UK and should bear its
share of taxation.
On valuation, Mr Michael Ridge and Mr Stephen Smith of the IFS, who wrote
the report, prefer the use of capital values as favoured by the government
rather than rental values. But they are unconvinced of the need for
'banding' categories of property by value.
'We see no great merit in rough and ready forms of valuation (numbers of
rooms etc.) nor in banding,' they say. 'Both are likely to lead to more
perceived inequity in the treatment of similar properties than with a
conventional capital valuation; banding in particular seems unlikely to
promise much saving in valuation and administration costs, since the tax
implications of being placed in one band rather than another are likely to
provoke taxpayers to contest the valuation in borderline cases.'
The advantage of a local income tax, which is advocated by the Liberal
Democrats, is that it could raise more revenue than is now raised from local
taxation. That could be important, as funding a high proportion of local
government from central grants has often been seen as a source of
instability in council finances.
There would be a problem of timing, however. A property tax could be
introduced quickly - the government is aiming at April 1993 - whereas any
form of local income tax would require a much longer timescale.
'In the longer term, however, if it is intended that local taxes should
contribute more to the costs of local government, we see no alternative to
the eventual introduction of a local income tax, either as a supplement to,
or replacing, property taxation,' the authors state.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Plans to aid low-cost housing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HUNT, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANNING arrangements are to be made more flexible to encourage builders to
provide a greater number of low-cost homes.
But planning minister Sir George Young, announcing the changes, said he had
rejected the idea that local authorities should have the power to insist on
a fixed quota of cheaper homes when they grant planning permission.
This has disappointed conservationists, who would like to see councils given
mandatory powers to make developers provide a proportion of cheaper houses
and flats in new developments.
'It is a missed opportunity,' said Mr Tony Burton, planning officer for the
Council for the Protection of Rural England. 'It has not given the local
authorities the powers they need to be effective.'
The scheme mainly applies to rural areas where the influx of well-paid house
purchasers from urban areas has sent prices up beyond the reach of local
people.
Sir George is asking local authorities to negotiate with developers to
include a proportion of low-cost housing.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Brokers find Scots power promising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TWO Scottish electricity companies are more attractive to investors than
the privatised English generators and regional electricity companies,
according to Credit Lyonnais Laing, the stockbroker. The Scottish companies
are due to be floated on May 30.
The comment came in the first brokers' circular to be produced since the
government published the pathfinder prospectus for ScottishPower and
Scottish Hydro-Electric last week. Laing believes the two Scottish companies
have good prospects for profits growth in the generating side of their
businesses, which accounts for 30 per cent of ScottishPower's profits and 55
per cent of those of Hydro-Electric.
The companies will be able to increase their earnings from generation as the
transmission interconnector, which links the Scottish grid to the national
grid in England and Wales, is expanded by 1994.
The analysts point out that the Scottish companies will have an 'enduring
advantage' over other generators because the Miller field in the North Sea
will start producing cheap gas next year, and the benefits will be shared by
both companies. Hydro-Electric also have another advantage only partly
shared with ScottishPower because of its low-cost hydro-electric capacity.
A further advantage is that after 1994, when customers using between 1MW and
10MW may choose suppliers, tariffs in Scotland are set to move only
gradually into line with pool prices rather than instantly, as in England.
But the Laing analysts, Mr Robert Giles and Mr Arthur Hepher, point out that
the Scottish companies can expect lower real earnings growth in distribution
and transmission because the government has set them harsher X-factors.
Those require them to increase their tariffs by less than the rise in the
retail prices index. The regional electricity companies are allowed to
exceed the rise.
The analysts believe the market may prefer Hydro-Electric because of its
vigorous management and success in winning new business.
They believe the two Scottish companies should justify a lower yield than
the current average of 5.2 per cent for the English generators. But they
expect the government to float them on a 5.2 per cent yield in order to
produce a 20p premium on the part-paid price of Pounds 1. With the premium
they would yield 4.8 per cent after flotation.

SURVEILLANCE equipment is to be installed at main railway stations as soon
as possible to guard against terrorist bomb attacks, Mr Desmond O'Brien,
chief constable of British Transport Police, said yesterday.
Mr O'Brien was speaking at a London news conference at which the force's
1990-91 annual report was published. It showed a 3.6 per cent reduction in
crime on Britain's railways. Violent crime on BR and the London Underground
dropped 31.6 per cent compared with 1989; sex attacks were down by 15.1 per
cent.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Brewers urge easing of pub age law

THE BREWERS' Society yesterday called on the government to allow pubs in
England and Wales to employ 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds and to admit
children under 14 for family meals.
The proposals were part of a submission on the licensing laws sent to Mr
Peter Lloyd, a junior Home Office minister. Such moves 'would allow the
consumer greater choice and offer increased opportunities for the licensed
trade over the next decade', the society said.
It said the ban on employment of young people prevented the recruitment of
good-quality employees and the development of career paths for new
licensees.
The society recognised that strict controls would be required. It suggested
that young staff should be registered with local Training and Enterprise
Councils and should be under the direct supervision of licensees.
Pubs in England and Wales, like those in Scotland, should be able to apply
to licensing justices for children's certificates allowing under-14s in bars
until 8pm for meals with an accompanying adult, the society suggested.

FT  14 MAY 91 / BR given go-ahead for extra carriages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH RAIL has received government permission to order extra carriages
worth Pounds 67.3m for the commuter trains shortly to start operating
between London and north-west Kent.
The decision will come as a relief to BR and its passengers because a heavy
overshoot in the corporation's budget for the past financial year has placed
many of its investment plans in jeopardy.
The order approved yesterday is for 43 two-car Networker trains similar to
the 100 four-car Networkers already ordered for the inner Kent suburban
lines.
The four-car trains being built by BREL, the former engineering arm of BR,
and GEC Alsthom, the Anglo-French engineering group, will make up eight-car
formations which will start replacing the 40-year-old slam-door trains on
these routes in May next year.
The trains being replaced are the same as that involved in London's Cannon
Street rail crash in January, which killed two people and injured more than
250.
When the two-car trains start being delivered in 1993, they will be added to
the eight-car trains to make up 10-car formations. BR hopes eventually to
convert these trains to 12-car formations to cope with continuing traffic
growth.
BR had earlier hoped to win approval for new trains for the longer-distance
Kent Coast routes, but these had to be dropped from the investment programme
because of the corporation's financial crisis.

<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA yesterday rejected EC claims that it would be forced to tone down
its campaign in Gatt's Uruguay Round for free trade in agricultural
products, Kevin Brown reports from Sydney. Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture
commissioner, had suggested Australia would be forced to soften its stance
under pressure for subsidies from farmers hit by recession and falling world
prices.
Mr Neal Blewett, trade negotiations minister, said Mr MacSharry's remarks
were 'discouraging and inaccurate', and claimed Australia was resisting
pressure for subsidies. The EC should emulate Australia's 'political
courage' by moving away from export subsidies to farmers, he told
parliament. Australia chairs the Cairns Group of farm exporting nations,
which has pushed strongly for extending trade liberalisation to food
products.
Australia's refusal to aid wheat growers, partly from fear of weakening its
Gatt negotiating stance, has been attacked by its farming groups, which say
planting for next year's crop could be cut 35 per cent. But Canberra has
approved a ADollars 100m (Pounds 45m) rise in the Grains Council of
Australia's borrowing limit, to allow advance payments to growers, and has
expanded its Rural Adjustment Scheme, to help farmers cope.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Wage discord in Argentine military fuels unrest fears
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DISCONTENT in Argentina's armed forces over low pay and declining budgets
has raised new fears of military unrest, five months after the government
crushed the fourth mutiny since the restoration of democracy in 1983.
The commanders of the army, air force and navy met yesterday to analyse each
service's financial problems. The meetings are intended to put pressure on
the government for immediate wage rises and a general increase in military
spending.
Last week the navy's second-in-command said Argentina was defenceless, while
Mr Erman Gonzalez, defence minister, complained that General Martn Bonnet,
army commander, earned only Dollars 1,500 (Pounds 872) a month compared with
a congressman's salary of Dollars 3,500.
However, Mr Gonzalez said the military's demands were 'logical, but
politically difficult to digest. I have no doubt that military discipline
will prevail. Coups d'etat are things of the past.'
None the less, one leading military analyst warned that another mutiny later
this year was inevitable unless the government increased wages.
Mr Domingo Cavallo, the economy minister battling to contain government
spending, firmly rejected the generals' demands.
Argentina's military budget is about Dollars 2bn, or 2 per cent of its gross
domestic product, with wages alone accounting for 80 per cent of spending.
The generals' demand for a 30-40 per cent wage increase would add about
Dollars 40m-Dollars 53m a month to government expenditure.
President Carlos Menem's support for Mr Cavallo forced the commanders to
cancel a joint meeting planned for today at which they and senior officers
were to have resigned, triggering confrontation with the government.
Argentina and South Africa are in negotiations to re-establish diplomatic
relations and resume sporting links.
If the talks are successful, Argentina will become the first country to lift
the international sports boycott, with an August tour of Argentina by the
Springboks rugby team.
Diplomatic relations, which were broken off in 1986, should be resumed later
this year.

FT  14 MAY 91 / No-boom Midwest survives without bust / A look at why the
downturn has been less severely felt than in the rest of the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA DURR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VISITORS to Chicago from recession-racked cities such as New York and Boston
are surprised - even envious - to find there is little sign of economic
gloom in the Windy City. The American Midwest, of which Chicago is the
financial and industrial capital, is weathering the current US recession
relatively painlessly.
The secret to the Midwest's success is not that it is enjoying a miraculous
renaissance but that it did most of its hurtful shrinkage and
belt-tightening in the early and mid-1980s.
While regions such as New England were revelling in 1980s booms, the Midwest
was becoming 'slimmer and grimmer', says Mr Haskell Benishay, professor of
managerial economics at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of
Management. Or as the refrain among Midwest economic analysts goes, 'No
boom, no bust.'
The US recession of 1981 prompted a significant cut in Midwestern productive
capacity and a higher technology retooling. In addition, the farming sector
has emerged from a mid-1980s agricultural slump competitively leaner and far
less in debt.
Several key factors are involved in allowing the Midwest to ease through the
American economic downturn, including the relative health of the property
market, a boost of exports helped by a lower valued dollar, and the
attraction of investment to the region, in particular by the Japanese.
While there is some weakness in the Midwest property market, it is doing
better than other American regions. Midwestern housing did not appreciate in
the 1980s; now there is an incipient housing pick-up.
According to Commerce Department figures, Midwestern housing permits rose 14
per cent in March compared with December last year. February housing starts
were up 77 per cent on January's levels.
Regional home values actually rose last year and are even expected to
outperform other parts of the country during the 1990s, according to Ms
Diane Swonk, regional economist for the First National Bank of Chicago.
The declining trend in the US dollar has buoyed Midwestern exports and
foreign sales. US capital goods exports hit a record high in the fourth
quarter of 1990 and much of America's capital goods production is
concentrated in the Midwest, according to Mr John Silvia, chief economist
for Kemper Financial Services.
While there are no good statistics on regional exports, the state of
Illinois said its exports increased last year by 24 per cent and state
officials expect these to rise again this year by 12 per cent.
Chicago area-based Illinois Tool Works saw foreign sales jump to 50 per cent
of its total of Dollars 2.54bn (Pounds 1.47bn) last year. Although ITW
produces much of what it sells overseas at its plants abroad, the 1990
portion of its foreign sales was double what it was five years ago, said Mr
W. H. Farrell, ITW's executive vice-president.
More noteworthy still, Mr Farrell said, the company recently halted plans to
invest further in Germany, choosing instead to produce at home and export.
He said the US was a better prospect than Europe regarding costs for
building, fuel, and wage and benefits packages.
While Midwest wages are regarded as high in comparison with those in other
parts of the country, productivity is also higher.
This is one of the reasons why 60 per cent of the American motor vehicle
industry remains in the Midwest. But the industry is both the blessing and
the curse of the region.
It provides many well-paid manufacturing jobs; but its cyclical nature, with
the concomitant problems of unemployment and drops in local consumer
spending, is a big disadvantage.
The large number of recent plant closures by Detroit's Big Three car-makers
has hurt the Midwest in particular, and more pain is forecast because of
continuing industry overcapacity. The Japanese transplants have, however,
helped offset the regional job losses. And, even with a slack US car market,
their plans to export Japanese cars to Europe promise to help keep them
running at capacity.
The best-laid export plans may, however, be spoiled if the dollar continues
its recent upward path. But with respect to domestic-destined industrial
production, the Midwest has been lucky never to have become heavily
dependent, as have other areas, on defence spending. The pull-back in
defence spending has hit other regions, such as New England and the west,
far harder.
The Midwest will, however, have to cope with some serious problems ahead:
its infrastructure is ageing; its population is declining; its foreign trade
could become uncompetitive as the dollar shifts and other regions re-tool
with more advanced technology. The free trade agreement with Mexico could
also further siphon off manufacturing, especially car industry, jobs.
Midwest banks, reflecting the national picture, are also due for some
shrinkage because of over-capacity.
'We're coming back from a very weak position. But now, we're going to have
to fight for every inch,' said Mr Robert Schnorbus, business conditions
economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.

THE Canadian government will seek powers to hold a national referendum or

deal with Quebec and other changes in the country's political structure,
writes Bernard Simon in Toronto.
The government said in a Throne Speech during the opening of parliament in
Ottawa yesterday that it planned to reveal its proposals for a new
constitution this September. A parliamentary commission will consult widely
with the provinces and the public on proposals, and aim to report by
February 1992.
The initiatives seek to calm fears that forthcoming talks with Quebec and
the other nine provinces will occur without full public participation.

FT  14 MAY 91 / World Trade News: NEI Reyrolle wins Pounds 100m Dubai power
order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON and ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEI REYROLLE, part of Rolls-Royce's industrial power group, has won the UK's
largest Middle Eastern order since the end of the Gulf War with a turnkey
contract worth more than Pounds 100m to supply three sub-stations to Dubai,
Andrew Baxter reports.
The closely-fought contract is the biggest export order for Reyrolle, which
provides switchgear and sub-stations for transmitting and distributing
electricity, and the largest transmission sub-station contract awarded to a
UK company.
Reyrolle is part of Northern Engineering Industries, which was bought by
Rolls-Royce in 1989. The contract is NEI's biggest since 1982, when it won
an order, then worth Pounds 230m, for the Rihand coal-fired power station
project in India.
NEI said yesterday that the Dubai order would provide extra job security
over the next two years for 2,000 Reyrolle workers at Hebburn, Tyneside, and
create 'a few extra jobs'.
NEI Peebles at Edinburgh, which employs 500, will also benefit from the
contract by supplying eight transformers.
NEI has been relatively successful in the Middle East, with Reyrolle
recently completing its third substation in Saudi Arabia since 1987 in a
series of deals worth about Pounds 80m. NEI Power Projects has also
completed work on converting five gas turbines at a Bahrain aluminium plant
to the more efficient combined cycle operation.
But NEI was hit badly by UN sanctions against Iraq after the invasion of
Kuwait. This prevented the company from supplying four turbine generators,
worth about Pounds 70m, for a power station at Al Shemal and caused 650 job
losses at NEI Parsons in Newcastle.
The Dubai contract is for three 400kV substations, and includes the supply
of 28 circuits of 400kV gas-insulated switchgear. Work will start
immediately, and construction and commissioning continue into early 1993.
Reyrolle will subcontract the civil design and construction to SAE Sadelmi,
the Italian electrical contractor, while Kennedy and Donkin of the UK will
be the consulting engineers. Mr Graham Shepley, Reyrolle managing director,
said the news reinforced Reyrolle's position 'as a world leader in
sub-station design and construction'.
James Buxton writes: Weir Westgarth, the subsidiary of the Glasgow-based
Weir Group, has won a contract worth Pounds 70m for a desalination plant at
Jebel Ali in Dubai. The plant is part of a project worth about Pounds 500m
for a gas turbine and desalination plant which will provide 400MW of power
and 60m imperial gallons of drinking water, with the waste heat from the
turbines being used in the desalination plant.

NEPALESE voters appear to have delivered an upset by voting communist in the
capital, Kathmandu, in the nation's first multi-party parliamentary
elections in 32 years.
Preliminary results suggest the Communist party defeated the centrist Nepali
Congress Party in all five Kathmandu constituencies, including the seat
contested by Mr Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, leader of the Congress party. He
has been prime minister of the coalition cabinet that has ruled Nepal since
last year's revolt against the king.
Mr Bhattarai ran against Mr Madhan Kumar Mandari, general secretary of the
Communist party.
Counting began for 29 of the country's 205 parliamentary constituencies
yesterday.
Twenty one out of the 205 constituencies will hold new elections today after
charges of irregularities, ranging from stuffing ballot boxes to dumping
ballots in the river.
Final results of the election are expected later this week.

<TEXT>
BRITISH Royal Marines are believed to have wounded two Iraqi soldiers in an
exchange of fire near one of President Saddam Hussein's palaces in northern
Iraq.
Allied forces sealed off the area, close to the town of Amadiyah, as the
atmosphere remained tense.
The incident reportedly began when Iraqi troops fired three rounds from the
palace across the front of a marine position. The British forces did not
return fire then.
Almost two hours later, a high-velocity round was fired at the UK position
from the same area and the marines replied with a single shot from the post
at Ayn Shaykh, close to Amadiyah and inside the allies' safe haven.
Five minutes later, two men emerged from a blockhouse on the palace wall and
fired 'long bursts' with automatic weapons, a UK military spokesman said.
'Royal Marines returned fire and they believe two Iraqis were hit.'
Shortly afterwards, two more shots were fired from the palace.
Iraq later issued a statement denying it had been involved in an exchange of
fire with marines.
In Zhako, several hundred Kurds besieged 50 Iraqi police in the local police
station before US troops persuaded the crowd to disperse.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Charity counts blessings amid aid fatigue / A look at
Christian Aid as it launches its 35th annual appeal for funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO THE many crises that have hit the developing world this year, a new one
has recently been added: aid fatigue. Christian Aid, however, which
yesterday launched the 35th Christian Aid week, claims so far to be immune.
Although the Charities Aid Foundation has estimated that average household
donations in Britain dropped by a third in recent years, Christian Aid's
income in the last financial year held up well.
'We don't seem to have been affected by aid fatigue. Our support seems to
have been maintained, even during the last three months,' says Mr Paul
Tyler, head of finance at Christian Aid. This may be because of Christian
Aid's link with the churches.
It is sponsored by 41 churches and benefits from church fund raising.
Christian Aid week is Britain's biggest regular fund-raising event - and the
longest-running. Last year it raised Pounds 6.7m and this year hopes for at
least Pounds 8m, with 400,000 volunteers delivering 16m collecting envelopes
throughout Britain.
The charity has come a long way from its roots as Christian Reconstruction
in Europe, when it was set up in 1944 to help rebuild church and family life
across the war-torn continent. One grant from its first Pounds 1m - raised
through Victory in Europe collections and church grants - went towards
buying hundreds of bicycles to enable clergy on the continent to get around
their ruined parishes. Another funded a caravan stocked by Sainsburys on the
Austro-Hungarian border to feed Hungarian refugees.
In later decades the charity, renamed Christian Aid, built on its experience
of refugee relief and resettlement in Europe and now works in more than 70
countries.
It differs from all the overseas aid agencies except Cafod, the Catholic
Fund for Overseas Development, in that it does not have its own staff based
overseas, but works through indigenous church and other organisations. It
aims to be an 'enabler', providing the funds and the means for local people
to carry out aid and development work.
'Setting up an expatriate operation abroad is very time-consuming and
costly, and it's very difficult to shift from that to something
sustainable,' says Mr Paul Spray, head of aid.
'If you start with an organisation that is already there and set up, the
chances of sustaining it are much greater.'
Although the charity received about a third of its Pounds 33m income last
year from government sources, most of it from the Overseas Development
Agency for disaster relief, most of the rest was spent not on disaster
relief but on long-term development programmes such as providing medical
assistance in India, installing solar-powered water pumps in Somalia, and
leadership training and advising farmers in Chile.
Christian Aid shares its funds almost equally among churches, other
Christian organisations, and secular groups.
Education and campaigning inevitably plays an important part in Christian
Aid's work, accounting for up to 10 per cent of expenditure - and can be a
source of criticism, although the charity has so far avoided any clashes
with the Charity Commission, the British charities watchdog. The commission
last week published a report instructing Oxfam, Britain's biggest overseas
aid charity, to stop mixing politics with charitable work, which could have
important implications for other organisations such as Christian Aid.
'There is an area of unclarity about what charities can do,' says Michael
Taylor, Christian Aid's director. 'But you can't have charity without
politics. If a charity has a real concern for the good of the poor, it must
be prepared to encourage governments to adopt policies that help the
situation and don't make it worse.'

THE Soviet parliament last night again failed to guarantee its citizens the
right of free travel abroad, after one of the Supreme Soviet's two houses
refused to pass an emigration bill on grounds of expense, writes John Lloyd
in Moscow.
The bill has been two years in preparation, and received its first reading
18 months ago. It will probably come back to the Supreme Soviet on Thursday,
when a commission set up to break the impasse is expected to produce a
compromise.
Mr Vladimir Petrovsky, a deputy foreign minister, said yesterday that
discussion of the bill was confined to expense and technicalities, not to
principles. However, many of those arguing against the bill were from the
hardline Soyuz camp.
The bill guarantees that Soviet citizens who apply to travel abroad will
receive their passports within a month, while those who wish to emigrate
will get them in three months. . No Soviet citizen will be denied entry, as
many dissidents have in the past.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Cossiga rebukes top judge in row over Mafia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S President Francesco Cossiga has withdrawn his support for Mr
Giovanni Galloni, the deputy president of the Consiglio Superiore della
Magistratura (CSM), the ruling body for the judiciary, in a public row over
increasing Mafia violence.
In a step bound to trigger a new crisis between the presidency and the legal
establishment, Mr Cossiga yesterday revoked Mr Galloni's powers to represent
him as constitutional head of the CSM.
Mr Cossiga, who as head of state is also head of the CSM, cannot sack Mr
Galloni, as he is elected independently by judges and magistrates.
The president's unprecedented step, which has come as a shock to judges and
politicians alike, follows growing friction with Mr Galloni and the
judiciary on the question of organised crime, notably in southern Italy.
Gang warfare in the south, especially Calabria, has reached new heights in
the past fortnight, with almost daily tit-for-tat murders.
The latest clash between the president and the judiciary follows a call by
Mr Cossiga last week for special measures to fight crime. Among other
suggestions, he spoke out against sending inexperienced young magistrates to
the south.
'It is unbelievable that, just because he has passed an exam in Roman law, a
young man is able to conduct complex investigations into the Mafia and the
drugs trade,' he said.
That provoked a quick response from Mr Galloni in the name of judicial
independence. 'The young people thrown into the most difficult regions
should be thanked and cannot be - I won't say insulted - but repudiated in
their functions,' he said.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Wreckage left by Soviet troops in east Germany
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A man inspects the wreck of a Soviet military vehicle at a former barracks
in Forst Zinna, a village near Juterborg in east Germany. In the background
is scrap, also left by Soviet troops when they went home. Waste left
elsewhere includes used oil and old ammunition. A Berlin official said
yesterday that ecological damage left by Soviet troops in east Germany could
take billions of marks to clean up although a reliable study had yet to be
conducted.
Following German unification, the Soviet Union has agreed to withdraw
380,000 soldiers and their 220,000 family members from eastern Germany by
the end of 1994. Now, concerns about who pays for cleaning up the ecological
damage left behind have increased.
The weekly newsmagazine Der Spiegel claims wastes have been poured on to the
ground or buried in military training areas controlled by the Soviets.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Ryzhkov is hardliners' choice to take on Yeltsin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR NIKOLAI RYZHKOV, the former Soviet prime minister who stepped down last
year following a heart attack, is emerging as the hardline challenger to Mr
Boris Yeltsin for the Russian presidency.
Candidates for the presidency must register before May 21. Each must secure
either 100,000 supporting signatures, or the backing of at least a fifth of
the deputies in the Russian parliament.
The election will be held on June 12.
Mr Yeltsin is considered a clear favourite, but Mr Ryzhkov will gather
support from large numbers of people in the military, industry and the
bureaucracy who are worried by the economic crisis and to whom he offers
reassurance and order.
At the same time, both he and Mr Yeltsin are careful not to stray too far
away from the centre, as the centripetal forces of the first ever popular
election make themselves felt. Mr Yeltsin, who together with Mr Gorbachev
met leaders of the autonomous republics within Russia last Sunday, is doing
all he can to project the image of a man concerned for the future of the
country and working for stability in harness with the Soviet president.
Mr Ryzhkov, for his part, told the armed forces newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda
that he supported a 'moderately radical way' which would allow Russia to
'live better' and would revive it 'without breaking up the union . . . in a
peaceful, calm way with all positions duly taken into account'.
Mr Yeltsin's organisational base is in the Democratic Russia movement and
the independent unions, while Mr Ryzhkov has attracted the support of the
hardline Soyuz group of deputies and the Russian Communist party.
Both men will face other contenders. Mr Vadim Bakatin, a member of Mr
Mikhail Gorbachev's presidential council and a former interior minister, is
still hesitating over entering the lists, but is presenting himself as a
centrist candidate avoiding the 'extremes' of Mr Yeltsin and Mr Ryzhkov.
From the hard left, Mr Alexei Sergeev, an economist, has been nominated by
the United Workers Front, some of whose representatives carried pictures of
Stalin in Red Square during the May Day rally earlier this month.
On the radical side, Mr Aman Tuleev, chairman of Kemerovo regional soviet in
the heart of the radical miners' country, will stand on the ticket that Mr
Yeltsin has betrayed the radical cause by signing an agreement with Mr
Gorbachev to support the anti-crisis plan.
The first application for the post of presidency, however, has been filed by
Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of the Liberal Democratic party, a group
which has proclaimed itself as centrist and has until recently had a close
relationship both with the Communist party and the security forces.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Gorbachev targets key sectors of Soviet economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Mikhail Gorbachev yesterday signed a decree establishing a
'special regime' in key economic sectors. It was presented as offering
incentives to workers who raise their output, although Mr Valentin Pavlov,
the Soviet prime minister, last week described the plan in harsher terms. He
said it would allow the government to arrest and bring to trial those who
went on, or called for, a strike.
The independent news agency Interfax reported that the decree allowed
increased autonomy in such basic industries as mining, steel and chemical
production, transport and energy extraction. It would permit companies to
retain 10 per cent of income earned on domestic or foreign markets.
The decree appears to be modelled on the agreement with the mineworkers,
both in tying extra wages to extra production and in allowing enterprises to
distribute profits among the workforce.
At the same time, Mr Gorbachev's office has announced a clutch of new,
part-time presidential advisers of a moderately liberal (reformist
Communist) bent. They include Dr Leonid Abalkin, the economist, who was
deputy prime minister and head of economic reform until late last year.
The other advisers are Mr Vladimir Kudryavtsev, director of the Institute of
State and Law and a key shaper of legislation under Mr Gorbachev; Mr Vladen
Martynov, director of the Institute of World Economy and International
Relations, now a fairly radical think tank; Mr Yuri Osipian, a leading
physicist, vice president of the Academy of Science and already on the
presidential council; and Mr Boris Oleinik, a deputy chairman of the Soviet
of Nationalities in the Supreme Soviet and a poet.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S big banks have responded quickly to Sunday's one percentage point
cut in the discount rate to 11.5 per cent by lowering their rates to
borrowers and lenders. The move, which has been warmly welcomed by business,
should help mitigate some of the inflationary consequences of the indirect
tax increases agreed in Saturday's mini-budget.
It will also play an important part in lowering the financing costs on
Italy's huge government debt, and may help improve the lira's
competitiveness following complaints that it is overvalued. The lira fell to
L741.95 against the D-Mark yesterday, against Friday's L739.87.
Saturday's budget package, which imposed a L30,000 (Pounds 13.70) tax on
credit cards and a swingeing increase in the licence on four-wheel drive
vehicles, has been condemned as discriminatory by credit card companies and
some motor manufacturers.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Launch of Croat daily blocked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY, East Europe Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BRITISH-FINANCED independent and liberal newspaper which was due to appear
today in the Yugoslav republic of Croatia was blocked from publication
yesterday when Vejsnik, the republic's largest newspaper group, prevented
its contracted printers from having any dealings with the new daily.
The move appears to confirm suspicions by foreign investors that the
republic remains reluctant to allow genuine competition, despite its
rhetoric about wanting to introduce privatisation and the market economy.
But the printing ban on Zapad ('West') could also hold wider political
implications for Yugoslavia's second largest republic.
A Croatian journalist, unconnected with either paper, said Zapad would have
broken the Croatian government's overbearing influence over the media 'by
telling the truth and by giving its readers a choice'.
Another commented: 'The move to block the paper's printing has political
overtones. I do not like to say this, but Mr Franjo Tudjman (the president
of Croatia) is waging a propaganda war against Serbia. His right-wing
government has little patience for any journalists who do not toe the
party's political line.'
Zapad, intended to have a circulation of more than 100,000, and modelled on
Spain's El Pais, is financed by Tricapital, a UK company which has
international interests in oil, property and energy, and Zapad Media, a
private company based in Zagreb, the capital of Croatia.
Mr Strock, the director of Zapad Media, retains the majority share,
Tricapital has a large minority share, and the remaining 10 per cent is held
by the 40 or so journalists. Mr Strock, who was born in Croatia, has lived
in the UK for the past 14 years.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Community and Efta reach broad agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Community early today reached broad agreement on most of the
outstanding issues in extending its single market to the seven countries of
the European Free Trade Association (Efta).
Switzerland brought 12 hours of talks to the point of collapse by demanding
an individual right to opt out of future legislation governing the 19-nation
European Economic Area (EEA). But it eventually bowed to its Efta partners
and the EC in agreeing that any future exemptions would have to be
negotiated.
Efta countries won their key demand for their judges to sit alongside those
of the European Community's Court of Justice to interpret disputes under EEA
law.
The other main sticking point - Spain's demand for access to Icelandic
fishing waters in return for improved access for Efta fish products to the
EC - was finessed. Mr Jacques Poos, Luxembourg's foreign minister presiding
over the EC side, claimed 'a method' had been agreed for negotiators to
bridge the gap between Spain's demand for 90,000 tonnes a year of mainly
Icelandic fish and Iceland's refusal to make any concession at all.
The highly charged issue of free trade in fish has so far been one of the
biggest obstacles to agreement between the EC and Efta countries.
If the 18-month long negotiation between the two groupings is successfully
concluded as planned next month - and the EEA treaty ratified by all Efta
parliaments - Efta countries will start putting on their statute books some
1,400 pages of EC internal market legislation developed over the past 30
years.
Mr Frans Andriessen, EC external affairs commissioner, described the
negotiations as far more complex than individual Efta states joining the
Community outright.
The EEA required special institutional arrangements, allowing Efta states a
say, but not a vote, in the shaping of EC law and its interpretation,
without compromising the EC's formal decision-making machinery.
But inserted into the final communique was Switzerland's insistence that it
could only accept a final EEA treaty if it was 'global and balanced'.
The seven nations of Efta are Sweden, Norway, Finland, Iceland, Austria,
Switzerland and associate member Liechtenstein. A full accord with the EC
would create a 19-nation market of 380m consumers.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Share prices fall steeply on fears that base rate cut may be
delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN London were hit yesterday by fears that the government may keep
interest rates at their current levels this week, in spite of growing
concern about the seriousness of the recession.
Many companies feel that cuts in base rates, now at 12 per cent, will be
required if the UK economy is to recover later this year in line with
government expectations.
Treasury efforts yesterday to cool hopes of an imminent cut in rates
preceded a downturn in the FT-SE 100 index, which closed 37.7 lower at
2,486.6.
Trading was also affected by weakness on Wall Street - although the Dow
Jones Industrial Average finished in positive terrority, closing 4.25 up at
2,924.42 after a weak start - and disquiet among investors at the election
fever gripping both the main political parties.
In spite of government caution on interest rates, there is a growing belief
in the City that monetary policy will be eased soon after the weekend, if
there is no rate this week. However, Mr Norman Lamont remains worried by
lack of evidence that underlying inflation, particularly related to wages,
is coming down.
Data from the Central Statistical Office yesterday showed that consumer
credit demand remained subdued in the first three months of the year, while
the volume of retail sales fell 0.6 per cent compared with the equivalent
period last year.
On the foreign exchanges, sterling remained firm. In London it rose 1.3
cents to Dollars 1.7320, and improved to DM2.9675 from DM2.9650, gaining
further in New York, to Dollars 1.734 and DM2.97295.
London money markets continued to discount a rate cut, with the three-month
sterling interbank rate quoted at 11 9/16 -11 1/2 per cent, against 11 9/16
 11 7/16 on Friday.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Poll points to big Labour victory in Monmouth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR IS heading for a sweeping victory in Thursday's by-election in
Monmouth, according to an opinion poll which gives the party an 8 percentage
point lead.
The poll will intensify pressure from Conservative MPs for another cut in
interest rates to ease the impact of the recession on the government's
supporters in the southern half of England.
In spite of the public reservations of the Treasury and the Bank of England,
some ministers expect a  1/2 percentage point reduction in base rates this
week. Mr John Major, the prime minister, is said to share their concern to
see an across-the-board reduction in mortgage rates.
On Friday figures are likely to show a sharp drop in the inflation rate last
month to about 6 per cent. That could provide an appropriate backdrop for
lower base rates.
Some senior Conservatives, however, would like an earlier announcement in
the hope of winning back wavering supporters in Monmouth, where the Tories
are defending a majority of 9,350.
Although Mr Major has now set his sights on autumn as the earliest possible
date for a general election, ministers believe it is vital the voters feel
the benefit of lower interest rates as quickly as possible.
With unemployment set to rise sharply over the next few months, the
government is basing its hopes of a strong electoral recovery on the
expectation that lower inflation and interest rates will boost the incomes
of those in work.
However, colleagues of Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, acknowledge that he
would risk destabilising sterling's strong position on the European exchange
rate mechanism if he were seen by financial markets to be seeking to drive
down borrowing costs too quickly.
The Treasury yesterday sought to damp hopes of an imminent cut. Mr David
Mellor, chief secretary to the Treasury, told BBC radio that the government
would ease borrowing conditions only when prudent.
The poll in Monmouth, carried out by NOP for HTV Wales and The Independent
newspaper, gives Labour candidate Mr Huw Edwards 41 per cent, Tory candidate
Mr Roger Evans 33 per cent and Mrs Frances David, for the Liberal Democrats,
24 per cent. Mr Mel Witherden, the joint Green/Plaid Cymru candidate, polled
1 per cent.
Both Labour and the Tories were yesterday targeting Liberal Democrat voters
for the last few days of the campaign, and emphasising that the contest was
a straight fight between the two main parties.
'The situation remains as we have said all along,' said Tory campaigners.
'The choice for the people of Monmouth is clear: if they don't wish to be
represented by a socialist in parliament they must back Roger Evans on
Thursday.'
Mr Edwards called the figures 'very encouraging'. He issued an appeal to
Liberal Democrat supporters not to split the anti-Tory vote.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said the by-election remained
'wide open', while arguing that the survey showed the Tories could not win.
'The choice for this constituency, and especially for traditional
Conservative voters, is now whether they want a Labour member of parliament
or a Liberal Democrat MP born and bred in Monmouth,' he said.
The party publishes its canvass returns this morning.
NOP interviewed 1,106 people across the constituency between last Thursday
and Sunday.

FT  14 MAY 91 / NatWest proposes market in small company shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Westminster Bank is considering setting up a market in small
company shares to rival the London stock exchange.
Its proposal is in response to the government's call for innovative ideas to
extend share ownership. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has invited
suggestions from the private sector on how to provide a cheap way for people
to use high street outlets to buy and sell shares.
In response to the Treasury's invitation, a project team from NatWest
Stockbrokers is developing ideas on how the bank could best offer an
'over-the-counter' market for shares in small companies.
The bank already provides instant share dealing in 550 companies through its
touch-screen service in 278 branches. Those screens could be equipped to
quote the prices of small companies at relatively little expense to the
bank, which could offer access to its market to the public as well as to its
own customers. Ministers believe the scheme could lead to a wider share
ownership. There are currently more than 11m individual shareholders,
compared with about 3m in 1979.
Mr Neil Stapley, managing director of NatWest Stockbrokers, said: 'We are
looking at setting up a separate market for small companies. I have been
looking at various ways of extending share ownership.'
Senior NatWest directors believe the proposal could be implemented by the
end of the summer, although it still has to be approved by the bank's board.
They believe a number of small companies, which are either unlisted or have
failed to find a home since the demise of the Third Market last year, would
welcome the opportunity of being quoted in a market run by the bank.
The directors see no need to get approval for their scheme from the stock
exchange because the bank is already regulated by The Securities and Futures
Authority (formerly The Securities Association).
The stock exchange, which has already set up a committee to look at the
general illiquidity in small companies, is unlikely to be keen on an
independent NatWest market.
Mr Andrew Hugh Smith, the stock exchange chairman, said: 'The banks are in a
position to offer a cheaper service than brokers. But I hope we would
provide sufficient value for them to do it in our market.'
NatWest directors are confident that ministers, anxious to widen share
ownership among individuals before the next election, would help push
through the proposal in the face of any stock exchange opposition.
The Treasury has made it clear than any proposal aimed at spreading share
ownership more widely, particularly through retail outlets, would be
welcomed.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Winnie Mandela found guilty of kidnapping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Winnie Mandela, wife of Mr Nelson Mandela, deputy president of the
African National Congress (ANC), was convicted yesterday by a South African
court of kidnapping and being an accessory after the fact to four assaults.
Looking pale and stunned, 72-year-old Mr Mandela listened from the public
gallery as Mr Justice Michael Stegmann told the Rand Supreme Court in
Johannesburg that Mrs Mandela had 'showed herself on a number of occasions
to be a calm, composed, deliberate and unblushing liar'. Mr Mandela was
serving a life sentence for conspiring to overthrow the state when the
crimes took place.
Under South African law kidnapping is a capital offence, although Mrs
Mandela is certain to face a lesser punishment. Sentence will be announced
later today, after evidence in mitigation from the defence. Legal experts
familiar with the case said it seemed likely she would face a period in
jail.
Mr Justice Stegmann said he accepted Mrs Mandela's alibi, that she was on
her way to the town of Brandfort, over 180 miles away, when the kidnapping
and assaults took place. But he found that she and a co-accused, Mrs Xoliswa
Falati, had conspired to kidnap the four activists, including a 14-year-old
boy, Stompie Seipei, who was later found with his throat slit in a Soweto
ditch.
Mrs Mandela, he said, was one of the 'moving spirits' behind the kidnapping.
To imagine that it had taken place without her prior knowledge was like
imagining 'Hamlet without the Prince', he said. He further found Mrs Mandela
guilty of accessory after the fact to the crime of assault with intent to
commit grievous bodily harm against the four boys. This is a less serious
crime that than of the assault itself for which she was originally charged.
The four were seriously assaulted in an outside room at her Soweto home on
December 29 1988, leaving the walls of the room spattered with blood. She
was absent at the time, but on her return two days later, he found that she
must have known of or suspected the assaults and thus had 'assisted' and
'associated herself' with the attackers.
A radiantly smiling Mrs Mandela said outside the court: 'You can see how
delighted I am'.
Clipping her words short, and only barely suppressing her rage, she said:
'As long as you all now know that I did not assault any child, that's all
that matters to me. The rest I leave to my lawyers.'
Her reaction was in marked contrast to that of her husband, who stood by her
side looking grey with shock, his normally erect shoulders bowed beneath his
tightly belted overcoat. Mr Mandela's posture and deeply pained facial
expression raised fears about his health and ability to withstand the
distress of seeing his wife go to jail.
Mrs Mandela's conviction could further strain relations between the ANC, of
which she is a senior leader, and the government at a time when the two
sides are involved in tough negotiations over measures to end township
violence. The ANC has threatened to pull out of talks on the country's
political future unless Pretoria agrees to ban spears from public gatherings
by Thursday.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (11): Search for new
applications - Robotics, still on the fringe of the industrial sector
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FOR all the hype over the past 20 years about how robots would transform
manufacturing industry, they still remain on the fringes of the industrial
scene - with the notable exception of manufacturing in Japan.
According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, the world
industrial robot population stood at 388,000 units at the end of 1989, of
which 220,000 were in Japan, 56,000 in western Europe, 37,000 in the US and
 -very roughly - 75,000 elsewhere.
There are a number of interconnected reasons for this situation. In the
past, there has been considerable hostility from trade unions to their
introduction and managements have taken a lot of convincing about the cost
benefits.
Dr Kevin Clarke, manager of manufacturing engineering at PA Consulting
Group, says that, in many instances, robots have not delivered the cost
effectiveness they have promised. Robot manufacturers, he says, have not
developed their products technologically as fast as they might have.
'There's very little innovation, because the market isn't there,' he says.
However, the evidence of the past two years suggests that things may be
changing. Those 388,000 units represented an increase of 20 per cent from
the end of 1988, and in 1990 US-based robotics companies won record new
orders of Dollars 517.4m.
The robotics industry was in deep gloom during 1986 and 1987, and especially
in the US where it had become far too dependent on the motor industry -
which took about 40 to 50 per cent of sales.
Mr Donald Vincent, executive vice-president of the US Robotic Industries
Association, recalls that 'when the automotive industry quit buying in 1986
and 1987, it sent robotics into a deep spin.'
This decline had two results. First, it encouraged a much-needed
concentration among robot producers. In the middle of the 1980s there were
some 300, according to the International Federation of Robotics (IFR). Now,
it says, there are probably fewer than 100 true producers, led by ABB
Robotics, part of the Swiss-Swedish Asea Brown Boveri, GMF Robotics, a joint
venture between Fanuc of Japan and General Motors of the US, and Yaskawa of
Japan.
Secondly, the downturn prompted an urgent search for new applications for
robots away from the motor industry and its inherent cyclicality. Dr Clarke
singles out 'clean room' applications for robots in health care and
precision engineering, while Mr Vincent is hopeful of new applications in
the food industry, materials handling and packaging.
The wellspring for this diversification into new markets, which has already
begun, is computer power. In mechanical terms, robots are relatively simple
beasts, and robotic technology has always been based on the use of computers
to overcome mechanical limitations.
Mr Kenneth Waldron, a robotics expert at Ohio State University, says 'the
major theme which will direct commercial applications of new research in
robotics will be that of taking advantage of the huge increases in computing
power which have become available as a result of the development of advanced
microprocessors.'
Mr Waldron notes that most current industrial robot systems offer only
incremental improvements over what was possible with the first generation of
microcomputer controllers.
Current research is looking at areas such as greater use of sensing - of the
robot's environment and internal state - more sophisticated control
techniques offering greater speed and accuracy, robotic mobility and
improved control of the interface between the robot and the workpiece.
Given these trends, there has inevitably been considerable interest in
industrial vision systems for robots, which could radically change many
applications, particularly in assembly where robots have so far failed to
make their mark.
Previous forecasts for the population of vision-equipped robots have not
been realised, but it is reasonable to predict, as the IFR has, that the
continuous reduction in prices of computers and sensors, and their greater
speed and reliability, will gradually remove the technological and economic
barriers.
Many of the business trends in robotics over the past few years are
illustrated by developments at ABB Robotics, which claims to be the world's
biggest supplier - a title which the Japanese manufacturers might dispute.
ABB's purchase last year of Cincinnati Milacron's robotics business was an
important step in the consolidation of the industry around leading European
and Japanese suppliers. Mr Stelio Demark, head of ABB Robotics, says the
Cincinnati business brought with it a tremendous US customer base and
undoubted expertise in spot-welding robotics.
The nature of ABB's customer base has also been changing, and over the past
five years it has reduced its dependence on the automotive industry from
70-75 per cent of sales to 50 per cent. ABB is attracting new business from
small and medium-sized companies which had previously not bought robots. 'We
may be supplying ones and twos, but it's growing very quickly,' says Mr
Demark.
New markets include glass making, different kinds of process applications,
and palletising. This effort is backed up by spending on research and
development - 10 per cent of revenues - that is almost on a par with that of
the pharmaceutical industry.
Meanwhile the falling cost of electronics is allowing ABB to build more
capability and flexibility into its robots. ABB's latest product, the IRB
6000, was officially launched last month with claims of much greater
flexibility and capability than rival products.
Because of these developments, Mr Demark is optimistic about future growth
prospects for ABB and the industry. The view is shared by independent
observers.
In a report about to be published by Frost &amp; Sullivan, the international
market research publishers, total world robot sales are forecast to rise
from Dollars 2.15bn in 1990 to Dollars 3.41bn in 1996. The relatively small
size of the industry at the end of the 1980s is a reflection of many of the
factors mentioned above.
F &amp; S sees the Japanese market's share of world robot sales falling from 65
per cent last year to 45 per cent in 1996, while Europe's share will rise
from 15 to 20 per cent, the US will mark time at about 6 per cent and the
rest of the world will jump from 14 per cent to just under 30 per cent.
The biggest growth area is Asia, which is good news for the Japanese
producers, but Europe, says Mr Demark, is also 'very interesting,' and the
company's home base. F &amp; S sees the European market rising from Dollars 330m
in 1990 to Dollars 687m in 1996, with Germany leading the way.
Looking specifically at the European market, F &amp; S comments that the
'supplier capable of marketing a complete package including sensors,
user-friendly software and simple training and installation will achieve the
best sales penetration.'
ABB is probably justified in claiming that it offers more service and
support to European buyers than the more product-based approach of the
Japanese, but Dr Clarke wonders whether this will still be true in two
years' time. On the other hand Europe, he says, is probably not one of the
Japanese producers' priorities, given the better growth prospects in the
Asia Pacific region.
As for the balance of power in the industry, both ABB and the Japanese are
growing stronger, the big producers are getting bigger, and the smaller
robotics companies, particularly in the US and UK, are concentrating on
niches and ancillary services.
If the big producers can keep up with development in computing, the 1990s
could well bring the rewards that proved so elusive for much fo the 1980s.

of one - Simultaneous Engineering
</HEADLINE>

THE time taken to design and manufacture a new product could be reduced
substantially if both operations were carried out together, instead of one
after the other as was the almost unavoidable practice in traditional
engineering before the widespread use of computer power.
Working out how to make a product in a mass production process at the same
time as the product is designed is the essence of simultaneous, concurrent
or integrated engineering, the various descriptions given to an emerging
approach to engineering where everything is done at once.
This may seem impossible. Yet computers have made it possible for work to
proceed on the design of a product at the same time as on the ways of making
the product.
With simultaneous engineering, the design of a new product takes account of
how it will be made, so that the easiest, most economic way to make the
product is chosen and is feasible.
Traditionally, if a design made it difficult for a company to manufacture
and mass produce the product as designed, then the design was modified until
the manufacturing difficulty was overcome.
The essence of simultaneous, or concurrent engineering is that account is
taken of the manufacturing process as the design proceeds, so avoiding
redesign at a late stage in the development of a product and its
manufacturing process.
An illustration of the importance of simultaneous engineering is the way new
products are designed using new materials, such as the advanced ceramic
materials that are being developed for jet engines.
These materials have distinct advantages over the metals traditionally used
for these applications, but in order for manufacturers to exploit these
advantages to the utmost, they have to take account of how these materials
will behave when they are used in production processes.
In other words, the production process has to be developed hand in hand with
the design of the product.
The only way to do this is through simultaneous engineering.
Mr James Angus, the team leader at the Rolls-Royce Advanced Ceramics Centre
at Warwick University, where integrated engineering techniques are being
developed for future jet engine components, says the integration of design
engineering, materials science and manufacturing technology is essential for
the new ceramic materials because, for the first time with any material, the
designer has the opportunity to design the material to suit exactly the
properties needed in a component.
This unusual way of designing a product or component has to take account of
the way the product will be manufactured and mass produced and vice versa,
otherwise the carefully tailored material properties of the component could
be lost.
Ms Sue Lyons, the director of manufacturing engineering at Rolls-Royce, says
'we are moving towards completely integrated or concurrent engineering
across the company.'
The integrated programme is being finalised and all technology groups, such
as stress and mechanical engineers and manufacturing specialists will come
together at the conceptual design stage of a new product.
Ms Lyons says 'the division between design and manufacturing could disappear
altogether.'
The change to integrated engineering is crucial because of the high
proportion of a product's cost that is set at the design stage.
In the case of a jet engine as much as 80 per cent of the cost of a new
product for the engine is fixed at the design stage. The aim is to reduce
this fixed cost element in a product by designing it so that it is easy to
manufacture.
It is possible to influence significantly the final cost of a product,
including its manufacturing cost, by the addition of only very little extra
cost at the design stage.
Mr Robin Blake, of Rolls-Royce says that 'concurrent engineering is not an
alternative for consideration, it is an absolute necessity. The demands to
reduce lead time and cost can only be met by teamwork in a concurrent
engineering environment.'
Computer systems available to handle concurrent engineering include systems
from Intergraph, one of the world's largest companies developing and
manufacturing interactive computer graphics for computer aided engineering.
Intergraph won an order last year, potentially worth Dollars 40m, from the
US Sandia National Laboratories for systems with a concurrent engineering
capability. The agreement called on Intergraph to supply hardware and
software for the Nirvana project, the code name for the Sandia National
Laboratories/US Department of Energy programme to implement a computer aided
design and manufacturing system with a concurrent engineering capability.
Nirvana was designed to help Sandia, which is the US Department of Energy
prime contractor for nuclear research, and its sub-contractors to move from
using multi-vendor, non-integrated solutions to particular problems to a
more efficient integrated approach.
In the first year of the agreement, Intergraph will supply a range of
engineering design software tools and about 140 of its Risc-based UNIX
workstations. The hardware and software will be used to integrate and
improve the design, manufacture and assembly of complex electronics-based
products.
These tools will operate under a common user framework. Product design
information will flow from initial system design, through sub-system design,
the design of printed circuit boards, hybrid and integrated circuit design
through mechanical design and on to manufacturing, including document
publishing.
Additional data is to be added to the design definition at each step and
design data from preceding steps will not need to be re-entered.
Mr Dick Fox, the UK marketing director of Intergraph says the result will be
high quality products designed and manufactured in a shorter period of time
than would otherwise be possible, one of the objects of concurrent
engineering.

the factories - Shop-Floor Systems, demand continues to grow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
ALMOST every type of computer hardware that exists in a commercial data
processing department can be found somewhere in a manufacturing environment.
The basic electronics of manufacturing technology is the same as in the rest
of the business world; it is the fine-tuning which is different.
Large manufacturers typically depend on a mainframe for their central
corporate functions and this is likely to continue.
Though most want to make more information available to users by introducing
distributed systems and client/server architectures, the need for the
biggest companies to consolidate and store large volumes of data will
probably persist. Only a mainframe can cope with that load.
Moreover, the spread of ED1 (electronic data interchange, or paperless
trading) could slow or even reverse the erosion of the role of the
mainframe.
However, as mainframes are no longer cheaper to run than smaller boxes,
manufacturing applications such as MRP systems have been steadily moving,
through a process of downsizing, from mainframes to mid-range machines or
even networks of personal computers.
The general change of management strategy in manufacturing, from central
control to local responsibility - the so-called cellular concept - favours
the spread of mid-range machines or PCs rather than mainframes.
In the past decade computing has brought great changes to the management of
manufacturing through MRP systems, but it has only just begun to make an
impact on the shop-floor.
Most shop-floors receive an action list as output from the MRP system and
that is as far as the computer stretches. The advent of the just-in-time
manufacturing philosophy has persuaded many companies that the computer has
to be introduced on the shop-floor to support the production process.
Shop-floor data collection is usually handled by a mid-range machine,
although PCs are replacing mid-range machines in some sites.
Mid-range open systems hardware based on the UNIX operating system is
beginning to be used in factories where the ability to integrate systems
from different manufacturers is essential.
Personal computers have changed the life of factories, if rather slower than
that of offices.
As factories get cleaner, standard PCs can be used in more and more places.
It is now often quite appropriate for an ordinary PC to be in a foreman's
office.
Tens of thousands of PCs, mainly IBM or clones, are scattered around British
factories. On the design side, workstations from companies such as Sun
Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard are the standard tools of the trade.
Where life is too rough for the standard PC, ruggedised machines are used.
In some cases robust terminals can be put on the shop-floor with the main
computing facility kept in a back office or, for that matter, in another
town or country. Local computing power is usually needed for many
applications that involve graphics or diagrams. For these the machine has to
be on site because the telecommunications system cannot transmit high
volumes of data over any great distance.
Specially adapted equipment or protective packaging may be needed in the
factory for many reasons, as Mr Graham Crocker, a manufacturing specialist
at IBM, points out. It may be dirty, the temperature may vary from very hot
to very cold, there may be vibration or disruption of the electricity
supply.
There may be risk of fire or liquid being spilled or worker's hands may be
greasy. There may be electromagnetic interference from other machines,
requiring computers to be kept in steel cases.
Shop-floor workers may be less familiar with computer systems than office
workers; special keyboards with function keys may be preferable to the
conventional Qwerty layout.
On the shop-floor small ruggedised hand-held computers from companies such
as Coventry-based Husky are being adopted by some large companies both for
data collection and for quality control.
At the Royal Doulton china factories, for example, Huskys are used to keep
track of the 40,000 types of product.
Hand-held and laptop machines have grown in popularity as they have got
lighter and their screens have become easier to read. At the same time they
have been enhanced by being able to store more data and to run longer before
the battery needs changing.
The principal requirement of the manufacturer which differs from that of the
commercial user is a high degree of hardware availability.
Reliability is one aspect of availability. Mr Richard Ridler, manufacturing
industry marketing manager for ICL, points out that whereas some office
systems can go down for 10 or 20 minutes occasionally without causing
anything worse than annoyance, in a factory this could be disastrous.
Mr Graham McKenzie, manufacturing systems manager with Digital, identifies
three levels of resilience.
Digital VAXes can be clustered so that if a disk drive fails on one recovery
can be achieved within a few minutes. Two machines can be connected within a
single cabinet so that if one goes down the other will pick up the task
within a few seconds. Or three machines can be tightly coupled so that if
one of them fails the process will carry on uninterrupted and unnoticed by
the user; this is normally called fault-tolerance.
Response time is another aspect of availability. Industrial users expect
subsecond response times for many functions, where office users could be
asked to be more patient.
A third factor is the working regime. Office systems are typically shut down
to users overnight and at weekends, whereas factory systems may have to work
a 24-hour day and about 360 days a year. It is therefore important for the
manufacturer to decide what level of availability is needed for his systems
before investing in hardware. Continuous uptime can be achieved, but the
price goes up as availability is increased.
Prospects for systems suppliers to manufacturers in the longer term must be
rated as good.
The negative signs are that, as in the office market, users are expecting to
pay less for more all the time and the market for MRP systems shows some
signs of saturation. Only the smaller factories do not have these systems
and they may either have no pressing need or no money to invest.
On the positive side the pressure of competition is making manufacturers
concentrate more on the need for automation, especially on the shop-floor.
Large manufacturers are getting stricter with their suppliers on quality,
forcing those companies to invest more in technology. Finally, the
technology itself is clearly becoming ever more capable of delivering real
benefits.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (10): Useful systems
for the well-connected - Manufacturing Software, the complexity of the
applications requires careful co-ordination
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SOFTWARE to control manufacturing is among the most complex of commercial
applications. In its most sophisticated form it entails connections between
customers, suppliers, accounting, warehousing and the shop-floor. Its
implementation must therefore be carefully co-ordinated.
In the 1960s, IBM, among others, recognising that manufactured products
could be progressively 'exploded' into a bill of materials, realised how
useful a computer could be in estimating the raw material quantities
required to make up finished goods. These databases, originally held on
punched cards, evolved rapidly. The data handling needs of Bill of Materials
Processing (Bomp), led software designers to create hierarchical databases,
from which products such as IBM's IMS
Early systems provided data for Materials Requirements Planning (MRP).
Take a manufactured item, reduce it into sub assemblies, then explode those
progressively until you have raw materials, multiply the numbers by the
overall quantity of finished goods needed, and you have an estimate of
overall requirements.
Ally that to a manufacturing schedule - showing which parts are needed when
 -and you have a planning system from which you can order goods.
Such systems were very useful for manufacturing goods made up of discrete
parts. However, for process applications - production of paint, foods or
other products - the process is not so simple. The number of a certain type
of switch or body panel needed to make a car does not vary. You may have
some wastage in small items such as nuts and bolts, but the quantities used
are still discrete. In continuous process manufacturing you must rely more
on statistics than precise figures. You are not producing one product at a
time, but a continuous stream of the product. The principles may seem
similar, but the practice is more complex.
A consideration common to both discrete and continuous process manufacturing
can be batch control. You may need to track a batch of finished goods from
its components, through to its eventual customers.
When a batch of yoghurt was found to contain botulism the manufacturers had
to be able to say precisely where the tainted goods had gone, and then go
back and identify the raw material responsible to find out which other goods
might be similarly affected. As a result, they were able to focus their
warnings on a particular set of hazelnut flavour products. Inability to
track products in this way would lead to the wholesale withdrawal of a
product line, with disastrous consequences for the manufacturer's profits.
The production planning process involves ensuring that enough goods are
produced to meet forward orders for a period, without running out or
becoming overstocked. The effect of this flows back to the beginning of the
process. You must take delivery of enough raw materials to ensure that your
production lines do not stop for the want of a component, but that your
parts inventory does not overwhelm your storage and financial resources.
Moreover, your suppliers must be able to schedule their production processes
to ensure that you are supplied with goods at the right time and in the
right quantity.
The first MRP systems did not cater for this requirement. They were able to
extrapolate need based on orders and schedules. Purchasing managers had to
ensure that the correct quantities were ordered at the correct time.
With MRP II systems, the interface between the outside world - suppliers and
customers - and the manufacturing system is automated. The system is driven
by sales order processing. Customers' future ordering requirements are
entered into the system. These are exploded into component parts, and a
schedule of raw materials is built up. At this time the system may be
dealing with estimates in the form of future ordering requirements from
component suppliers. From these will be generated similar forecasts all the
way back to the suppliers of the basic raw products.
Once the sales order becomes firm, the manufacturer can call off goods from
his suppliers, based on the schedule - with whatever variations might be
needed to suit actual needs.
If the MRP system is sufficiently advanced, all this can be automated. Sales
orders, once input, can automatically drive the whole process. Using
electronic document interchange (EDI) no further human intervention should
be needed after the input of a customer order. All intermediate
documentation right down the chain of suppliers can be automatically
produced.
The need for standards for data interchange is obvious, and there are a
number in use. In the motor industry there is Odette, other standards
include ANSI X12 and Edufact. These define the form and contents of
documents and electronic packages.
Some suppliers of manufacturing software, such as Istel, a subsidiary of A T
&amp; T, point to the importance of the open systems movement. However,
according to Mr Alan Topliss, of Price Waterhouse, their robustness,
security and ability to handle the very large amounts of data needed, are
still not considered sufficient by many users.
The most advanced use of MRP, mainly for companies producing in relatively
low numbers is Just In Time (Jit) manufacturing. The idea is to produce
goods only when they are needed - rather than stockpiling them. The
ramifications flow right back down the chain. You must be able to call off
ordered parts from your suppliers in the same fashion. A motor manufacturer,
for example, may only keep a small stock of wheels - perhaps two hours'
supply. In these circumstances, you need not only to forecast your numbers,
but also how long it will take to deliver them.
It is logical to drive shop floor control systems from MRP. However, as Mr
Tony Baggot of EDS points out, you need a competent 'systems integrator' who
understands how to link together all the disparate components. 'It's not
just a matter of connecting machines up, they must share the same protocols'
he stresses.
The automation of manufacturing is an area in which not only machines, but
also the operations of companies become interlinked. The benefits are
obvious, but the complexity calls for careful adherence to standards.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (7): Academia and
industry forge tighter links - Research &amp; Development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL KENWARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BILL Hillier joined the Science and Engineering Research Council (Serc) six
years ago 'to see if I could help to get academia to work with industry'. He
moved from industry, Racal Redac, where he worked on computer-aided design,
to become the co-ordinator of the Acme research programme at the Serc's
headquarters in Swindon.
Acme stands for Applications of Computers in Manufacturing. Serc invests
about Pounds 7m a year through Acme in projects in universities and
polytechnics in Britain. These projects cover the whole range of computing
in manufacturing, from work on the control of robots, for example, through
computer-aided design to production management.
Mr Hillier says 'Acme activities emphasise research at universities into
real problems that are industrially relevant.' The R &amp; D is not, though,
day-to-day trouble shooting. Industry does not expect academia researchers
to provide immediate answers to short-term problems. Mr Hillier says that
Acme hopes to support research that will deliver useful results within two
to five years.
In all, Acme supports something like 135 projects. These range from small
grants for visiting fellowship to large clubs with industry. The largest
grants are for about Pounds 350,000 for three years.
Serc launched the Acme programme six years ago. Since then it has awarded
grants worth a total that is approaching Pounds 40m. The work, on about 400
projects, is in four main areas; advanced production machines,
computer-aided engineering, manufacturing processes, and planning and
management.
In each Acme project, the Serc expects academic institutions to work closely
with industrial partners. Industry may contribute financially to a project -
it adds an average 15 per cent to the Serc's contribution - but in many
cases, industry's contribution is not so much financial as in time and other
resources. For example, companies sometimes provide materials for processing
in university projects.
Acme's projects cover a wide range of industries. For example, the Control
and Robotics Group, part of the Department of Electronic Engineering at the
university of Hull, is involved in several projects with the shoe and
garment industries. The aim of this research is to develop automated
manufacturing processes.
In one research project at Hull, the group is developing a robotic work cell
to assemble complete garments, in this case underpants. Each cell would have
seven or eight machines performing a particular task on a garment before
passing it on to the next stage.
In the cell, robot vision system would recognise the parts and tell the
machines what to do with them. A big problem with textiles is that the parts
are flexible. This makes it difficult for an optical system to recognise the
shape. 'Pick up a dishcloth and it doesn't look like a rectangle at all,'
says Dr Gaynor Taylor, a researcher in the group.
The industrial collaborator is Corah, a garment manufacturer that supplies
Marks and Spencer. The ultimate aim of this work is to develop a production
cell that can receive cut parts at one end and deliver finished garments
from the other. In their research, the Hull group analyses the production
process a step at a time.
Another series of projects brings together researchers from the universities
of Durham and Hull. Their industrial collaborator is British United Shoe
Machinery (BUSM).
Here the step-by-step approach is even more important because companies
making shoes are not accustomed to investing large amounts in machinery. So
the projects set out to automate individual steps of shoe production, with a
particular emphasis on preparing the parts and sewing them together before
they go on the final manufacturing stages.
The aim of the project is not to develop prototype machines, says Mr Taylor.
It is up to the machinery makers to develop commercial equipment.
The research at Durham and Hull has concentrated on the use of electronic
vision and image recognition equipment and other technologies to develop
manufacturing and handling processes that do not have to be altered every
time a company changes the style of the shoes that it is making.
Mr David Reedman is on the receiving end of this research. He is manager of
research for BUSM. 'Universities and polytechnics are very good at research
but not at product development,' he says.
Mr Reedman believes that projects with academic researchers can tell a
manufacturer if a particular piece of technology will work in its industry.
'I ask 'Can I use this technology in Shoe making?'' he says. 'A research
project which establishes quickly and efficiently that a new technology is
unsuitable is just as successful, if not as acceptable, as one with a more
positive outcome.'
'What you get out of the university research is usually a model that
demonstrates some principle,' says Mr Reedman. It is then down to
development engineers to turn the idea into commercial products. Earlier
this month at a trade show in Germany, BUSM showed a prototype shoe
stitching machine based on its work with the university research teams.
Over the past five years, BUSM has benefited from grants totalling almost
Pounds 450,000 for work at the two universities. 'I don't see how we can
survive without the research,' says Mr Reedman.
Acme supports a range of projects in the general area of computer aided
design. Dr Bob Cripps at the university of Birmingham, works on the computer
modelling of surfaces and how they behave in various manufacturing
processes. One such project involved collaboration with Austin Rover on a
phenomenon know as springback.
When a piece of flat steel is pressed into a complex shape, a car bonnet for
example, it takes up the exact shape of the press. But remove the pressure
and the shape changes slightly. In the past, getting the right shape was
more a black art than a science, according to Dr Bob Cripps who worked on
the project.
The Birmingham team computerised the whole process of design manufacture of
complex components in an attempt to understand the phenomenon of springback.
The idea was to be able to predict exactly how much of a change in shape a
component would experience as it came out of a press.
The work at Birmingham achieved its goal, the researchers could predict the
amount of springback that would occur. However, in the process of
computerising the manufacturing process, the problem of springback lessened.
Another task facing manufacturers is to move products around in factories.
In another Acme project, Professor Mike Brady of Oxford University has
developed an automatic sensing system that can guide an unmanned vehicle
around a factory.
This Pounds 250,000 project, with four industrial collaborators including
GEC and Thorn-EMI, has resulted in the development of a vehicle equipped
with a laser-rangefinder and ultrasonic position detection. Sensors feed
information into an on-board computer that can then pick a route around
unexpected obstacles.
Computerised hardware is an essential part of any manufacturing system.
There are, however, other issues facing the manufacturer who wants to
introduce new technology. This too is an area for academic research. Mr Mike
Gregory is pioneering a new area of research - for academia at least.
There is nothing new about research on the technology of manufacturing,
engineering departments have been doing it since their beginnings.
Researchers have also studied the social impacts of new manufacturing
technology on the workplace, but they have yet to look seriously at the
management of manufacturing.
Mr Gregory believes that before a company can develop a manufacturing
strategy, it needs to undertake a manufacturing audit. Companies need to
design manufacturing systems that meet their business requirements. To
achieve this, he says, 'We need more research into the interface between
organisations and technology'.
More research is only of value if the results reach industry. Mr Gregory's
work has led to a booklet called Competitive Manufacturing, that is
published by the Department of Trade and Industry. There are, though, gaps
in the flow of information from R &amp; D on computers in manufacturing.
The government's Advisory Council on Science and Technology (Acost)
highlighted these gaps in its recent report called Advanced Manufacturing
Technology. The report drew attention to the lack of co-ordination in the
various activities in advanced manufacturing technology (AMT). 'The
aggregation of the dispersed knowledge of AMT in the UK, both industrial and
academic, together with the acquisition of international experience, can
offer individual companies a valuable new resource,' says the report.
Professor Lionel Maunder of the university of Newcastle, chairman of Acost's
Engineering Technologies Committee, hopes that this report will lead to the
creation of local centres where industry can seek information on advanced
manufacturing technologies. It has prompted the DTI to enter into discussion
with the Science and Engineering Research Council on the issue.
Unfortunately, the Acme programme has been hit by the shortage of funds
facing the Serc. The programme has to find savings of some 15 per cent. This
will inevitably put pressure on the DTI's own R &amp; D programmes.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (8): Paperless trading
offers single market opportunities - EDI, the switch gathers pace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE BLACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANUFACTURING companies have identified EDI (electronic data interchange, or
paperless trading) as potentially one of their most effective weapons in the
battle for survival.
Hundreds of British manufacturing companies are beginning to feel the
benefits of cutting out bureaucracy and dealing via computer to place
orders, send invoices and make payments.
Some British manufacturers believe that they could derive significant
advantages from EDI when the single European market is fully operational.
The UK is well advanced in EDI compared to other European countries because
of the development of standards by the Article Number Association and the
Simpler Trading Procedures Board and because of value-added network services
created in the wake of telecommunications deregulation.
The ANA developed Tradacoms, the UK standard for trading communications, in
1982. This gave birth to services such as Tradanet offered by International
Network Services (INS), the EDI supplier co-owned by ICL and General
Electric Information Services of the US. About 1,500 UK manufacturers do
business via Tradanet.
As companies search for ways of improving their business operations, they
have realised that many changes will be dependent on direct
computer-to-computer links with their suppliers and customers.
In particular, Jit (just in time manufacturing, a manufacturing philosophy
which has spread from Japan across the world in the past 10 years) can only
work properly on an EDI infrastructure.
This represents a considerable change of attitude from the early days of
EDI, when it was seen simply as a cost-cutting technique. Now the emphasis
has moved from saving money to providing a better service to customers
through swifter response to demand and more competitive prices.
Supply chain management is the centre of attention. Members of the supply
chain comprise what has been called a virtual organisation.
This involves a new way of thinking about the whole production process.
For example, in a virtual organisation it is possible to cut out duplication
of quality assurance.
Components which have been rigorously tested by the maker to his customer's
standards are not re-tested on arrival at the customer but go directly into
stock or, better still, straight into production.
When component makers receive their orders and confirm delivery
electronically, production scheduling can be more tightly controlled. The
result can be shrinking lead times and stock is sharply reduced or
eliminated.
Not surprisingly, the vanguard of EDI users is to be found in sectors which
are technologically-oriented. The electronics business began the switch in
1987.
Leaders in that field, such as ICL, have progressed in the last three years
to using EDI on an international scale to deal with component suppliers in
the US and continental Europe.
NCR uses EDI to exchange forecast demands regularly with its trading
partners in a Jit environment. Texas Instruments makes a point of its EDI
capability in its marketing slogan which insists it is 'better to do
business with'.
Telecommunications manufacturers are becoming keen EDI adherents. Mitel, the
Canadian private branch exchange (PBX) maker which is 51 per cent owned by
British Telecom, is in the process of converting.
It expects to have over 30 of its suppliers communicating via computer by
the end of the year for purchase orders. This will be followed by accepting
invoices from suppliers electronically and then by paying them through the
BACS banking network.
Mr Jeremy Arnold, Mitel's EDI co-ordinator says that although cost-saving is
important the main aim is to establish better long-term partnerships and cut
lead times in production.
The automotive sector is another which is taking up EDI rapidly, led by
leading manufacturers including Rover, Peugeot-Talbot, Citroen and Renault.
This sector, like others, has its own EDI user support group, called Odette,
which is active in eight European countries and is run in the UK by the
Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.
According to Ms Kerry Shipley, its project manager, there are over 400 EDI
user companies in the automotive business in the UK.
This represents a high proportion of the leading companies but she notes
that their use of EDI is still restricted to a few functions such as
invoicing and delivery instructions.
She expects to see a steady expansion in the number of types of message sent
between members in the next five years.
At the same time there may be a second wave of recruits to Odette as many
smaller companies will be compelled by their larger customers to take up
EDI.
The big companies are not officially making EDI mandatory for their trading
partners, but they are stressing that an EDI capability is one of the
criteria for becoming a preferred supplier.
Other EDI user groups serving specific sectors include Cefic for chemical
companies and Edifice for electronics companies.
Aerospace is another area in which large manufacturers are driving EDI down
to small suppliers.
British Aerospace, for example, keen to adopt a Jit approach, has begun
using EDI not just with its production partners but with suppliers of other
goods and services too.
The laggard in EDI is still government.
Manufacturers which supply ministries and local authorities are still
generally unable to communicate with them electronically.
However, even in this area there are signs of movement; the number of
suppliers dealing electronically with the National Health Service has risen
to over 250.
Mr Patrick Tonks, marketing manager for INS, says that large companies have
been putting a lot of effort into winning over their trading partners to the
EDI method.
Rather than simply imposing a rule that all business with them must be done
electronically in future, they are holding seminars to persuade them of the
benefits of the new systems.
In the long term there is little doubt that any large or medium-sized
company in manufacturing must go over to EDI.
How long it will take is uncertain, but the trend is certainly accelerating;
and it is one of the bright spots of the computer industry which must give
it hope in its present time of crisis.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (6): Fuzzy logic and
robots spell technological advantage - Japan, modifying production
philosophies as emphasis shifts back to the human workforce
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IT seemed laughable at the time: a couple years ago a Japanese manufacturer
replaced some factory line workers with automation machinery, then set up
full-sized cardboard human dummies to keep the remaining workers from
getting lonely.
The completely workerless factory is a decade away, but there are a few
showcase examples including Fanuc, the machine tool manufacturer's factory
near Mount Fuji, where robots make robots. But until no-human factories are
realised on a broad scale, factory automation system makers will focus their
research on bridging the awkward interaction between humans and the ever
increasing number of machines working by their side.
In past years manufacturers put the emphasis on installing labour-saving
machines to raise production. They focused on maximising the use of people,
money, time and materials, and humans had to find a way to fit in with the
complex machinery beginning to surround them.
'Until now humans have had to adapt to use machines, so the man-machine
interface was not well matched,' says Mr Hiroshi Matsuyama, a manager at
Omron the programmable controller maker in Tokyo.
'Japanese industry is now modifying its philosophy. The centre of production
has shifted to human workers, and computers should be matched with humans,'
he says. That means designing new software that allows production machinery
to be more easily used and changed quickly for different jobs. For example,
welding or insertion and using artificial intelligence techniques such as
fuzzy logic to help robots and computers make better decisions, such as
finding an operational failure, through inferences, as humans do.
The escalating skilled labour shortage, brought about by a declining birth
rate and a more affluent and highly educated society, makes robots an
important component of factory automation, a do-or-die decision for some
companies.
Strong competition in industries such as shipping has resulted in waves of
investment in labour-saving technology such as steel and aluminium cutting
tools, processing machines and welding robots. The rise in the labour force
is expected to be 0.8 per cent a year until 1993, then it is likely to fall
off by half to 0.4 per cent until 2000, according to Japanese government
statistics. During that time Japan expects to keep about a 4 per cent annual
economic growth rate.
'To achieve this it is necessary to introduce automation technology,' says
Mr Kanji Yonemoto, vice-chairman of the Japan Industrial Robot Association
(Jira) in Tokyo. An even more remarkable shift in Japan's economy is the
switch from a manufacturing to a service economy.
Jobs in services pay better. Mr Yonemoto says there will be 1.5m fewer
blue-collar workers in manufacturing by 2000 than in 1989, when there was a
shortage of 715,800 people. Today's young people are a different breed of
worker from those who laboured long hours for little pay to build Japan's
industrial miracle.
They want to avoid so-called '3K' work: 'kiken' (dangerous), 'kitanai'
(dirty) and 'kitsui' (hard). 'Older men were very patient and had the
Bushido (warrior) morale, but it is hard to find these people today,' says
Mr Matsuyama.
Replacing them with machinery takes time and money. Omron, which produces
programmable controllers and other electronics products, sees the
improvements that can be made in factory automation as almost limitless and
including diagnosing system failures and other management tasks.
The improvements span a broad factory automation market valued at almost
Y2,000bn and covering every aspect of making a product from design through
production and inspection. The important components of automating a factory
are numerical controllers, the largest chunk of the market, as well as
computer-aided design and manufacturing software and equipment, industrial
robots, programmable controllers, automated warehouses, computers and
automatic guided vehicles that transport products throughout a plant site.
Japan leads the world in both producing and using these production
components. It has replaced Germany as the biggest exporter of machine
tools, an important indicator of industrial development and economic power.
Japan has an estimated 23 per cent of the world market compared to the 16
per cent held by Germany.
Five Japanese companies are making machine tools in Europe. Mazak Yamazaki,
for example, has a Dollars 50m factory in Worcester, in the UK which
produces some 100 computer-controlled machines a month, according to
industry estimates. Japan's worldwide share of the fast-growing robot market
is even more impressive: it has 57.5 per cent of the robot installations
worldwide, with western Europe having 14.5 per cent and the US 9.5 per cent.
Japan's main advantages are that workers in automotive, electronics and
other factories are accustomed to and readily accept automation technology,
product demand is still strong in the home market, and Japanese
manufacturers make most of the machines they use for automation, so there is
little competition from imports.
The electronics industry is the biggest user of automation technology. At
its Ome design and manufacturing works west of Tokyo, Toshiba uses its own
laptop computers for design, development and assembly of new Toshiba
laptops.
The laptops are used to compute how easily a new computer model can be
assembled by a line of 12 workers, who can slap together one notebook-size
Dynabook computer in a few minutes. That's important, because the company is
making about 1m laptops a year at Ome, and the life span of each new product
is getting increasingly shorter amid hot competition.
'Often it's the case with some products that the effective life span is
already over by the time it goes to the market place,' says Mr Masao Suga,
who heads the personal computer research and development department at Ome.
However, the shortening product life spans, which run from six months for a
Japanese word processor to about three years for laptops, made it
increasingly difficult for Toshiba to continue using robots. Toshiba
replicates about 70 per cent of design work from current models in new ones.
While it took Toshiba three years to develop the T3100 and J3100 laptops
from scratch, it took only nine months to design the smaller-size Dynabook.
Though its factory is about 70-80 per cent automated, visitors to the
company often comment about the number of people still present on the
manufacturing lines, but Mr Suga says that with the fast-paced product life
cycles, humans are needed. 'There are problems with automated systems. They
can't catch up with new technology, so humans are acting as universal super
robots,' he adds.
Fuzzy logic may help close the gap. Mr Yonemoto of Jira says fuzzy logic,
software that can help make a decision from unclear information, will help
increase the versatility of robots in the future by affording better control
of their movements. Omron, a leader in using fuzzy technology, has developed
a test robot that can grasp soft or fragile items, such as tofu (bean curd).
In a New Year's address to employees, Mr Yoshio Tateisi, company president,
identified fuzzy logic as an important research area for the 1990s. By 1994,
more than 20 per cent of Omron's product line will include some type of
fuzzy logic. According to Mr Matsuyama, fuzzy logic has many benefits. As
part of a computer-integrated manufacturing (Cim) system it can be used in
production and in managing the company.
'Another merit of fuzzy technology is to replace a person where computers
are hard to use, for example, controlling a nuclear power generation plant's
circulation control system to clean water and to make decisions. Perhaps the
Chernobyl or Mihama plant accidents could have been avoided with these
systems,' he says.
Fuzzy logic, along with more flexible robots and other components, spell
another technological advantage for Japan in the future: being able to
change small-scale production quickly, so that multiple products can be
produced on the same factory line in one day. Mr Matsuyama predicts Japanese
manufacturers will become very good at this small-scale production, which is
a difficult technology demanding ultimate flexibility.
Computerisation would be all the more necessary in production in the sense
that market information should be more effectively connected with the
production process or with the factory itself. But large-scale flexible
production without man will take 8-10 years says Matsushita Electric in
Osaka.
The company believes fuzzy logic, along with neurocomputing technology which
more closely mimics the human brain, will be the main technologies once they
are refined.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (5): Group offers a
lesson to its suppliers - Profile of Case Communications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE PALFRAMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT the end of last month Case Communications, the Dowty subsidiary that
makes modems, multiplexors and other data communications products, called
together 80 of its leading suppliers.
It was less than happy about the quality of some of the components it was
receiving and their late arrival. Having spent three years radically and
sometimes painfully overhauling its own manufacturing facilities, Case would
now like its suppliers to do the same.
The company has not issued an ultimatum. With a turnover of just under
Pounds 100m a year it is not big enough to insist on improvements from its
suppliers. Nor would Case's ingrained corporate culture of co-operation and
team-working allow it to contemplate such a move.
The fact remains, however, that Case will reduce the number of suppliers it
uses in the coming years.
The company is no longer willing to spend money testing goods it has
purchased to make sure they perform to specification. Similarly, it does not
want to have to stock large amounts of goods because only 60 per cent are
delivered on time.
Mr Alex Kachellek, the company's manufacturing director, says that Case
delivers 95 per cent of its products on time. Three years ago the figure was
55 per cent. Four years ago the company's performance was not measured. It
was sufficient to know that monthly revenue targets were being met and that
the company was making a profit.
Under these comfortable conditions, the sweeping changes that Mr Kachellek
proposed in 1988 were met with many raised eyebrows.
Even the six-person team he set up to implement the changes had at least one
dissenter at the outset. Apart from improving delivery, Mr Kachellek wanted
to make-to-order (rather than to forecast) and in the shortest time
possible. The first step, he declared, would be to reduce lead times from
six weeks or more to 15 days.
As a youngish electronics manufacturer, Case had a solid foundation for the
structural changes Mr Kachellek sought. The company understood computers and
communication products. They were its business.
All 1,200 people employed at its Watford headquarters could use and had
access to computer terminals. The terminals were networked so that
information generated on its manufacturing resources planning system flowed
electronically from sales via manufacturing to despatch.
From the start Case fostered flexibility among its people.
Divisive practices were shunned in favour of free-for-all parking, a single
canteen and monthly pay cheques. Team working and team problem-solving were
encouraged.
Against all this was the threat posed by competitors in the quickly-changing
electronics industry in the Asia Pacific region.
Case brings out about one new product every month and the life cycle of
these products is only 10 months to two years. Margins are thin.
Case had the advantage of a reputation for product quality but knew it had
to offer its customers speedy and reliable delivery or they would go
elsewhere.
Mr Kachellek is convinced that without the changes he started, Case would be
sub-contracting much of its manufacture to Asia Pacific. Only a small amount
has been sub-contracted and, as manufacturing has improved, some of that is
likely to brought back to the UK.
Case's products are turned out in nine days. Work in progress on the factory
floor is worth about Pounds 300,000 compared with 10 times that amount three
years ago. In other words, the factory is much easier to control.
Mr Kachellek insists that his managers and staff in the factory solved most
of Case's manufacturing problems. Like many manufacturers these days, he
downplays the role of technology.
There have been no large additions to its manufacturing management system in
the past three years, nor has there been large scale automation of the
shop-floor.
Case's biggest single investment in this period of change was the Pounds
22,000 it spent on a machine to insert integrated circuits into a printed
circuit board.
'You don't have to spend lots of money on information technology,' says Mr
Kachellek. 'It is easy to take the technology too far and we've done that in
the past. Manufacturing should be simple and we all need to be reminded of
that.'
Since 1988 Case has switched from a centrally run and organised factory to a
distributed one. Again it is becoming the fashionable thing to do in
manufacturing and it is supported by a similar move from central to
distributed computing.
Case has separate areas for making printed circuit boards, cables, final
products and technical documentation. Each has its own stores. Office-bound
production planners no longer tell the factory floor what to make and when.
Supervisors decide their own schedule to meet the delivery dates given by
the planners.
This way of working has reduced lead times and late deliveries but, stresses
Mr Kachellek, more was needed to reduce manufacturing costs.
Just over 70 people were made redundant three years ago. Since then a
further 150 people in manufacturing have left Case and not been replaced.
Only 150 people remain in manufacturing.
In the year to the end of March, Case reckons that its revenues have
increased by about 15 per cent and that it is one of the few profitable
companies in the data communications business.
Mr Kachellek makes no claims about manufacturing's part in this performance.
He is not sure if Case's customers are satisfied but he knows he is not.
Manufacturing improvements will continue at Case and, Mr Kachellek hopes, at
its suppliers.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (4): A happy band of
users is most important - Justifying the investment, hardware mistakes
prompt need for greater prudence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE PALFRAMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANUFACTURING industry, in particular in the UK, has made large errors in
buying computer hardware and software.
It is not alone. Other sectors, such as retailing and finance, have also
made their fair share of mistakes. However, with hindsight, manufacturing
should to be able to invest more prudently. There are signs that this is
happening.
The biggest breakthrough for medium-sized and large manufacturers has been
recognising what is needed for a successful computer system. It matters
little how rigorously the investment is justified or which manufacturing
system is chosen.
What is important, and obviously so, is having a happy group of users in
sales, purchasing, on the shop-floor and throughout the rest of the
organisation.
Users are likely to be more satisfied if they are allowed to decide what
they want from a system and are then involved in its selection and, finally,
are trained in its use. The steps are simple. They always have been but,
until recently, they have been by-passed.
The reasons are complex but boil down to money and power. The justification
for spending large sums on computer systems was much easier than it is
today. In the past, computers were mainly labour-saving devices and the cost
benefits could be calculated quickly.
Now manufacturers want computer systems that are integrated and intelligent.
They want the vast amount of information that they have collected on their
mainframe machines to be accessible to management to give an up-to-date
picture of the company's performance that can be viewed in any amount of
detail.
'These are big projects where many of the benefits are intangible and it is
very hard to put numbers on them,' says Mr Roderick Roy, a partner with
Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte's manufacturing consulting group. 'Companies have
to weigh up the risk of not doing it,' he adds.
For very complex projects some large manufacturers are turning to financial
modelling to determine the impact of their investment on the business.
This is a lengthy process but there are PC-based computer programs to help
and, if these fail, the decision-makers have access to another well-used
method of investment justification. The method is described delicately as
business acumen or, more coarsely, as gut-feel.
Whether the project is small or large, the most common failing in
manufacturing is to underestimate the cost of implementation.
Typically, manufacturing systems for controlling inventory or production
take a year or two before they are fully up and running. During that time
the project has to be managed and people trained. Often neither happens to a
great enough extent.
Investment in information technology should be equalled by the investment in
implementation, insists Mr Alan Toplis, a partner with Price Waterhouse.
'If anyone tells you it is less, don't believe them. I've seen companies
driven to the brink of bankruptcy because they couldn't implement their
systems,' he says.
Power or the corporate pecking order has also stopped users getting what
they want. Data processing departments, historically, have been closer to
the financial director than production and, therefore, have had considerable
influence on a company's computer strategy.
Much of the time they have dictated what hardware was needed and what
software they would develop. When they were only responsible for jobs such
as payroll, pensions and sales order processing, it was of minor concern to
people running the factory.
All that changed when the processing departments started developing
manufacturing resources planning packages for their mainframe computers.
They were convinced that these packages could cut the cost of manufacture by
reducing, among other things, inventory, work-in-progress and lead times.
Some of these systems have been successful. However, many have not.
Mr Brian Entwistle, general manager of British Aerospace's software
development arm, BAeCam, blames the processing department's liking for
mainframes which could not (and still cannot) process information fast
enough for it to reflect the realities on the shop-floor.
A parallel argument is that the department should not have been trying to
computerise the complexities of the shop-floor. Rather that manufacturing
should have simplified its operations first.
So the divide between the processing department and manufacturing has been
created.
It has been maintained by the large computer suppliers which have the ears
of important people in the processing department and a vested interest in
expanding the centralised mainframe strategy.
It has also been supported by top management which operated, like the
computer systems, in an hierarchical manner.
Bridging the gulf has been a lengthy job. It required people to admit they
had made mistakes and management to take back the control of its computer
systems' investments which it had relinquished to the processing department.
Some manufacturers have quietly done this.
However, the numbers that are clinging to the old way are sufficiently large
for disaster stories to abound.
Most of the tales of woe have a common theme: in-house software development.
The issue is rarely whether or not the spending was justified and benefits
enumerated.
Almost always it is the processing department's insistence that
manufacturing's requirements can only be met by bespoke software.
For most commercial and basic manufacturing applications there is now 'very
little justification for developing your own software', says Mr Toplis.
Generic packages typically match about 80 per cent of a company's
requirements. The most up-to-date packages can then be tailored (in
consultation with the users) to deliver much or all of the rest.
'They work,' says Mr Roy. 'They also strip years off the implementation
process which pulls all the benefits forward.'
If manufacturing is to get any satisfaction from its computer investments
the relationship between the board, the processing department and users,
especially in the factory, must change.
It is fashionable to knock the company's information technology people
(sometimes rightly so) for their dictatorial attitude. But, equally, the
people running the factory have been silent in their suffering.
The processing department should offer a service to the users and 'provide a
framework in which they can operate', says Mr Roy. Users should be prepared
to be more vocal about what they want and their working procedures.
Management should minimise the fear of change and of admitting mistakes
among its staff.
'More than ever it is important for manufacturers to learn from the past,
says Mr Roy.
Formal audits after a computer system has been running for a couple of years
will pinpoint what has and has not been achieved (from the users'
perspective).
They have not been favoured in the past, again because people were reluctant
to reveal the reality of their decisions. But, as the rate of change of
computer technology quickens, manufacturers can guarantee that they will be

Armed with this type of information and a multi-disciplined working group

FT  14 MAY 91 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (3): Cadcam market is
expected to rise to Dollars 26.2bn by 1995 - Computer-Aided Design, slower
growth but healthy

   THE world market for Cadcam
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
computer-aided design and manufacturing equipment - may be slowing down, but
many users in manufacturing industry would give their eye teeth to match the
growth rates projected for suppliers over the next few years.
After the phenomenal growth of the early 1980s, the industry is expanding at
rates of a mere 10-14 per cent a year, depending on the sector. According to
Dataquest, the US market research company, the total Cadcam market was worth
Dollars 13.9bn last year, but this is forecast to rise to Dollars 26.2bn by
1995.
Most big Western manufacturing companies have Cadcam systems, although the
level of maturity and sophistication varies from one country or industrial
sector to another. While this means that some markets will see only
incremental growth, there is little doubt that customers with successful
installations are keen to come back and buy more.
Much of the growth in the next few years, therefore, will come from a
combination of new products and new applications to tempt long-standing
users, and new customers.
In the latter category some UK machine tool companies, for example, are only
now replacing their draughtsman's tables with Cad systems, partly because
the cost of the hardware is falling but also because their clients demand
it. As with robotics, the use of Cadcam is spreading to smaller
manufacturing companies, and particularly the subcontractors in the
automotive and aerospace industries.
Mr Roger Smedley, chairman of the UK engineering design company Ricardo
International, remarks that 10 years ago it was hard to spend more than
Pounds 1,000 per head in capital on each employee's drawing board, desk and
chair.
Now, with some computer screens costing up to Pounds 60,000 including
software, capital expenditure per head has rocketed, but an enormous number
of design companies have gone out of business because they could not finance
a switch to computers or make it work, says Mr Smedley. Ricardo is spending
Pounds 1.5m a year on computers, while one of its rivals, Worthing-based
International Automotive Design, has just ordered an Pounds 800,000 CADDS 4X
system from Computervision, enhancing its ability to provide design, build
and prototyping services to big automotive manufacturers.
IAD has been a customer of Computervision, one of the world's leading Cadcam
suppliers, for six years. Mr Mark Holmes, a UK marketing consultant for
Computervision, notes that manufacturers such as Rover and Ford are asking
their supplier companies to ensure their Cadcam systems are compliant - a
trend that is being driven by the desire for concurrent engineering (design
for manufacturing.)
Computervision, part of Prime Computer, is one of a handful of big players
in an industry which continues to see new niche products and companies
emerging, and thus boasts dozens of companies with revenues so small that
they hardly register at all. Most of these are US companies, followed by
European groups, with Japan back in third place.
Industry observers see a continuing role for the smaller companies, even if
sometimes it is only for their technology to be obtained by the larger
players, through an OEM arrangement or acquisition.
An example of the latter was the acquisition by Computervision of
Massachusetts-based Premise, whose technology extends Cadcam back to the
sketching, or back-of-an-envelope stage in the creation of a design. This
process, known as conceptual engineering, is generating widespread interest
among manufacturers.
There have been takeovers of a different kind. The squeeze on margins in the
late 1980s, caused by the rush into the market in the hope of fat profits,
has left several companies by the wayside.
The electronic design automation (EDA) sector in particular experienced
particular turmoil during this period: Daisy Systems bought Cadnetics in
1988 to form Dazix, but a heavy burden of debt led to its bankruptcy filing
in August. In January, the much stronger US company Intergraph snapped up
Dazix for Dollars 14m.
If the established companies play their cards right, they ought to be able
to avoid Dazix's fate. There are significant opportunities in many
geographic and product markets, and the big suppliers with marketing muscle
are best placed to exploit them.
Mr Jim Tully, Dataquest's UK Cadcam analyst, sees Europe maintaining its 35
per cent share of the world market through to 1995. Germany is already the
biggest market, but still offers the best growth potential because of
reunification. Reconstruction, refitting of factories and a modernised power
network all offer scope for Cadcam sales.
Dataquest predicts the more mature US market will see its share slip from 35
per cent in 1990 to 33 per cent in 1995, while Asia will maintain its 28 per
cent share.
In product sectors, Mr Tully sees the fastest growth in the geographic
information systems (GIS) sector, where Intergraph is the undisputed leader.
'There's a great deal of interest in getting maps on to computer systems,'
he says.
The mechanical sector, which is by far the largest, is growing very slowly,
but even here there are opportunities. In particular, users in this sector
are interested in so-called knowledge-based applications of Cadcam. An
example is a system developed by the small US supplier Rasna, which will
design products such as car bumpers virtually automatically, minimising
weight and performing stress analysis on the basis of a few parameters and
criteria.
Two other trends look like becoming increasingly significant for the
industry. Until recently, most Cadcam systems have been mutually
incompatible, and end-users wishing to change their system have faced a
difficult and costly process. This, says Mr Tully, is changing, because of
'frameworks,' a set of software facilities that allows third-party Cadcam to
be integrated into a user's existing system, or a supplier's product line.
'The whole issue of opening the systems up is the key to a lift to growth,'
he says.
Mr Holmes at Computervision sees another market place opening up -
engineering data management.
Cadcam, he says, was a reasonably controlled environment in the early 1980s
with the host mainframes looking after files. But as engineering companies
have been forced to move more quickly, it has become more important to find
where information resides in a company.
Changing technology has meant that Cadcam is more likely to be based on a
workstation, leading to a proliferation of files, and the need for EDM to
control data more closely.
There is probably no better way of assessing the industry's prospects than
to examine new uses for Cadcam. At Boeing, the introduction of a new
generation of Cad tools is aimed at eliminating the risk of design mistakes.
The lynch-pin is Catia, a three-dimensional Cad programme supplied by
Dassault Systems of France, which incorporates a new stress analysis system.
Linked to a network of IBM workstations and mainframes, Catia will enable
Boeing's new 777 commercial jet to be the first designed completely on
computer.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (2):  Confusion over
the levels of integration and flexibility - Intelligent Machine Tools, a
different approach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN the beginning there were machine tools, the workhorses of every
mechanical engineering workshop in the world, which are used for cutting,
grinding and shaping lumps of metal to form components for all sorts of
industrial products or machinery.
Then, over the past 25 years, came numerical control and computer numerical
control (CNC), in the form of user-friendly units attached to the machine
tool which can be part-programmed on line by the operator or off-line in the
production engineering office.
Hand-in-hand with the CNC units, whose software can control almost any type
of machine tool, new designs of machine produced the higher precision,
stiffness and stability to take advantage of the greater accuracy that CNC
offers.
CNC, when applied to single machine tools, is well-established, and more
than 80 per cent of Japanese machine tools are numerically-controlled. The
units are powerful enough to control 'machining centres', which can often do
the work of eight or more standard machine tools, and may contain more than
100 different cutting tools.
As the cost of computing power has come down, the economics of computer
memory storage have been transformed, and CNC units can store and recall
hundreds of different instructions for a great variety of workpieces.
From the mid-1980s, further developments in CNC technology have produced the
concept of a 'flexible manufacturing system' (FMS), two or more machining
centres linked and coupled under the control of a host computer. The
important word is 'flexible,' according to the UK Machine Tool Technologies
Association: 'The combined power of the machine and host computer, and their
storage memories, is enough to manufacture all prescribed varieties of work,
in any order.'
FMS is now being being linked to computer-aided design and production
control to produce manufacturing industry's Holy Grail, Computer Integrated
Manufacturing (Cim).
The aim is to link 'islands of automation' on the factory floor with all the
other computerised functions of the manufacturing process, such as
purchasing, ordering, stock control and is proving to be a tougher challenge
than many in the computer industry had predicted only three years ago.
Put at its simplest, there appears to be considerable confusion among
manufacturers about how integrated their approach to Cim should be, or how
flexible their use of FMS. The situation is not helped by a proliferation of
computer suppliers, all keen to sell their product but varying in their
commitment to service and support.
Dr Norman Schofield, director of engineering and systems at PA Consulting
Group, says there are very good technical reasons why Cim has been difficult
for many companies to achieve.
Companies had believed that, to stay competitive, they needed to buy the
best available computers for each of the many different disciplines in the
manufacturing process - packaging, software, documentation, electronics and
mechanical engineering.
This, in turn, increased the size and complexity of the 'data package'
describing the product, and spread the data over many systems.
In one recent assignment, PA found 41 different applications used in a
company's design/engineering process alone, on six different computer
platforms, on 10 sites in three countries.
The problem for the manufacturer, says Dr Schofield, is whether it is going
to get independent advice from any of its computer suppliers if it wishes to
integrate its systems. PA has attempted to help clients through the maze by
building its own Cim centre using four computers and 12 software
applications from nine different suppliers.
The aim is to illustrate the many elements involved in applying Cim to the
relatively simple task of putting parts on to printed circuit boards.
Dr Schofield believes that open systems will be the key to developing
progress towards Cim, and says most computer vendors are prepared to accept
the inevitability of an open environment.
'Manufacturers are getting a lot more help from suppliers, which is all
leading to easier integration.'
However, he says manufacturers can help solve their integration problems
themselves in two ways.
The first goes back to the machine tool itself: manufacturers, if they have
the clout, can insist that all their machine tool suppliers install the same
controller.
Secondly, manufacturers have to accept that integrated systems can be too
heirarchical. 'Where you can have autonomy (in a flexible manufacturing
system, for example) you should let it happen. Some failed systems have
tried to make things too rigid.'
Indeed studies of the influence of FMS in the US since the mid-1980s have
shown that it is often a misnomer, since the system may be inflexible in its
design and the way in which it is used. Also several reports have claimed
that systems installed in the US lack the flexibility of those in Japan.
A recent report on the US FMS market by Frost &amp; Sullivan, the market
research publishers, says worldwide competition is forcing adoption of
flexible manufacturing in a variety of industries, but is becoming
increasingly important to batch-oriented manufacturers as product
life-cycles shorten and product changes become more frequent.
F &amp; S forecasts that sales of FMS equipment will rise from Dollars 266m in
1990 to Dollars 559m in 1995 (in constant 1990 dollars).
The biggest obstacle to installing equipment is price, and more companies
will be starting with the more limited flexible manufacturing cells (FMCs).
In the UK, British Aerospace has taken a novel approach to Cim by developing
its own manufacturing control system, Cimitar, which provides a
sophisticated computerised link between management information systems and
shop-floor controllers.
BAe began the Cimitar programme in 1983 after discovering that computer
companies could not satisfy its large-scale requirement for shop-floor
control systems. A separate company, BAeCAM, was set up in 1988 to develop
and market Cimitar worldwide, but Mr Brian Entwhistle, general manager, says
it was decided from the start to develop a generic product that could be
sold on the open market.
Cimitar, which uses DEC's Vax hardware, is in use throughout BAe but BAeCAM
recently signed up Caterpillar, the US construction equipment group, as a
user. Mr Entwhistle hopes this will provide a reference for further US
sales.
BAeCAM has also installed part of Cimitar on to an IBM PC that runs a
machine tool at BAe, elevating it from the normal download of data and
selection of tools and satisfying the need for complex communications
between the tools and the host computer.
As companies continue to grapple with the challenges of Cim, and consultants
to explain them, its ascendancy is being challenged by another acronym, Pim,
product information management, alternatively known as EDM, engineering data
management. Dr Charles Clarke of London-based Random Computing says that,
just as Cim was the catalyst for integrating manufacture, so Pim forces the
user to understand the existing process before being able to manage it or
use it.
The characteristics of Pim/EDM, which has also been described as a short cut
to Cim via Cadcam, include data management and control and data navigation
mechanisms, but the aim is enterprise-wide control of information.
This, says Dr Charles Clarke, liberates the user and allows true concurrent
engineering - designing a product and allowing its manufacture
simultaneously - for the first time.
'It links the islands of automation that yesterday's manufacturing industry
nurtured and constrains the 'paper flow' monster with its attendant
road-blocks and bottle-necks,' he says with an enthusiasm for metaphor
rarely found in studies of computers in manufacturing.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (1): Japanese still set
the pace - The importance of the human element in the production process
permeates Japanese methods. Now Western companies are beginning to
appreciate that there is a limit to what the computer can do to help the
manufacturers

MANUFACTURING methods have changed profoundly in the US and Europe over the
past few years. The adoption of total quality control and just-in-time
techniques have proven necessary to compete with Japanese manufacturers,
whose fundamentally different approach has set standards of efficiency and
quality Western manufacturers are still striving to emulate.
A comparative study of motor car manufacture in the US and Japan published
recently by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology makes the point
powerfully. General Motors' plant in Framingham in the US takes 31 hours to
assemble a car. There are 135 defects in every 100 cars and a two week
inventory of parts.
Toyota's Takaoka plant in Japan produces a car every 16 hours with on 45
faults per 100 cars. Its inventory is sufficient to sustain production for a
mere two hours.
The West's struggle to compete with Japan's growing manufacturing
superiority has been marked by false starts and expensive excursions up
technological blind alleys.
Western companies failed initially to understand the nature of the
difference in manufacturing philosophies, believing that low labour costs
and heavy use of technology were the answer.
In fact, with the appreciation of the yen, Japan's labour costs are not all
that different from its Western competitors. Japanese manufacturers
certainly use computers but sparingly, preferring to design their products
to suit them for manufacture, rather than the other way about.
They build quality into their products rather than inspect later for faults.
Responsibility for quality control is entrusted to the production worker
rather than the Western-style quality control department.
Increasingly, the trend is to parallelism or concurrent engineering, where
customer requirements, product design, manufacturing technology and cost
accountancy proceed in parallel and information is continuously fed back to
modify the manufacturing processes.
These ideas of design for manufacture and respect for the contribution
individuals can make to manufacturing quality permeate Japanese
manufacturing methods.
They are now diffusing to the West and are the essential backcloth against
which the growing use of computers in manufacturing must be seen.
Computer systems for manufacturers are supplied by computer makers rather
than traditional machine tool companies.
Hardware comes from companies such as IBM, ICL, Digital Equipment, Hewlett
Packard, and Bull Software is supplied by companies such as Istel
Automation, Kewill Systems and Prime Computers among a host of others. All
agree that with most Western economies exhibiting weakness, if not actual
recession, business is tough: 'but not as bad as it's made out to be'
according to Mr Peter Willis of IBM.
Mr Graham McKenzie, technical unit manager for Digital Equipment in the UK
says that buyers are focusing on the business benefits of installing
computer systems.
The industry is not helped by the continuing difficulty the accountancy
profession has found in cost justifying investment in modern computer
equipment.
A detailed study of the US valve industry by Dr Peter Weill called Do
Computers Pay Off?, (ICIT Press, 1990) concluded that the relationship
between computer investment and manufacturing was circular: 'It was not
possible to identify the unique contribution of any particular year of IT
investment. It is not clear that this can ever be achieved statistically'.
The advent of the microprocessor, by making available virtually unlimited
computer power at low cost, has given manufacturers a wide range of
powerful, computer-based technologies which can be deployed on the factory
floor as well as the back office.
There is computer aided design (Cad), pioneered by aerospace and computer
manufacturers, which provides not only an electronic drawing board, but also
product design information.
Computer aided engineering (CAE) automates the design process making it
possible to test the validity of a design before moving to the prototype
stage.
Computer aided manufacturing (Cam) involves a range of intelligent
shop-floor machinery including robots, numerically controlled machine tools,
flexible manufacturing centres and automated handling systems.
Much of this is taken for granted. Mr Brian Small, managing director of
Ingersoll Engineers, a UK manufacturing consultancy, says that manufacturing
computers today look like and are bought like conventional machine tools.
Convenience and simplicity of purchase does not guarantee success in
operation however and there are serious dangers in assuming that
manufacturing problems yield to an injection of technology.
The Strathclyde Institute, an independent manufacturing consultancy warns in
a recent report: 'Many people equate improved competitiveness in manufacture
with the application of state-of-the-art technology such as powerful
computer systems, MRP, Cad and robotics. While it may be advantageous or
necessary for a company to apply these and other enabling technologies in
pursuit of excellence, this should only be as part of an overall company
strategy.'*
'If such technologies are applied to a company without cognisance of the
needs or effects on other areas, at present or in the future, then it may be
difficult if not impossible to integrate the patchwork of systems across the
company.'
Integration is the important word in manufacturing automation. The goal for
forward looking companies is computer integrated manufacture (Cim), an
overused piece of jargon with many definitions.
One comprehensive definition from the Strathclyde Institute is: 'an amalgam
of computer aided engineering and drafting, computer aided manufacturing,
flexible manufacturing systems, tooling and quality support systems,
in-process gauging and automated final inspection, automated storage and
materials handling, and operations control within a business information
system.'
Mr Willis of IBM warns, however, that too often the 'i' in Cim stands for
interconnection rather than integration. There has to be, he explains, an
underlying Cim architecture: 'To complete a 1,000-piece jigsaw, you have to
have all the pieces and a picture on the box.' There is probably not a
single true Cim operation anywhere in the world.
Cell manufacture is emerging as one of the biggest steps towards integrated
manufacture. A survey by Ingersoll Engineers** suggests that over half of
the UK's engineering companies have implemented cell manufacture in some
part of their business.
Cells are self-contained manufacturing units with the machines, controls,
people and support needed to make a finished product complete with payment
schemes, incentives, performance measurements and accountability.
'Well over 90 per cent of manufacturers who have implemented cells have seen
an improvement in performance and 40 per cent describe the improvement as
significant. Fewer than 2 per cent have abandoned the approach,' says
Ingersoll.
Computer technology has a part to play in the flow of information necessary
to support and underpin these developments.
Successful manufacturers in the 1990s, however, will emphasise the human
dimension: 'What do you need to do the job?' will replace the order 'Look
after that machine]'

FT  14 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: Asda under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SUPERMARKET group Asda retreated in busy trading as the market continued to
worry about current trading. The shares finished 6 lower at 115p after 8.5m
had changed hands.
The decline was triggered by a weekend press report which identified Asda as
the food retailer most likely to suffer as competition in retailing
intensified. Talk that a broker had changed its investment advice to a hold
from a buy added to the pressure.
Suggestions that Goldman Sachs, which has been positive towards Asda in the
past, had changed its stance was denied. Mr Philip Dorgan of Goldman said
that with higher profits likely next year Asda was cheap at current levels.
BET disposal
The stability of BET shares in a generally weak equity market reflected
relief that the business services group's high level of debt had been
further reduced by the sale for Pounds 212m of Biffa, its waste disposal
business. The price disappointed some optimists who had been hoping for
nearer Pounds 250m, and BET shares slipped before rallying to close little
changed on balance at 178p.
The deal enables purchaser Severn Trent Water to achieve a key objective in
the specialist waste area. It also puts a question mark over Severn's near
30 per cent stake in Caird Group, another waste company. Severn withdrew a
100p cash per share offer last year and is free to bid again in October.
Chief executive Mr Roderick Paul said yesterday the board was 'reviewing the
options'.
Severn Trent fell to 272p but recovered on good buying to 277p for a net
loss of only 3. Analyst Mr Andrew Stone of Hoare Govett said the short-term
reaction was always likely to be down. 'But in the long term the acquisition
buys market share and gets Severn into an area where there is good potential
for development.' He advised clients to buy Severn stock.
SmithKline Beecham proved one of only three firm spots in the FT-SE 100
index. The shares, after recent weakness, ended up a penny at 790p awaiting
today's annual meeting. Rothmans International also bucked the trend, rising
2 to 875p on reports that it was considering buying the outstanding equity
of subsidiary Dunhill Holdings.
Reuters slipped 13 to 802p after bearish analysis from Nomura Research. The
latter maintained its sell stance on Reuters and shaved its profits
estimates for this year and next. Analyst Mr Martin Mabbutt said the stock
would be helped by a strengthening dollar but it still had not bottomed out.
BOC receded 13 to 545p on nervousness ahead of its half-year results due on
Thursday.
Allied-Lyons and Grand Metropolitan lost ground as buyers held off ahead of
trading reports scheduled for this week. Allied slipped 11 to 550p and
GrandMet lost 20 to 800p.
Oil shares failed to escape the general decline in spite of their generally
perceived strong defensive qualities. Specialists said there had been no
fundamental reasons to dump stock in the sector but pointed out that crude
oil prices had once more dipped below the Dollars 20 a barrel mark.
Shell ran back 12 to 511p but volume was a thin 1.8m ahead of Thursday's
first-quarter figures, expected to reveal net income of around Pounds 600m,
compared with Pounds 816m in the same period last year.
Ultramar, a penny harder at 314p, provided one of only three positive
performances in the FT-SE 100 stocks as the market braced itself for
tomorrow's first-quarter numbers. Worries remain that the oil group may post
a loss of up to Pounds 10m for the period, but general consensus is for the
company to manage a modest overall profit.
The threat of further litigation leading to even heavier losses on its
disastrous oil rig conversion contract upset Davy Corporation shares, which
dipped 8 to 120p.
Smith New Court advice to 'top-slice' holdings, meaning take profits, before
the annual results on May 22 brought Courtaulds back 8 to 390p.
More negative assessments from broking houses unsettled Trafalgar House and
the stock lost 4 more to 253p.
Hoare Govett maintains that 'back in November, the huge 15 per cent yield
and plausible recovery hopes added to an attractive story, but with the
shares since rising by over 75 per cent as performance has weakened,
Trafalgar is now well ahead of events.'
BT (formerly British Telecom) held up resolutely against a sharply weakening
market, closing only 3 off at 370p after County NatWest upgraded its profits
forecast and reiterated its buy recommendation. Mr Patrick Wellington at
County raised his profits and dividend estimates on the back of anticipated
lower tax charges.
Mr Wellington said BT offers 'very strong earnings and dividend growth,
excellent medium-term potential through cost reduction, fading political and
regulatory risk, and a strong technical position' ahead of the sale of the
government's remaining stock.
Hoare Govett took a much more cautious view of the stock, however,
recommending that clients move to 'underweight' in the shares.
Butler Cox jumped 99 to 230p after the agreed Pounds 14.3m bid from US group
Computer Sciences.
A number of bank shares were unsettled by stories concerning Brent Walker,
the troubled leisure group.
Standard Chartered bore the brunt of the selling pressure prompted by the
Brent Walker story, closing another 9 off at 370p; turnover was a low
238,000.
TSB was also affected and dipped 2 1/2 to 149p but Lloyds performed well,
holding at 350p. The heaviest turnover in the sector was in NatWest, which
eased 5 to 324p on 1.9m.
Cadbury-Schweppes declined 8 to 366p as speculation about a bond or equity
issue continued to depress the shares.
Dealings resumed yesterday in Sutcliffe Speakman, the activated carbon
company, which was rescued from the brink of receivership by a complex
refinancing plan involving the issue of 150m 10p shares. Sutcliffe shares
touched 12p before making steady upward progress to close at the day's
highest of 16 1/2 p, compared with last October's suspension price of 45p.
Profit-taking pulled Scottish Television back 20 to 697p. The company is
believed to be the only independent broadcaster able to make an uncontested
bid for its franchise when the bidding opens tomorrow. It has outperformed
the sector recently.
TVS Entertainment held firm in spite of poor results, losing only a penny to
64p.
Mr Terry Connor of Smith New Court said the stead-iness showed that 'the
market has chosen to concentrate on the franchises rather than results'.
WPP, the world's largest marketing services group, dropped 14 to 190p after
broker James Capel cut its profits forecast for the company by Pounds 13m to
50m.
Brent Walker, the leisure group, slipped sharply to close 16 down at 40p
following reports that it was expected to announce a Pounds 1bn write-down
of assets. The shares were also depressed by the announcement that 'although
the group produced profits at the operating level, it sustained a
substantial loss for the year . . . and its balance sheet at 31 December
1990 will show a major reduction in shareholders' funds'.
A significant shift in the balance of forecasts of corporate profits by City
analysts during April should not be over-emphasised, warns Barclays de Zoete
Wedd. Analysts have tended to underestimate the depth of the UK recession
and more downgrades may come in the summer.

FT  14 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Weak yen and slide in
New York push Nikkei lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE prices declined in low volume yesterday, as sentiment was depressed by
Friday's drop on Wall Street and the yen's weakness against the dollar,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average ended 181.09 lower at 26,093.20 after a day's high of
26,338.49 and a low of 26,092.22. Volume shrank to 230m shares from Friday's
340m. Activity has remained under 400m shares for 15 consecutive sessions,
while the Nikkei has traded around 26,000 for 35 trading days in a row.
Falls outnumbered rises by 658 to 279, with 177 issues unchanged. The Topix
index of all first section stocks shed 13.37 to 1,977.78, but in London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 2.62 to 1,474.57.
Rumours that the Ministry of Finance had warned a leading Japanese brokerage
concern that it was trading too heavily in the over-the-counter market
depressed sentiment on the smaller sections. The second section index lost
23.32 to 3,400.13 and the OTC index fell 106.12 to 3,126.13.
Traders said institutions were likely to remain on the sidelines as long as
the Nikkei stayed around 26,000, and ahead of some company results to be
announced in the next few weeks.
The electrical sector weakened on reports that Pioneer Electronic had
revised its earnings projections downward and now expected a 21 per cent
profits fall. Pioneer dropped Y630 to Y4,370, Sony Y180 to Y6,080 and TDK
Y140 to Y5,520.
The real estate sector fell 0.8 per cent on news of weak condominium sales
announced over the weekend. Mitsubishi Estate shed Y20 to Y1,500.
Contractors were also weak, Taisei slipping Y24 to Y975 and Haseko Y14 to
Y906.
Daifuku, an industrial machinery maker, rose initially on recommendations by
Japanese brokerages based on strong sales of the company's automated
warehouses and storage systems. The issue touched a 1991 high, but later
receded on profit-taking to end a net Y10 off at Y2,850.
Investment trusts sold drug issues. Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical, which expects
its pre-tax profits to rise only 2 per cent, retreated Y60 to Y2,730.
Tosoh, a chemical group, rose Y27 to Y646. The company expects pre-tax
profits to rise 57 per cent to Y11bn thanks to strong earnings at
Shin-Daikyowa Petrochemical, which Tosoh acquired last October.
In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 167.54 to 29,062.87 on volume of 23.2m
shares. Osaka Sanso Kogyo, an industrial gas maker, declined Y10 to Y665 on
weak earnings for the current year due to rising labour and distribution
costs.
Yamato International, a fashion wear wholesaler, rose Y20 to Y1,200. Strong
earnings are expected this year.
Roundup
ALTHOUGH Hong Kong rose on domestic considerations, most markets in the
region fell in sympathy with the Wall Street slide last Friday.
AUSTRALIA in addition showed nervousness ahead of tomorrow's inflation
report for the March quarter, and results from Westpac and National
Australia Bank due on Thursday. The All Ordinaries index weakened 25.2 to
1,523.1 but turnover expanded from ADollars 231m to ADollars 270m.
BHP, Australia's biggest company, went ex a 21-cent dividend and fell a net
29 cents to ADollars 12.15 in heavy volume. CRA closed 25 cents lower at
ADollars 12.90 after lifting its takeover offer for Coal and Allied
Industries from ADollars 7.85 to ADollars 8.50 a share. The latter put on 4
cents to ADollars 8.60.
NEW ZEALAND broke its winning streak as the Barclays index relinquished
35.53 or 2.3 per cent to 1,538.21 as turnover climbed from NZDollars 19.1m
to NZDollars 27.7m. Fletcher Challenge fell 24 cents to NZDollars 3.90 on
1.5m shares traded, in line with the issue price for 50m shares placed over
the weekend with international institutions. A further 25m new shares might
be issued, to raise a total of NZDollars 292.5m.
BNZ went against the trend, firming a cent to 76 cents after Mr Jim Bolger,
New Zealand's prime minister, rejected repeated speculation that the
government is planning to sell its 58.2 per cent stake in the bank. Fay,
Richwhite, which owns 26.2 per cent of BNZ, closed steady at 72 cents.
SINGAPORE lost almost 1 per cent, the Straits Times Industrial index closing
14.93 off at 1,517.39 in thin trade.
TAIWAN's weighted index fell 106.39 or 1.7 per cent to 6,102.09 on news that
Fuh Hwa Securities Finance was tightening its margin lending to stock market
players. Traders said some 30 per cent of daily turnover came from Fuh Hwa's
margin lending.
BANGKOK complained of lack of drive, and money being drawn out of the market
to subscribe for planned new issues. The SET index finished 17.72 or 2.1 per
cent lower at 828.16 after thin turnover worth 2.85bn baht.
The four new highly priced issues which made their debut last Friday were
heavily sold for a second day. Siam Chemicals fell 14 baht to 134 baht and
Eastern Wire, a construction wire producer, declined 11 to 106 baht.
HONG KONG rose on weekend news that Sino-British talks on the large-scale
local airport project will resume this weekend. The Hang Seng index put on
17.43 to 3,767.63, although turnover fell from HKDollars 1.31bn to HKDollars
1.06bn.

FT  14 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Italy welcomes
larger-than-expected interest rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY WAS encouraged yesterday by the weekend's interest rate cut, but Wall
Street's sharp fall on Friday subdued most bourses from the outset, writes
Our Markets Staff.
MILAN was lifted by Sunday's full percentage point cut in the Bank of
Italy's official discount rate to 11.5 per cent. The market had expected a
reduction of only half a point, so the larger-than-expected cut was viewed
as boding well for the June trading account, which starts on Thursday.
The Comit index rose 4.08 to 581.24 in volume estimated at L150bn after
Friday's thin L115bn, bloated yesterday by activity related to the expiry of
monthly options.
Italcementi jumped L670 or 3.2 per cent to L21,500 on better-than-expected
1990 consolidated net profits of L206bn, up from L170.3bn, although analysts
suspected that the rise was helped by extraordinary items. The share was
also boosted by news of a L60bn share buy-back programme over the next 18
months which came as a surprise.
FRANKFURT was depressed by rumours that Mr Karl Otto Pohl, Bundesbank
president, would resign, by the drop in popularity of the ruling CDU, and by
a leaked McKinsey report which was said to be negative on German economic
prospects.
Volume slid again, from DM3.4bn to DM3bn, as the FAZ index lost 5.09 to
680.67 and the DAX closed 9.73 lower at 1,610.90. It was a day for dealers
rather than investors, said Mr James Cornish at County NatWest, who added
that Frankfurt was recognising that its outperformance in April had not made
sense, in terms of share price valuation or economic prospects.
There were individual windows to east German recovery prospects, he noted.
Siemens Nixdorf, up DM13 last Friday, rose another DM7 to DM259, turnover in
the stock growing from DM18m to DM49m as attention focused on April orders
for data processing equipment. West German civil servants are being paid
'head money' to go east, and equipment is being bought for their new east
German locations.
Elsewhere, turnover in Continental fell from DM50m to DM25m as the shares
lost DM6 to DM197 on profit-taking.
PARIS drifted lower in quiet trading worth about FFr1.6bn, with the CAC 40
index falling 15.82 or 0.9 per cent to 1,834.45. Among weaker blue chips,
Alcatel Alsthom fell FFr12 to FFr588 on 229,510 shares.
Schneider, the electrical equipment group, closed FFr10 higher at FFr762,
after reaching FFr767 earlier, on volume of 110,375 shares. Investors were
relieved at the removal of uncertainty, following the acceptance of
Schneider's bid for Square D of the US.
Among the big movers, Canal Plus, the television company, gained FFr35 or
3.4 per cent to FFr1,070 on 31,450 shares. Its rival, TF1, was suspended
briefly owing to an order imbalance, before closing FFr10.50 down at
FFr285.50.
Suez eased FFr2.20 to FFr349. The news that the financial holding company
could open up the capital of Banque Indosuez was fairly well received, said
one analyst, amid speculation that Suez could be considering an acquisition
to improve its European merchant banking network.
MADRID's general index edged higher before today's inflation news, rising
0.51 to 285.22. Turnover was moderate, but fell to about Pta15bn from
Friday's heavy Pta28.9bn.
Focsa, which is due to merge with another construction company, dropped
Pta260 to Pta14,140.
AMSTERDAM fell at the opening, and failed to recover for the rest of the
session. The CBS tendency index closed down 0.5 at 94.4 in quiet trading
worth Fl 480.8m.
Royal Dutch led the losers, shedding Fl 3 to Fl 160.70 after setting an
all-time high of Fl 165.10 on Friday. The oil company reports its
first-quarter results on Thursday.
Unilever, which reports its quarterly results on Friday, fell 80 cents to Fl
158.40.
OSLO recouped an early loss to close at its third consecutive year's high.
The all-share index gained 2.76 to 521.46.
STOCKHOLM was depressed by weak overseas markets and profit-taking in Astra,
the pharmaceutical company. The Affarsvarlden General index lost 6.4 to
1,037.5 in turnover of SKr315m, down from SKr325m.
Astra free B shares fell SKr9 to SKr575 before the company's first-quarter
profits announcement, which came after the bourse closed and were better
than expected.
ZURICH fell in low volume, the Credit Suisse index slipping 3.8 to 541.7.
Slightly lower interest rates gave some support. In a relatively firm
engineering sector, Schindler registered shares rose SFr60 to SFr1,095
before today's annual news conference.
BRUSSELS, after its holidays last Thursday and Friday, was dominated by
Petrofina, the oil company, which rose BFr200 or 1.7 per cent to BFr11,800
with 25,420 shares changing hands, or nearly 30 per cent of the BFr939m
market turnover.
The Bel 20 index closed 4.68 higher at 1,179.39. After hours, Groupe
Bruxelles Lambert repeated that it would probably increase its 21 per cent
Petrofina stake.

FT  14 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets: Oslo joins small band of outperformers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACQUELINE MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DECLINE in the US, which was at the mercy of the bond market during the
quarterly refunding, left the world's stock markets 0.6 per cent lower in
local currency terms last week, according to the FT-Actuaries World Indices.
Most markets, however, were little changed. The main exceptions were the now
familiar outperformers of Mexico and New Zealand, joined last week by
Norway.
The Norwegian market, which has lagged behind most European bourses this
year, jumped 8.5 per cent in local currency terms. Daily turnover grew from
a level of NKr302m at the start of the week to NKr820m on Friday.
Mr Per Jacobsen of Baring Securities says the triggers for this renewed
interest included rising optimism about the economy and company results,
falling interest rates, the market's relative cheapness, and decreasing
pessimism over the tax reforms.
Good first-quarter figures in early May, particularly from Saga Petroleum
and Hafslund Nycomed, the pharmaceutical group, have banished investors'
earlier doubts. Baring now expects weighted earnings growth of 11 per cent
this year, after a fall of 28 per cent in 1990.
The proposed tax reforms have also become less of a concern. 'People have
had time to consider the reforms and are less alarmed by them, and there are
indications that they are being watered down,' says Mr Jacobsen.
He even believes the proposed tax changes could have some positive effects.
From 1992, capital gains on shares held for more than three years will no
longer be tax free. However, the cost price of these shares will be set by
taking the average share price between November 1 and December 31 this year,
which means that shareholders will want to see high prices during that
period, and so reduce their capital gains and the tax payable. 'If the rules
come through in their present form, a year-end rally seems likely,' he
predicts.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Money Markets: London rates steady
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RATES WERE little changed on the London money market yesterday, with
three-month sterling interbank continuing to discount a cut of  1/2 point in
bank base rates, despite last Friday's strong warning from the Bank of
England against an early move.
The authorities reinforced this view yesterday by not supplying enough
assistance to take out the full underlying shortage on the money market,
leaving overnight funds tight at around 12 1/2 per cent.
Three-month interbank was quoted at 11 9/16 -11 1/2 per cent, compared with
11 9/16 -11 7/16 previously, and 12-month money was unchanged at 11 1/8 -11
per cent.
Short sterling futures traded in a narrow range of 88.81 to 88.87 for June
delivery on Liffe. The contract opened lower at 88.85 and closed at the
day's low of 88.81, compared with 88.88 on Friday.
Day-to-day credit was in more comfortable supply than of late on the cash
market. The Bank of England initially forecast a shortage of Pounds 500m,
but revised this to Pounds 450m at noon, and to Pounds 400m in the
afternoon. Total help of Pounds 201m was provided.
The authorities did not operate in the market before lunch, but in the
afternoon bought Pounds 121m bills outright, by way of Pounds 1m Treasury
bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent and Pounds 120m bank bills in band 1 at
11 7/8 per cent. Late assistance of around Pounds 80m was also provided.
Bills maturing in official hands, repayment of late assistance and a take-up
of Treasury bills drained Pounds 849m, with the unwinding of repurchase
agreements on bills absorbing Pounds 322m, and bank balances below target
Pounds 5m. These outweighed exchequer transactions adding Pounds 50m to
liquidity and a fall in the note circulation of Pounds 650m.
In Madrid the Bank of Spain left its money market rate unchanged at 13.5 per
cent at yesterday's thrice-monthly repurchase tender for central bank
certificates. This is the main instrument of Spanish credit policy and was
last changed on March 15.
In Brussels the Belgian National Bank left its seven day advances rate, the
main instrument of monetary policy, unchanged at 8.75 per cent at a tender
for credits against government paper and commercial bills.
In Frankfurt call money rose to 8.85 from 8.80 per cent as payments for a
government bond drained about DM7bn from the money market.

TWO BRAZILIAN mineral groups have just clinched a deal to mine an estimated
720,000 tonnes of zinc and 180,000 tonnes of lead in a mine near Lima, Peru.
Companhia Paraibuna Met-ais, the second largest zinc producer in Brazil, has
entered in-to a joint venture with Brazilian-based Construtora Norberto
Odebrecht, Peruvian-based Mineracao Barra Ventura, and Minero Peru, the
state-owned mineral group of Peru.
The groups will have shares in the project of 45 per cent, 15 per cent, 15
per cent, and 25 per cent respectively.
Mr Ronaldo Salerno, president of Paraibuna, said the company signed the deal
to guarantee a zinc supply for its Brazilian refineries. 'Control over the
mine will also guarantee quality,' added Mr Salerno. Brazil has few known
zinc reserves.
Salerno also announced that the group was exploring reserves in Bolivia,
with an eye to opening up zinc mines in that country.
The Peruvian joint venture will require a Dollars 50m investment over the
next four years. By 1996, Mr Salerno expects the mine to be in full
production.
Mr Salerno cautioned that, although the joint venture has been agreed, the
group will not put any money into the project until it has confirmed Peru's
estimates of zinc deposits in the area.

issues rush
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE INTERNATIONAL bond market was awash with new issues yesterday as
borrowers launched deals delayed last week by public holidays in Europe and
the Treasury refunding operations in the US.
Against the background of Citicorp's global asset-backed deal, the sterling
sector of the mortgage-backed market was tested by a Pounds 200m
twin-tranche issue from Mortgage Funding Corporation No. 4, a
special-purpose vehicle of Eagle Star.
Lead-managed by Credit Suisse First Boston, the deal offers paper with an
average life of 1.5 and five years.
Every deal in the sector this year has pushed back the limits of terms which
are acceptable to investors.
For example, the longer-dated tranche of yesterday's issue pays a discounted
margin of 62.5 basis points over the three-month London interbank offered
rate.
This is identical to the discounted margin offered on the tranche of the
recent issue by CMS No 9, which had an average life of 3.6 years.
Recent deals have abandoned the earlier practice of offering investors a
step-up in margin from next year if banks are forced by the regulators to
put aside more capital against holdings of mortgage-backed paper. As
sentiment has improved, non-bank investors have started to buy
mortgage-backed bonds again, making the market less vulnerable to the
proposed regulatory change.
The UK government bond market was weak throughout the day, but this did not
prevent Tokyo Electric Power from becoming the latest Japanese borrower to
issue sterling-denominated bonds.
The borrower issued Pounds 150m of 10-year bonds priced to yield 52 basis
points over the 10 per cent gilt maturing 2001. The yield spread is wider
than on other recent deals by Japanese names. For example, Nippon Telegraph
and Telephone launched its Pounds 100m deal at a spread of 50 basis points
over gilts and has now tightened to 45 basis points. However, Tokyo Electric
Power is less well known in the international bond market.
Despite negative sentiment in the market, lead manager Credit Suisse First
Boston opted to press ahead with the deal. Having been reoffered to
investors at a fixed price of 99.70, the bonds traded down to 99.40 as gilts
weakened. However, the yield spread remained at around 52 basis points.
Credit Lyonnais became the first bank to issue longer-dated Eurodollar bonds
for some months, launching a Dollars 300m seven-year deal. The deal,
increased from Dollars 250m, offers paper priced at a yield spread of 74
basis points over US government bonds.
Participants said the yield spread was generous enough to tempt investors
looking to lengthen the duration of their portfolio exposure to the US
currency.
The lead manager, Credit Lyonnais, reported strong buying from continental
European investors. The paper traded at around the fixed re-offer price of
99.40.
The Republic of Ireland yesterday raised Pta10bn with an issue of seven-year
bonds in the Spanish market. The deal maintained international interest in
peseta-denominated bonds, which was given further impetus by the cut in
Italian interest rates over the weekend.

The financing, which complements a Dollars 2.5bn bankers' acceptance

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE securities companies, under pressure to allow banks into their
industry, have reaffirmed their opposition to banks entering stockbroking,
the most lucrative part of their business.
However, they are prepared to see banks compete in the underwriting market,
according to a draft report to the Ministry of Finance made public over the
weekend.
The concessions are unlikely to satisfy banks or end a prolonged debate over
the reform of Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Law - Japan's
version of the Glass-Steagall Act in the US.
The draft report, prepared by a study panel of the Securities and Exchange
Council, an advisory body to the ministry, recommends allowing banks to
lead-manage publicly-placed bonds through subsidiaries, and to issue
privately-placed bonds.
However, it says banks should, 'for the time being,' be banned from broking,
the backbone of the securities companies' profits. The Securities and
Exchange Council, organised by the Finance Ministry's securities bureau,
represents the views of the securities industry.
A parallel report, representing the views of banks, is expected to be
published soon. It will probably call for banks to be granted more
comprehensive access to the securities market, including early entry into
broking.
The reports are part of a review of the barriers separating banks and
securities companies under Article 65. The ministry wants to implement
reforms by 1993. Officials are having to balance the demands of banks for
change with calls from the securities industry, particularly small and
medium-sized companies, for preserving the status quo.
A ministry official said the final reports of the securities and the banking
industries are expected to be presented to the ministry at the end of May,
or some time in June.

FT  14 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Shielding investors from
predators - The role of contingent value rights in a bull market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Any revival of mergers and acquisitions activity in the US could renew
interest in a family of financial instruments headed by CVRs - contingent
value rights - which offer investors protection against a poorly performing
stock price.
While just a handful of contingent financial instruments were issued in the
bull market of the late 1980s, interest could be stronger this time around
the economic cycle.
The company issuing the CVR targets a future share price and promises to pay
the holder the difference between the target price and the actual share
price at the exercise date, subject to an upper limit.
Hence the company may face a substantial liability if its shares do not
reach the target price.
Alternatively, if the shares perform well, the CVRs expire worthless.
In the US, CVRs were originally issued following the mergers which formed
the pharmaceutical groups Rhone-Poulenc Rorer and Marion Merrell Dow in
1989.
For example, Dow Chemical will pay the holders of its CVRs the difference
between Dollars 45.77 and the price of Marion Merrell Dow shares in
September this year - up to a maximum payment of Dollars 15.77 or Dollars
1.5bn in total.
Last week Marion Merrell Dow shares were trading at Dollars 34 per share,
implying a Dollars 11-per-CVR, or Dollars 1bn, liability.
However, Dow Chemical has the option of extending the deadline by one year,
in which case the target share price rises to Dollars 50.23 and the maximum
payment Dollars 20.23.
The acquiring companies view the CVR liability as something akin to a
deferred consideration, which is revealed in a note to the annual report and
accounts.
'From the predators' perspective, these are instruments which offer a kind
of earn-out to stockholders in the company which is being taken over,' said
Mr Ben Krause, head of the capital markets group at the American Stock
Exchange in New York, on which both the Dow and Rhone-Poulenc CVRs are
listed.
This type of profits participation role was even more obvious in an earlier
issue of contingent payment rights for Eli Lilly. These instruments gave
holders the right to profits participation following the Dollars 350m
acquisition of Hybritech in 1986.
In part, CVR issues were driven by an accounting loophole, which allowed the
dominant partners in the merger - Rhone-Poulenc and Dow Chemical - to keep
goodwill resulting from the transaction off the merged entities' balance
sheet. This is particularly important in the pharmaceutical industry, where
valuations of companies are well in excess of asset value, reflecting the
future value of drugs still in the research and development phase.
The amortisation of goodwill arising from mergers would severely depress the
profits of the merged entity.
The US accounting loophole has now been closed, but CVRs have not
disappeared from the corporate finance scene.
Contingent participation rights - whether based on profits performance or
share price performance - could be used as a defence against takeover by
guaranteeing holders a minimum return on investment.
NCR, the US computer manufacturer, reportedly considered issuing CVRs as a
defence against AT&amp;T's hostile bid. Consolidated Goldfields also considered
making a CVR issue as a defence against Minorco.
There certainly seems to be an appetite among international investors for
instruments which offer some form of protection against a poorly performing
share price.
For example, Roche, the Swiss pharmaceuticals group, decided to issue
unusual 'bull spread' warrants rather than ordinary equity warrants in a
Dollars 1bn issue in April.
Just like CVRs, the 'bull spread' warrant structure offers protection
against a collapse in the share price over the next three years - but at the
cost of limiting annual returns.
The warrants were issued when Roche shares were trading at around SFr7,500.
On the exercise date in May 1994, holders of the warrants can either take
one Roche share, a cash payment of SFr7,000, or, at the companies
discretion, a cash payment of SFr10,000.
There certainly seems to be a future for contingent financial instruments in
one form or other. However, the permutations are many and the risks to the
issuing company could be significant. Corporate financiers make two points:
The promise to compensate for poor share price growth, and therefore
presumably for poor earnings growth, is only credible if the issuer is a
strong company. Roche, Dow Chemical, Rhone-Poulenc and Eli Lilley are all
solid blue-chip stocks. However, the roster of potential issuers is limited
to larger corporations able to weather a downturn in performance.
Only a brave company would target its share price in the current uncertain
economic climate. The experience of convertible bonds incorporating a put
option - which allows the holder to cash in the bonds early - may have been
chastening.

SA BREWING Holdings, the diversified Adelaide-based brewing and
manufacturing group, yesterday said it had more than doubled its share of
the US water heater market through the USDollars 31.65m acquisition of
Mor-Flo Industries.
SA Brewing said the acquisition would give it 30 per cent of the US market
for mains pressure water heaters, which accounts for around 7.6m units a
year.
The group entered the US water heaters market in 1989 thorough the purchase
of Bradford-White Corporation of Michigan, which claimed around 12 per cent
of the market.
Mr Ross Wilson, SA Brewing managing director, said the acquisition of
Mor-Flo, which has annual sales of around USDollars 200m, was in line with
the group's long-term strategy of increasing its US presence. Mr Wilson said
SA Brewing would rationalise the manufacturing operations of Mor-Flo and
Bradford-White.
The deal, which is subject to US regulatory approval, is expected to be
concluded in August.

Excluding the special item, consolidated profit dipped 3 cents a share, due

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEMOTEC Data of Montreal says a proxy fight to remove three of its directors
is a thinly-disguised effort by telecommunications conglomerate BCE to gain
control over Canada's overseas telephone monopoly.
Mr William McKenzie, Memotec's chief executive, took full-page
advertisements in Canadian newspapers yesterday, accusing BCE of seeking to
undermine the 'independent direction' of its wholly-owned telephone
subsidiary, Teleglobe Canada.
'This is not an issue about Memotec management,' Mr McKenzie said. 'The
issue is control of Teleglobe.'
Memotec announced yesterday that it earned CDollars 1.1m (USDollars
950,000m) in the first quarter, compared with a CDollars 4.1m loss a year
earlier. Revenues rose by 9 per cent to CDollars 99.9m. The company ascribed
the improvement mainly to better operating results from its
telecommunications businesses and the restructuring of computer
subsidiaries.
BCE controls Bell Canada, the country's biggest domestic telephone company,
and is also the controlling shareholder of telephone equipment maker
Northern Telecom.
BCE has a 31 per cent stake in Memotec, and has expressed its displeasure in
the past over the company's management.
However, the proxy fight was launched last week by Gordon Capital, a Toronto
securities firm. BCE will have to abstain in the proxy vote, which is due to
be taken at the annual meeting in Montreal this Thursday. BCE has an
agreement with Memotec to vote only for its own nominees to the Memotec
board.
Gordon said last week that it owns no shares in Memotec. If its proxy fight
is successful, however, its three nominees plus four directors representing
BCE could outvote the rest of the board.
Memotec's other large shareholders have not yet said how they will vote.
They include the Caisse de Depot, the Quebec public-sector pension plan, and
the Ontario municipal employees' pension fund.
In its proxy solicitation, Gordon criticised Memotec for expanding into
high-technology businesses by using cash mainly from Teleglobe.
Mr McKenzie called Gordon's move an 'ambush' which gives inadequate time for
shareholders or management to consider their positions. Memotec has hinted
it might seek to postpone Thursday's meeting as part of its defensive
tactics.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MGM-PATHE, the embattled Hollywood studio acquired by Mr Giancarlo
Parretti's Pathe Communications for Dollars 1.3bn last year, has won a brief
respite in its fight for survival.
The company has reached an out-of-court settlement with a group of creditors
who had filed a suit to force the studio into involuntary Chapter 7
liquidation.
The studio has agreed to pay Dollars 15m of claims in full, and the
creditors will join in a motion to dismiss the case. A hearing has been
scheduled in a federal bankruptcy court for Thursday.
The settlement with creditors was crucial to MGM-Pathe's survival. Credit
Lyonnais, the French bank, had made a Dollars 145m loan contingent on the
suit's dismissal.
Credit Lyonnais, an important backer in several of Mr Parretti's
acquisitions, has already provided at least Dollars 250m in loans to
MGM-Pathe.
The promised Dollars 145m loan should be sufficient to allow MGM-Pathe to
release several films which have been delayed because of the studio's severe
cash-flow problems.
MGM-Pathe's future, however, is far from certain. About Dollars 70m of the
Dollars 145m loan is already spoken for in undisputed claims which the
company said it would pay as soon as the creditor petition is dismissed. And
the company, which has sold its valuable film library, is in desperate need
of a large hit film.
Credit Lyonnais, which has been facing growing criticism at home over its
dealings with Mr Parretti, has become more aggressively active in the
studio's management. Pressure from the bank is believed to be behind the
ousting of Mr Parretti from the helm of Pathe Communications last month.
In addition, MGM-Pathe must reduce its obligations to Credit Lyonnais to
Dollars 125m by the end of November or the bank will gain voting control of
Pathe and will be allowed to sell 51 per cent of MGM-Pathe or Pathe
Communications.
As part of its plan to repay Credit Lyonnais, a 40 per cent stake in
MGM-Pathe has been essentially put on the block.

FT  14 MAY 91 / International Company News: Canada oil group to be
privatised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CANADIAN government expects to proceed in mid-June with the first phase
of privatising Petro-Canada, the country's biggest domestically-owned oil
company.
The PetroCan privatisation is the biggest so far in the programme started
seven years ago by the government of Mr Brian Mulroney.
Based on a preliminary prospectus filed late last week, analysts predict
that the public offering of a 15 per cent stake in PetroCan will raise close
to CDollars 500m (USDollars 434m).
Foreigners can subscribe for up to 25 per cent of the issue, but no
shareholder will be permitted to own more than a 10 per cent stake.
Investors will be required to buy at least 50 shares. Small investors who
apply before June 14 for between 50 and 250 shares will be given priority.
RBC Dominion Securities is the lead underwriter.
Analysts expect that, if only for political reasons, the issue will be
priced attractively, about CDollars 15 a share, well below the company's net
asset value.
The preliminary prospectus was accompanied by an announcement that PetroCan
suffered a CDollars 52m first-quarter loss, compared with profits of
CDollars 40m a year earlier. The loss was blamed mainly on low refining
margins and a CDollars 14m restructuring charge.
PetroCan was created in 1975 to give Ottawa a window on the energy industry.
Much of its growth came from the acquisition of Canadian assets from foreign
oil companies, including Atlantic Richfield, Petrofina and BP. Assets were
CDollars 7.3bn at the end of last year.

FT  14 MAY 91 / International Company News: Bankers Trust sheds 200 jobs in
restructuring move

THE slump in corporate finance activity in the US claimed more victims
yesterday when Bankers Trust, the New York banking group, announced the
restructuring of its corporate finance department at the cost of 200 jobs.
The job losses are a result of Bankers Trust's decision to merge the three
units which covered worldwide lending and financing activities into a single
Global Corporate Finance department which will provide commercial and
investment banking services to the group's US and international clients.
Although the redundancies will be spread throughout the group's offices
across the world, the bulk will come from Bankers Trust's New York
headquarters.
The costs of compensating the 200 dismissed staff has already been accounted
for by the severance pay expense reported in the first quarter.
So far this year, the group has shed 600 of its 13,000 staff, and more
redundancies are expected as part of a general cost-cutting programme.
The lay-offs at Bankers Trust are a result of the worldwide downturn in
corporate finance business, primarily caused by the slowdown in economic
growth worldwide and the credit crunch in the US and Japan.
Lower interest rates in the US have so far failed to spur any significant
increases in bank lending to companies. Moreover, big mergers and
acquisitions are still a rarity, and junk-bond financing remains in the
doldrums. The result has been a sharp drop in income from corporate finance
activity, an area of traditional strength for Bankers Trust.
Although it has avoided some of the other problems afflicting US banks (it
is considerably less burdened by bad real estate loans), Bankers Trust has
not been immune to the corporate finance slump.
Fees earned by the group from corporate finance business fell 23 per cent in
the first quarter of this year, and in the whole of 1990 corporate finance
fees were down by 27 per cent.
As part of the restructuring, Bankers Trust has set up several new units,
including those to cover the real estate and energy business.
An integrated European merchant banking unit based in London that will
tackle eastern European corporate finance has also been established.
Mr Ralph McDonald, formerly head of corporate finance for North American and
Europe, and Mr George Vojta, who was in charge of financing in emerging
markets in less-developed countries, will be joint heads of the new global
finance department, which will also handle lease and project finance and
asset-backed lending.

FT  14 MAY 91 / International Company News: Hugo Boss holds payout as
profits fall sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Financial Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUGO BOSS, the German men's fashion group controlled from Japan, yesterday
reported a steep decline in profits for 1990 but said it would maintain the
dividend.
On sales slightly higher at DM922m (Dollars 534m) against DM884m, the
company suffered a fall in net profits to DM28m last year from DM35.9m in
1989. Operating profits were DM67.7m, against DM90.9m. Earnings per share
fell from DM62 to DM51. The company is holding its dividend at DM20 per
share and DM21.50 per preference share.
Hugo Boss said its earnings potential remained strong this year, but it was
too early in the year to make a profit forecast because of the uncertain
outlook for the German economy and the dollar.
Mr Gunther Strothe, management board member for finance, said Hugo Boss's
profit had fallen, largely due to DM30m in extraordinary depreciation on US
activities.
'Disregarding the effect from the extraordinary depreciation on the parent
company, its operating profit would have been DM88.9m - just under 14 per
cent of sales - or DM7.8m more than the previous year,' Mr Strothe said.
In the first four months of this year, parent company sales had risen by
more than 10 per cent, he said, adding the company did not expect to take
any extraordinary depreciations this year.
Majority control of Hugo Boss was sold in December 1989 to Leyton House, a
privately-owned Japanese group specialising in sports and leisure wear.
Leyton is controlled by Mr Akira Akagi.
Hugo Boss floated 20 per cent of its equity capital on the German market in
March 1989. The shares were sold by the company's two founding brothers, Uwe
and Holy Boss.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ASTRA, the Swedish pharma-ceutical company, yesterday exceeded market
expectations by posting a 45 per cent jump in pre-tax profits to SKr757m
(Dollars 122.4m) for the first quarter of 1991 as sales of its stomach ulcer
drug Losec doubled.
Analysts had predicted a 35 per cent growth in earnings for Astra, which was
the best performer on the Stockholm bourse last year. The company, headed by
Mr Hakan Mogren, had revised upward its forecast for the year, saying
profits would climb by 30 per cent to SKr3.3bn. Its previous forecast had
estimated growth at 25 per cent.
Operating profits increased by 22 per cent to SKr598m. Improved net interest
income from Astra's large cash reserves, which totalled SKr5bn at the end of
March, and favourable exchange rates for income from its foreign
subsidiaries contributed to the buoyant pre-tax earnings.
Sales during the period increased by 27 per cent to SKr2.74bn, with turnover
from Losec, Astra's largest-selling product, increasing to SKr577m from
SKr284m a year ago.
Marketing of Losec by licensees, primarily Merck in the US, raised the
drug's total sales to SKr880m from SKr360m.
Losec suffered a setback in the US in January when the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) refused to approve the drug for first-line treatment of
all ulcers. Astra said yesterday that it is holding talks with the FDA on
widening its approval of Losec usage and it predicted that the FDA will make
a decision in the near future.
Losec was also introduced last month in Japan, potentially the biggest
national market for the drug after the US.
Drugs for the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases, dominated by Losec,
had total sales of SKr626m, a 88 per cent increase. Drugs for respiratory
diseases, however, remain Astra's largest product group, with sales climbing
to SKr643m, a 26 per cent rise.
The Turbohaler, an inhaler which delivers medication for asthma patients,
has boosted sales for two asthma drugs. Sales of the new asthma agent
Pulmicort increased by 57 per cent to SKr264m, while sales for the older
bronchial drug Bricanyl rose by 19 per cent to SKr182m.

FT  14 MAY 91 / International Company News: CRA increases offer for Cail to
ADollars 8.50 a share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CRA, the Australian mining group, yesterday attempted a knockout blow in its
hostile takeover bid for Coal and Allied Industries (Cail) by raising its
offer from ADollars 7.85 to ADollars 8.50 a share, valuing the company at
ADollars 472m (USDollars 370m).
CRA, a 49 per cent subsidiary of RTZ of the UK, holds around 13 per cent of
Cail. The acquisition would probably allow it to overtake the Broken Hill
Proprietary Company as Australia's biggest coal exporter by the middle of
the decade.
The group also declared its bid unconditional, and said it was confident of
receiving acceptances for more than 50 per cent of Cail shares before the
offer closes on Monday.
However, Mr Neil Currie, Cail chairman, told shareholders in a letter that
they should continue to reject the offer, which is pitched 10 cents below
last night's closing price of ADollars 8.60 on the Australian Stock
Exchange.
The revised offer is also substantially lower than a valuation of between
ADollars 10.70 and ADollars 11.20 put on Cail last week by Grant Samuel and
Associates in a report commissioned by Cail.
The report said the CRA offer failed to reflect the strategic value of the
low-cost mines operated by Cail, Australia's second largest coal producer.
CRA said the revised offer represented a premium of 33 per cent on the
average market price for Cail during the current year, and warned it would
not be increased.
Analysts said it was unclear whether the offer would tempt sufficient
shareholders to give CRA victory. However, National Mutual and BT Funds
Management, which each hold around 7 per cent of Cail, said they would
consider the offer.
CRA has been cautious in its pursuit of Cail because of losses on its
ADollars 300m purchase of most of British Petroleum's Australian coal assets
in 1989, for which analysts say it paid too much.
In a separate development yesterday, CRA said Novacoal, a 60 per cent
subsidiary, had sacked 278 employees following a walkout at its Howick coal
mine in the Hunter Valley, the premier coal-producing region of New South
Wales.
The walkout followed the sacking of three employees for refusing to comply
with changes in work practices implemented to reduce losses running at
ADollars 9.5m a year.
The dispute is expected to go before an arbitration commission tomorrow but
CRA said it would not continue to operate the mine at a loss. The mine, 40
per cent owned by Mitsubishi of Japan, produced 3m tonnes of steaming and
coking coal last year.

SUN ALLIANCE, the UK's biggest insurer, has announced a co-operation
agreement with the Lucky Insurance Company of South Korea, a part of the
industrial and commercial conglomerate, Lucky Goldstar.
Lucky is one of the largest non-life companies in Korea with total assets of
over Pounds 290m.
Sun Alliance will establish a representative office in Seoul, reinsure a
portion of Lucky's local business and insure some of its overseas
subsidiaries.
The two companies will also exchange technical and market information. Sun
Alliance is interested in the long-term prospects of sales in the rapidly
growing South Korean life insurance market.
Contact with Lucky was made via Wm McGee, a US underwriting agency, owned by
Sun Alliance, which handles Lucky's US business.
The deal is the third announced by Sun Alliance in the Far east in the last
six months. Last December it established a new general insurance subsidiary
in Indonesia in association with leading local business interests. In
January it increased its share of the New Zealand market by buying a local
subsidiary of the Guardian Royal Exchange.
Sun Alliance also has a co-operation agreement with the Japanese company,
Taisho.

FT  14 MAY 91 / UK Company News: The hidden timebomb in the convertible
package / Explore issuing companies' varying approaches to dealing with the
put option problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT SEEMED a good idea at the time. In the bull market of 1987 a number of
companies issued convertible Eurobonds.
They took advantage of rising share prices to set conversion prices at well
above their then share prices.
Further, they shaved the interest payments on the bonds by offering
investors the right to redeem them, usually after five years, at a premium
to the issue price.
This would guarantee the bondholders a return roughly in line with interest
rates at the time.
But, the issuers thought, these put options were never going to be
exercised. By the time they were due, the share price would have risen, the
bonds would have been converted.
The companies would have issued equity, and they hoped, the holders of the
new shares would have been drawn from the pool of international investors
who buy Eurobonds, thus widening the shareholder base.
Now it is all too obvious that there was a flaw in this logic.
The stockmarket crash of October 1987 meant that the share prices of many
companies fell well below the conversion prices. Suddenly the put option,
which had seemed unimportant, loomed as a potential liability.
As 1992 approached, the year when many of these options become payable,
companies realised they had problems. Unfortunately many of them also fell
on difficult times.
The prospect of a large liability worsened the outlook for companies already
facing poor trading conditions, or reaping the whirlwinds of ill-judged
expansions.
Certainly it was not the instrument itself which was at fault, but the
mistakes of the issuers.
The existence of a convertible with a put option became enough, in some
cases, to trigger a bear raid on the company's shares.
In the case of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the advertising group, with its Pounds
176.5m convertible Europreference shares due to be redeemed for Pounds 211m
in July 1993, the liability would have been sufficient to put the company
into receivership.
Now most of issuers have found an answer, if not a solution, to the problem.
These answers range from conversion as planned, to a complete refinancing of
the company.
The essence of any such answer is to give the issuer the ability to meet any
likely redemption without straining its balance sheet.
THE WHAT PROBLEM
SOLUTION
Last year Tesco, the food retailer, was able to force its convertible
holders to convert to shares because the group's share price had risen well
above the conversion price.
This is the ideal answer, since it was the outcome intended when the bonds
were first issued. The company has in effect borrowed cheaply for three
years - Tesco's convertible paid interest at 4 per cent - and has increased
its share capital at a price higher than it was at the time of issue.
THE GRIN AND
BEAR IT ANSWER
Many issuers have decided there is nothing for it but to pay up if or when
the put is exercised.
Most are providing for the extra interest which would be due, adding to
their interest charges, with the provision usually accumulating in creditors
in the balance sheet.
Thus, if a put option is exercised, there should not be a sudden charge to
profits, although the cash will have to be found and the bond refinanced.
Providing is not an answer on its own, issuers must also find the cash for
redemption.
One side effect of making the provision is that, as Tesco discovered, having
set supplemental interest against its profits, it could only bring the
provision back into reserves, not profits, in its latest balance sheet.
THE BUY-BACK
With many of the convertible bonds trading well below their issue prices,
companies have been able to buy some of them back, cutting their liability
on exercise of the put. Storehouse and Next, the retailers, have both tried
this route. Not surprisingly, bonds which have been languishing suddenly
spring to life when a company announces a buy-back programme, so issuers
cannot always retrieve much of the issue.
Storehouse was able to buy Pounds 40.5m of its Pounds 69m convertible issue
last autumn. It even made a Pounds 400,000 profit on the transaction. That
leaves only Pounds 28.5m of the issue outstanding, which will cost the
company Pounds 36.8m in April 1992 if the put is exercised, much less than
the original liability of Pounds 89m.
Next has two issues outstanding, and has bought some of each, with purchases
of its larger 5 3/4 per cent bond made recently. It now has Pounds 78.6m of
that issue outstanding, and Pounds 43.3m of its 6 3/4 per cent issue. That
would present liabilities of Pounds 57.8m in January 1992 and Pounds 104.8m
in October 1992.
THE SALE OF ASSETS
WAY OUT
Companies which could not put off the liability, could at least prepare for
it by raising cash. Storehouse has reformed its balance sheet through asset
sales, and should have minimal net debt when its March 31 accounts are
published. It should not have a problem in meeting the put in April 1992.
Next's sale of Grattan, its mail-order subsidiary, for Pounds 168m will give
it net cash until the October 1992 payment is made, and it now has agreed
facilities from its banks.
THE ROLLING PUT WHEEZE
Corporate financiers who had helped companies get into a mess by issuing the
bonds originally, tried to help them out by inventing the 'rolling put'.
This idea was to put off the evil day by offering bondholders an attractive
incentive to stay with their investments. When the first put date arrived,
they would be offered another put perhaps five years later at a new interest
rate.
At first this seemed to excuse companies from providing for extra interest,
since it once again reduced the likelihood of the put being exercised. But
now many expect the first puts to be exercised. Burton, Hillsdown and Asda
each have rolling puts, but of these only Asda is now not providing
supplemental interest. Each expects to have no financial difficulty meeting
the redemption.
THE RIGHTS ISSUE
REPLACEMENT
If the bond is not to turn into shares, then a rights issue is another
answer. That was London International Group's idea when it launched a Pounds
61.6m rights in January. That not only provides the cash to repay its Pounds
50m convertible in March 1992, it also increases the group's equity.
Meanwhile LIG is providing for the extra interest.
THE TOTAL REFINANCING
DESPERATION MEASURE
Saatchi's problems were so severe that the only way out was to refinance the
group. Its Europreference shareholders were offered ordinary shares instead.
Such was the bargaining power of these holders that they now have 64 per
cent of the enlarged share capital.
It is all too easy to blame the bonds themselves or the corporate financiers
who dreamed them up for the problems which have arisen. But it is not their
fault if the money raised was used to finance dubious expansion, or if the
recession has shown up weaknesses in balance sheets. Companies in stable
sectors, such as food retailers, were better able to cope with the possible
liability than those in more cyclical businesses.
Nor should it be forgotten that even those issuers which are forced by
investors to redeem at a premium, have tapped a cheap source of funds
meanwhile.
Many of the redemption yields were set at between 8 1/2 and 10 per cent  -
and the cost of money has generally exceeded those levels throughout the
last five years.

ATTEMPTS BY several shareholders of EFG, which has interests in forestry and
home and leisure products, to remove Mr Alan Joynes as chief executive was
defeated for the second time at an EGM last week, writes Michiyo Nakamoto.
Management and certain shareholders of EFG have been locked in a battle over
the company's future since directors announced their intention to dispose of
the core forestry business and concentrate instead on garden leisure
products.
EFG also warned that difficult trading conditions and high interest costs,
together with exceptional and extraordinary charges and provisions, were
expected to result in a loss of some Pounds 2.2m for the first half.
It added, however, that a reduction in borrowings and costs had placed it in
a better financial position to withstand the recession.
In the year to September 30, EFG reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 84,000,
compared with a profit of Pounds 2.01m previously, as high interest charges
on borrowings of over Pounds 9m took their toll. The final dividend was
passed.
A second resolution seeking to declare the payment of a dividend was, by
consensus, not put to the meeting.

FT  14 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Butler Cox recommends Pounds 14m bid from
US group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER and ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUTLER COX, the London-based management consulting company specialising in
information technology, is to be sold to Computer Sciences Corporation of
the US in a cash deal worth Pounds 14.3m.
CSC, a large computer systems integration company with an international
reputation for large industrial and government projects, said yesterday that
it had agreed to pay 245p per share for the entire share capital of Butler
Cox.
Following the statement shares in Butler Cox virtually doubled from 131p to
230p. The company was floated on the London stock market in May 1989 at
175p. Butler Cox directors, who between them hold 36.7 per cent of the
capital, are unanimously recommending acceptance of the offer.
Mr George Cox, managing director, said yesterday that 'the price reflects
the potential of the business.'
He said the downturn in the UK economy had hit both the level of
profitability and the share price which had made it impossible for Butler
Cox to make acquisitions using its own paper.
However, he pointed out that the company remained profitable, had grown in
cash and had avoided compulsory redundancies.
In its last financial Butler Cox experienced a 42 per cent fall in taxable
profits to Pounds 760,425 (Pounds 1.32m) on turnover up nearly 15 per cent
to Pounds 10.73m. CSC, with headquarters in Los Angeles, had net income last
year of Dollars 65m (Pounds 38m) on turnover of Dollars 1.7bn.
The two companies said that Butler Cox's presence in Europe would complement
CSC's strength in North America.
Butler Cox is unique in its sector in that its conventional consultancy
activities are underpinned by a syndicated research foundation.
Members of the Butler Cox Foundation include many of the most prestigious
companies in the UK and mainland Europe, brought together by a common
concern to make the best use of information technology.
Last year Butler Cox added an education arm through the purchase of
Cranfield Information Technology Institute.
CSC announced two years ago that it intended to grow the commercial side of
its business through acquisition and had set aside a war chest of Dollars
500m for purchases world-wide.
It already owns Index, a consultancy with offices in Boston, Los Angeles,
New York and London with strong links to Harvard and to Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
The US company said its intention was to bring together Butler Cox and Index
to form a global consulting group. The two companies have a total of some
800 companies worldwide subscribing to their research programmes.

FT  14 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Discontinued activities behind loss at
Cronite
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOSSES arising from discontinued businesses, two of which were placed into
administrative receivership, resulted in Cronite Group, the Birmingham-based
industrial holding company, plunging into loss at the interim stage.
For the six months to March 31, the group posted a loss before tax of Pounds
2.21m compared with a previous profit of Pounds 781,000. The deficit stemmed
from a trading loss of Pounds 1.88m at four businesses which the group has
discontinued.
Cronite Alloys, which recycles stainless steel, and Abtex, which makes fire
extinguishers, were placed into administrative receivership at the request
of the company.
The move came after it emerged that Alloys had a shortfall in expected
income of about Pounds 400,000 while the value of certain of its stocks had
been overstated in management accounts. The group also decided that Abtex,
where it discovered thefts approaching Pounds 1m, could not be returned to
profitability without greater financial resources than it had envisaged.
Mr Jim Butler, chairman, said efforts were being concentrated on a capital
reconstruction programme for which the group hoped to come up with proposals
by the year end.
The other businesses being discontinued were Hy Tech Machining and North
American Cronite.
Trading profits of the businesses being continued, which include Cronite
Castings and Atkinson, a manufacturer of fabrications, fell to Pounds
327,000 (Pounds 1.48m) with the group being hit by difficult conditions in
the UK and the high value of sterling which hindered exports.
Turnover amounting to Pounds 22.57m comprised Pounds 11.94m from continued
businesses and Pounds 10.64m from discontinued operations.

THE APPOINTMENT of receivers at a subsidiary of West Industries, the heavily
indebted engineering and construction group, not only threatens the group's
attempt to return to financial health, it also jeopardises its ability to
survive as an independent entity.
Svenska Handelsbanken, the Swedish bank, appointed administrative receivers
at Audit &amp; General, after it failed to clear a Pounds 5.8m overdraft. West
acquired A&amp;G, an engineering, nursing homes and property group, and five
subsidiary businesses in March.
The move by Svenska was a blow to West, which was in the final stages of
negotiations with its principal bankers, with a view to converting
approximately Pounds 3m of debt into redeemable preference shares. This swap
would have allowed a rights issue to raise about Pounds 3m to proceed.
More seriously, several other of West's businesses were used as collateral
against the Svenska debt. Unless West's banks agree to take on this debt,
calling in the outstanding collateral could have a domino effect on the
other businesses.
The decision by Svenska, which had been privy to West's refinancing
discussions, has prompted West to file a complaint with the Bank of England.
Mr Chris Charlton, chairman of West, said: 'We are highly displeased with
the actions of the bank, which were inappropriate and precipitous. It
breaches the clearing rules recently laid down by the Bank of England
recommending that banks give due time to any company with restructuring or
refinancing plans to allow those plans to go ahead.'
Had Svenska been willing to wait a week or even a day, the situation could
have been cleared, he added. Instead Svenska, which is fully secured against
its loans, chose to lay its claims on A&amp;G's assets.
Svenska's relationship with A&amp;G had been rocky for some time. Part of the
debt was to be repaid through the disposal of the nursing home businesses.
The sale was, however, blocked by Svenska, presumably on the grounds that
the net assets were worth more than the Pounds 3.9m being paid.
For its part, A&amp;G had not always been helpful in providing the bank with
financial information and interest payments had been late from time to time.
The demise of its subsidiary is the latest in a series of upsets that has
befallen West in recent years. Since it was bought in 1987 in a reverse
takeover by Celtic Haven, an engineer and building contractor, its history
has involved numerous twists and turns.
It began as a pest control and machinery testing business but was
transformed after major management changes in 1988, into an assortment of
businesses with a growing leaning towards leisure. Throughout 1989-1990, the
company embarked on a less-than-successful acquisition spree, buying into
restaurants in London and the US in its attempt to build up its leisure
side.
However, by the time it acquired A&amp;G, the group was already reviewing its
leisure operations. The purchase was part of a restructuring programme aimed
at bringing the group's focus back to light engineering.
During this time its share price plunged from a high of 79 1/2 p on March 27
1987, just after it was floated, to 2p at yesterday's close. In the year to
June 30, the group incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.79m, against profits
of Pounds 1.32m. Group borrowings of approximately Pounds 18.5m compare with
net assets of about Pounds 9m.
A&amp;G's history is no less colourful. It was bought by Humberside Electronic
Controls in 1988 in a reverse takeover, and embarked on a buying binge
throughout 1989 which left it with several engineering companies, nursing
homes and properties.
A&amp;G's last reported results showed a pre-tax loss of Pounds 646,000 in the
year to the end of June. Borrowings totalled Pounds 7.74m at the year-end,
against net assets of Pounds 5.56m.
Nevertheless, there are some grounds for hope at West. Mr Charlton
emphasised that the group's other banks were fully supportive. The
receivership relieved the company of considerable debt owed by A&amp;G, and
'there are precedents for rescue operations that actually achieved better
results for a company in this kind of situation,' said Mr Piers Harford at
Albert E Sharp, West's financial advisers.
There was a possibility, for example, that West could re-acquire two of the
businesses from the receivers, for no increase in its gearing, he said.
Mr Piers admitted that there had not been many successful examples of such
'Texas cavalry rescues' and there was no knowing whether West and its
financial advisers could achieve success in the present banking environment.
'Even in 1974 there was nothing like this mass walking away of banks,' he
said.

buy-in
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
County NatWest, the merchant banking arm of National Westminster Bank, has
completed a Pounds 25.7m management buy-in of a group of eight hotels.
The company is to be known as Lyric Hotels and the transaction involved the
simultaneous acquisition of the hotels from four vendors.
Lyric has been formed by Mr Alan Goodenough, who will be managing director,
and Mr Norman Jones, finance director. Both worked in the Character Hotels
division of Pleasurama, subsequently taken over by Mecca Leisure.
Mr Nat Solomon, a former chairman of Pleasurama, will join the Lyric board
as non-executive chairman.
Equity of Pounds 11.1m was arranged by County NatWest Ventures and was
invested in the form of ordinary shares, subordinated loan notes and deep
discount loan stock.

FT  14 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Sanderson Electronics dips
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SANDERSON Electronics, the computing services group which graduated from the
USM to a full listing in January, experienced a profits fall of Pounds
280,000 to Pounds 1.5m pre-tax for the half year ended March 31.
The associates' contribution fell to Pounds 337,000 (Pounds 649,000) while
interest charges accounted for Pounds 118,000 more at Pounds 264,000. The 16
per cent profits downturn was struck from a turnover Pounds 4.16m higher at
Pounds 10.61m.
Earnings per share declined by 3p to 11p.
The company now pays two interim dividends and a second payment of 3.3p
makes an 8.7p total for the 1990-91 year. For the 1989-90 year an interim of
3p was paid but there was no final.
However, the first interim for the period under review was paid on the day
the final would have been paid.
Mr Paul Thompson, chairman, said that comparing the amounts paid in the
calendar years, 8.7p is being paid in 1991 against 8.4p in 1990.
Looking ahead, Mr Thompson said immediate progress in the UK continued to
depend on the effects of the recession.
He pointed out, however, that the group was well positioned with its
associates to continue to expand its activities on an international basis as
opportunities arose.
The shares closed 13p higher at 138p.

FT  14 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Doctus to sell marketing arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOCTUS, the management and personnel consultancy, is negotiating the sale of
Wallace Group, its marketing subsidiary. Discussions are at an early stage,
but if the deal comes off, it could more than wipe out Doctus' Pounds 25m
debt, writes Jane Fuller.
Wallace came into Doctus in June 1989 through the Pounds 26m merger with
Prospective, formerly the Pineapple Group. The all-share deal brought in a
considerable amount of debt.
Prospective had acquired Wallace, a US-based group, in 1988 and the merger
with Doctus had saved it paying up to Pounds 43.75m in shares as a deferred
consideration.
Mr Brian Blake, chairman of Doctus, said at the time of the Prospective deal
that he wanted to build up a diversified business services group. Marketing
accounted for 60 per cent of operating profit last year.
Last month Doctus issued a profit warning for the six months to March 31 and
announced that it had decided to focus on management consultancy and 'human
resources', a technical staff agency, career counselling and training -
hence the question-mark over the marketing side.
A shake-up of management also saw Mr Blake shed the chief executive's role.
Doctus' share price has fallen from 138p to 33p since last May. It gained 1p
yesterday.

FT  14 MAY 91 / UK Company News: IMI warns of profit fall in 1991 first half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMI, the international engineering group, yesterday warned shareholders that
pre-tax profits for the first half would be lower than in 1990, and that
full year results were unlikely to match those of last year. The shares
closed 3p lower at 233p, following a 6p fall on Friday
Sir Eric Pountain, the chairman, told the annual meeting in Birmingham that
it was difficult to predict the results with any degree of precision. Much
would depend on the timing of an upturn in the US and UK economies.
'Personally I do not expect to see any recovery in IMI's trading before the
final quarter at the very earliest,' he said.
His gloomy view of the immediate trading prospects echoed those made last
week by Mr David Lees, chairman of GKN, who noted the falling away of demand
in the first quarter of 1991, continuing the trend of the latter months of
1990. Since then, Mr Lees said, there had been few signs of improvement, and
first half results would be down on the second half of 1990.
These two views emphasised the gulf between engineering industry leaders and
the UK Government on the state of the economy. Government predictions of an
upturn in the middle of the year were not seen as having a strong foundation
basis by those active in the marketplace.
Both GKN and IMI had been engaged in cost reduction exercises. Mr Gary
Allen, chief executive at IMI, said this year the group would spend Pounds
50m on new equipment to increase productivity. Both, too, have cut the size
of their payrolls.
Mr Lees announced that in the first four months of this year GKN had cut
1,100 jobs. This reduced the number employees worldwide to 31,200 from the
end-1990 total, and followed a reduction of 3,600 jobs in 1990. Of the 1,100
jobs, 850 were in the UK.
IMI, with a total payroll of nearly 20,000, had announced or was planning
job losses of 1,000 this year.
In 1990, IMI made pre-tax profits of Pounds 115.1m and GKN produced Pounds
172m.

FT  14 MAY 91 / UK Company News: RMC strengthens stake in German housing
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RMC GROUP is strengthening its position in the growing German aerated
concrete market.
Its 63.6 per cent owned German subsidiary, Readymix Aktiengesellschaft fur
Beteiligungen (RMA), is paying Pounds 33.7m and merging its Durox aerated
concrete company with Ytong AG, one of Europe's biggest aerated concrete
products groups. This lifts RMA's stake in Ytong from 29.8 per cent to 82
per cent.
In a separate move an RMC associate, Readymix Berlin, has paid about DM25m
(Pounds 8.4m) for Laussig, which operates a factory in Leipzig in eastern
Germany producing about 300,000 cubic metres of aerated concrete annually.
Ytong, which will help manage the Leipzig plant, produced 1.85m cubic metres
of concrete last year from seven plants in Germany and one each in Austria,
France and Portugal.
Durox operates three factories in Holland and one in Belgium producing about
700,000 cubic metres of aerated concrete, which is used to produce
lightweight blocks used widely in housebuilding.
Germany is one of the few European housing markets expected to grow during
the next 12 months with residential development forecast to rise by about 6
per cent this year.
An important factor behind the increased demand has been the flow of
immigrants into the western part of the country from the former East
Germany.
In 1990 Ytong made pre-tax profits of DM31.3m (Pounds 10.5m) on sales of
DM450m (Pounds 152m). Mr Derek Jenkins, finance director of RMC, said the
purchase of an increased stake in Ytong would make a positive contribution
to the group's earnings this year.

<TEXT>
Difficult trading, almost doubled interest charges and provisions for bad
debts and reorganisation costs have pushed USM-quoted Westminster
Scaffolding into a loss of Pounds 82,000 for the year ended October 31 1990,
against a profit previously of Pounds 1.47m.
With losses per share of 1p (earnings 9.4p) the final dividend is omitted,
leaving the year's payment at 2p (3p).
Because of the situation in the property market the directors have decided
to sell certain properties for Pounds 5.87m, of which Pounds 2.83m in cash
is payable immediately, and to strengthen the capital base by raising Pounds
3.54m net through a 3-for-2 rights issue at 25p each.
Mr Tom Greenham, chairman, has undertaken to subscribe for 3.2m shares - 21
per cent of the issue.
The shares closed 5p down at 33p.

TILBURY GROUP, the construction and property combine, is selling two large
developments to a new joint venture, Tilbury Phoenix, to be owned with
Philipp Holzmann, the German contractor, and Girozentrale Bank of Vienna.
Holzmann already owns 29 per cent of Tilbury. Advanta, a German investment
group, holds a further 14 per cent. Holzmann and Girozentrale will take a 33
per cent stake in the venture.
The sale price of the two adjacent properties, The Phoenix Development and
St James' Business Park in Glasgow, is understood to be about Pounds 27m.
The sites comprise 300 acres for which planning permission has been granted
for a mixture of business, retail and industrial parks as well as for fast
food and hotel facilities.
Tilbury will retain a 67 per cent interest in the venture which will be
included as a subsidiary in its group accounts.
Mr Michael Bottjer, chief executive of Tilbury, said: 'The joint venture
strengthens our partnership with Holzmann. As well as being our largest
shareholder, Holzmann has indicated their support in a number of projects we
are considering - including the Novosur property joint venture in Madrid.'

Holmes Protection, the financ-ially stretched New York security and alarm
company quoted in London, has failed to secure the sale of its New Jersey
businesses.
The shares fell 1p to 1 1/2 p.
Alert, the buyer, told Holmes it could not proceed with the purchase as it

Holmes, which had extended the closing date for the deal by 90 days for
Alert to find financing, hoped to realise Dollars 17.5m-Dollars 18.5m from

The group had planned to use the proceeds to repay part of its Dollars 61m

Last month the group's accounts were qualified by its auditors subject to
the company's ability to continue as a going concern.

FT  14 MAY 91 / UK Company News: GKN plans French joint venture in AFV
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RATIONALISATION of the European armoured fighting vehicles market
accelerated yesterday as GKN Defence, the UK-based defence subsidiary of
GKN, and Giat Industries of France announced a possible joint-venture in the
medium armoured vehicle market.
The two companies have signed a memorandum of understanding to study the
feasibility of common solutions for the French and British markets. The
agreement, if successful, could secure GKN's future as a manufacturer of
armoured fighting vehicles (AFVs).
'With manufacturers as diverse as GKN, VSEL, USH's Alvis, Royal Ordnance and
Vickers, the British AFV market is grossly oversupplied,' explains Mr Sash
Tusa, a defence analyst at Robert Fleming. 'But in the long term, this deal
could open up the continental market to GKN and provide economies of scale
for joint Franco-British manufacture.'
The move follows encouragement from Mr Alan Clark, the defence procurement
minister, for increased co-operation in acquiring defence equipment between
France and the UK. The two countries have similar requirements for equipment
which can be used outside the Nato area and which is suitable for export.
The policy's aim is to reduce procurement costs.
Giat's decision to forge links with GKN follows a nine-month flurry of
alliances and expansion since it was made an independent group by the French
government last year.
In recent months, the group has reshaped the French AFV sector by signing
joint development and manufacturing accords with the other French AFV
companies, Creusot-Loire - an engineering subsidiary of Usinor-Sacilor, the
steelmaker - and Renault Vehicules Industriels, the truck-making unit of
Renault.
Mr Pierre Chiquet, Giat's chairman, said yesterday that the accord was in
keeping with the 'pattern of Europeanising armament land programmes and
companies'.

FT  14 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Deadline for Chelsea FC draws closer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEADLINE for Chelsea Football Club to decide whether to buy its Stamford
Bridge ground or leave it came closer to definition yesterday with the
appointment of an independent valuer.
The 11.7-acre site in Fulham Road is owned by Cabra Estates, which has been
in dispute with Chelsea's chairman Mr Ken Bates virtually since it acquired
the ground from Marler Estates in April 1989.
Mr William Wells, a partner in Chesterton, the London firm of surveyors, has
the job of determining the value of the ground in August 1988, when Chelsea
exercised an option giving it the right to buy at a price adjudicated by a
surveyor.
Mr Wells is expected to take four to six weeks to produce the valuation,
which is supposed to be binding on both parties. In March 1988 Savills,
another London firm, placed a figure of Pounds 40,000 on it, taking into
account Chelsea's tenancy (which expired in August 1989) and planning
consent for predominantly residential redevelopment. It has since been
revalued at Pounds 30m.
After Mr Wells has reached a decision, Chelsea will be given a reasonable
period - which Cabra reckons to be three months - to come up with the money.
This could, however, take the process into the next football season and Mr
John Duggan, chairman of Cabra, has indicated that he probably would not
evict the club in mid-season.
He said yesterday that he hoped the valuation would 'quickly resolve the
uncertainty that has hung over the site.'
Mr Bates was unavailable for comment.

FT  14 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Greenall Whitley edges up to Pounds 24.1m -
Change of name is intended to reflect change of identity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREENALL WHITLEY, which intends to change its name to Greenalls Group to
reflect its switch from regional brewer to national pubs and hotels
operator, yesterday reported interim pre-tax profits marginally higher at
Pounds 24.14m, against Pounds 23.74m.
Trading profit for the six months ended March 29 1991 increased by 10 per
cent to Pounds 21.25m (Pounds 19.32m) on turnover down by 7.4 per cent to
Pounds 225.5m (Pounds 243.46m).
Fully diluted earnings per share were unchanged at 12.6p but the interim
dividend is raised to 4.4p (4p).
With full provision made in last year's accounts for the brewery closures,
operating profits on pubs and brewing of Pounds 19.2m were not strictly
comparable with last year's Pounds 16.42m.
Mr Christopher Hatton, chairman, said he expected benefits from the closures
to result in a 'modest increase' over the full year.
'Trading performance in our pubs has been sustained despite the most
difficult economic conditions we have experienced in recent years,' he
added. Talks were being held with both national and regional brewers with a
view to extending and upgrading the pub estate, which was offering a wider
choice of beers to customers.
Mr Andrew Thomas, managing director, said yesterday that Pounds 25m-Pounds
30m was earmarked for this upgrading.
Operating profit on catering inns and restaurants of Pounds 2.18m (Pounds
1.9m) was adversely affected by a reduced level of activity in the
accommodation market; but the group's off-licences weathered the economic
difficulties well, raising their profit contribution to Pounds 1.45m (Pounds
1.29m).
The Gulf War and recession depressed the group's hotel trade in both the UK
and US. Operating profits were down from Pounds 8.35m in last year's buoyant
first half to Pounds 5.88m. A 5 per cent increase in room rates helped
compensate for a 6 per cent fall in occupancy.
Profit at the pre-tax level was hit by a fall in the level of property
disposals from Pounds 4.42m to Pounds 2.89m, but it benefited from a Pounds
1m reduction in interest charges on lower borrowings.
COMMENT
The trading performance of Greenall's pub estate over the half year is
flattered by the treatment of the costs of closing its breweries; but the
group appears to be getting off to a fair start on its chosen path as a pubs
and hotels operator. Management is focused on upgrading the pub estate.
Customers are already getting wider choice and margins are improving.
Despite continuing economic difficulties, improvement is also expected on
the hotels side from a combination of cost controls and sustained marketing.
Analysts do not seem inclined to quarrel with the group's claims to have
established a firm base for further progress. Full year pre-tax profits are
expected to be slightly above last year's Pounds 62.23m, with earnings per
share marginally down from 34.8p to 33.5p, putting the company on a
prospective p/e of 10.2.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Waiting for the eagle to strike again: Anheuser casts a
cautious eye on growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For more than a decade, Anheuser-Busch of the US, the world's biggest
brewer, has been expected to impose its bulky presence on the international
beer market.
Its intentions have been a constant source of speculation - most recently as
a possible bidder for Allied-Lyons, the UK food and drinks group.
Yet, although the St Louis-based brewer produces more than 100m hectolitres
of Budweiser, Busch, and Michelob beers a year - 40m hls more than the
entire UK beer production - it exports only 3 per cent of its output.
'Our current strategy is more cautious than bold,' Mr August Busch, the
chairman, admitted in the company's recent annual report. But he added:
'Longer term, the international beer mar-ket will become a more important
source of volume and profits.' For the next few years, however, Anheuser
will concentrate on the US domestic beer market where its potential growth
is still huge. It has led the US beer industry since 1957. Last year, it
increased its share of the total US market by two points to 43.7 per cent,
with net sales worth Dollars 7.3bn (Pounds 4bn).
Anheuser now sells twice as much beer as its nearest rival, Miller Brewing,
owned by Philip Morris, the US foods and tobacco group.
The concentration of the US industry is continuing. Anheuser, Miller, and
third-ranked Adolph Coors, account for 75 per cent of the market.
In the next five years, the three groups will control 85 per cent, Mr Jerry
Ritter, Anheuser's chief financial and administrative officer, confidently
predicts.
'Anheuser is well on track to achieve its goal of a 50 per cent market share
by the mid-1990s,' he says.
Its progress towards that priority target appears relentless. First-quarter
sales this year suggest that Anheuser has taken a doubling of excise tax on
beer in its stride, just as it coped with last year's price discounting by
competitors.
Its interests in theme parks, food products, can manufacturing and baseball
 -the company owns the St Louis Cardinals - do not distract from its
commitment to brewing.
Its brand marketing is aggressive, sustained and richly funded. Last year,
it spent Dollars 613m on advertising. It has a dedicated nationwide
distribution system.
Budweiser brands account for one in every three beers sold in the US. More
than half the country's 80m beer drinkers aged between 21 and 27 years are
Bud consumers.
Anheuser has also not been afraid to innovate. Bud Dry Draft, a beer with
less sugar and no aftertaste was launched nationally last year and sold 3m
barrels. The beer was judged one of the most successful new product
introductions in the industry's history, even though some of its sales were
gained from other Budweiser brands. This year, Anheuser is test marketing
two new Michelob brands. 'We are developing new products to meet new tastes
and segmenting the market further,' says Mr Ritter.
With US brewers such as Stroh and Heileman losing share and the beer market
still growing, if slowly, Mr Ritter calculates that there will be up to 5m
barrels a year of new business to be won up to the middle of the decade.
Against that background, he says: 'There is no great sense of urgency about
plunging into high-risk areas overseas.' For the moment, at least, there is
no inclination to change tactics by striking boldly to capture a brewer such
as Allied-Lyons.
'We are quite willing to make investments in brewing assets abroad,' says Mr
Ritter, 'so long as we can maintain our pattern of seeking a fair return on
capital for shareholders.'
The 'outrageous' prices paid over recent years for UK and European breweries
would make that impossible.
'There will be opportunities later to buy assets, if necessary, at
reasonable prices,' he suggests.
Anheuser's international progress so far has been made mainly through
licensing agreements with national brewers. These include Suntory in Japan,
its largest export market, GrandMet in the UK, Guinness in Ireland, Labatt
in Canada, Carlsberg in Denmark, and Oriental Brewing in South Korea.
Such agreements have generally worked well. Budweiser is the leading
international brand in Japan with 60 per cent of the category.
In Canada, it has captured 4 per cent of the beer market. Sales in Ireland
grew 52 per cent last year; and in the UK, which accounts for 80 per cent of
its European sales of 657,000 hls annually, Budweiser is one of the fastest
growing premium lagers.
The licensed brewers take a large share of the profits, however, and the
uncertainties of such agreements was illustrated by the acquisition of Grand
Metropolitan's breweries this year by Courage, the UK's second-largest
brewer. Mr Ritter confesses that this deal, which put Anheuser's Budweiser
in the same portfolio as its US rival's Miller Lite, has caused 'very great
concern'.
Anheuser is discussing the situation with Courage and seems to have decided
that, because of Miller's different positioning as a standard lager, it may
be able to live with the arrangement.
Courage, however, will have to provide some guarantees. 'The key factor,'
says Mr Ritter, 'is the amount of attention that our brand will get. We have
to ensure that it does not come to be seen as just one in a herd of premium
lagers.'
Anheuser sees 'great opportunities' for the future in the UK and continental
Europe as the brewing industry restructures, trade barriers come down, and
former communist states move to market-based economies.
It is optimistic about resolving its long-standing trademark dispute with
Czechoslovakia's Budweiser brewery and perhaps developing some form of joint
venture.
To strengthen its position in Europe generally, Anheuser established its own
sales, distribution, and marketing organisation covering 17 countries last
year.
European sales volumes promptly rose 20 per cent. Budweiser is now listed by
all the UK's leading brewers, and the foundations for future growth have
been reinforced by its introduction into Greece, Sweden and Belgium.
'By moving slowly, we have gained knowledge of, and experience in, foreign
markets without tying up significant capital,' says Mr Ritter.
'We feel confident that we now know the market inside out,' he adds. Bullish
words, perhaps, but competitors may well detect an ominous note.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Schneider wins Square D battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SCHNEIDER, the French electrical equipment group, has won a battle lasting
almost three months to take over its US competitor, Square D, following a
12.5 per cent improvement to Dollars 2.23bn (Pounds 1.29bn) in the value of
its bid.
The French company said yesterday that it had reached agreement with Square
D on an offer of Dollars 88 a share. This compares with Schneider's initial
offer of Dollars 78 a share, and represents an increase of Dollars 250m in
the overall value of the deal.
Square D's management has fought bitterly against the Schneider bid since it
was launched in February, but it was forced to negotiate after the US
Department of Justice announced last Friday that it had no anti-trust
objections to the deal.
The government's decision was believed to be an indication that Square D
would lose its legal battle against the merger. It was pressing an
anti-trust lawsuit in a US District Court in New York, which has now been
withdrawn.
Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, Schneider's chairman, immediately flew to New
York with his bankers, Lazard Freres, to meet Mr Jerre Stead, chairman of
Square D, and his advisers, Goldman Sachs.
Square D will now drop its lawsuits against Schneider, which will withdraw
the list of candidates it had put up against the current board.
Mr Pineau-Valencienne said yesterday that the deal would create one of the
world's leading groups in the production of low- and medium-tension
electrical distribution equipment, and would also considerably strengthen
his group's position in the field of industrial robots.
He said that the additional Dollars 10 a share was justified by the
successful conclusion of a friendly agreement, as well as by the improvement
in economic conditions in the US.
'At Dollars 88, the price works out at 19.2 times 1990 earnings per share,
where the market values the sector at an average of 18.9 times. On book
value, we are paying 2.8 times book, compared with a sector average of 2.6.
In other words, we are buying the company in dollars at the market price,
without a control premium,' he said.
The cost of the takeover will be funded half from money provided by
Schneider and by its subsidiaries Merlin Gerin and Telemecanique, and half
by a bank loan provided by Societe Generale and Paribas.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Berlin's back against the wall: The struggle to create a
European aviation centre and an east-west gateway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pigeons still fly and nest in the large aircraft hangar at the run-down
airport of Schoenefeld in what used to be East Berlin.
Although Lufthansa has spent DM20m (Pounds 6.7m) modernising the old hangar
to turn it into a maintenance base for Boeing 737 jets, the airline has so
far failed to remove all the pigeons. The investment reflects both the
ambitions and difficulties of Lufthansa, which, in the words of its chairman
Mr Heinz Ruhnau, wants to transform Berlin into 'a new centre of European
aviation and a gateway between east and west', following the unification of
the two Germanys.
Lufthansa returned to Berlin last October after a 45-year absence. It was an
emotional moment. The airline was founded in Berlin in 1926. After the
second world war, it was shut out from its home base with only the allied
airlines, including British Airways, Air France and Pan American, allowed to
use the three air corridors between Berlin and what was West Germany.
The German flag carrier has wasted little time in re-establishing itself in
Berlin. 'From zero, we now operate 286 weekly flights into Berlin,' said Mr
Ruhnau, whose successor as Lufthansa chairman is expected to be announced
tomorrow. But the euphoria has been tempered by the practical difficulties
of the reunification process and, in the case of Lufthansa, of recreating a
base in the city.
Schoenefeld is just one example. 'The hangar was in a dreadful state,' said
Mr Karl-Friedrich Rausch, Lufthansa's manager for aircraft maintenance in
Berlin. He was walking around the maintenance plant which, until this year,
was used by Interflug, the former East German airline which has just stopped
its scheduled flights. 'We called in the Rentokil people but there are still
some pigeons left,' he added.
But the pigeons are the least of Lufthansa's worries in trying to expand its
operations. The airline was planning to use Schoenefeld to launch new
international services from Berlin because there was no room for expansion
at the congested airport of Tegel in the former western part of the city.
'We started a service to New York this year but were forced to drop it. No
one wanted to fly from Schoenefeld because of the state of the airport,'
explained a Lufthansa official. Plans to improve and modernise Schoenefeld
are in limbo. Mr Ruhnau is now campaigning for the construction of an
airport 30 miles south of Berlin on the site of the present Soviet military
air base of Sperenberg. This would provide the necessary infrastructure to
meet the expected growth in air travel demand in the Berlin area. Even if he
succeeds in persuading the authorities, it will take years to build the
airport.
Berlin's problem is acute. At present Tegel handles nearly 7m passengers a
year, while Schoenefeld serves about 3m passengers largely with flights
operated by east European carriers. 'By the year 2005, we expect demand in
Berlin to rise to about 30m,' Mr Ruhnau said. 'Tegel could be enlarged but
because it is in the middle of the city it cannot be expanded to handle more
than 7m passengers a year. Schoenefeld could be expanded to serve 12m to 13m
passengers a year but faces big problems. Berlin basically needs a new
airport.'
But it is not only the lack of adequate new airport capacity which risks
clipping Lufthansa's ambitions. The current state of disarray of the Soviet
and east European economies is expected to delay the development of
east-west air travel.
As the national flag carrier, Lufthansa faces the additional political
pressure of helping to provide employment and new economic opportunities for
former East Germans. 'The wall has come down but a new economic poverty wall
has been erected between the rich west and the poor eastern side,' said a
member of the Berlin Senate.
Mr Ruhnau originally proposed to acquire a 26 per cent stake in Interflug
and to absorb it gradually into the Lufthansa family. But the Treuhand, the
body charged with selling or closing east German companies, as well as the
German cartel office were opposed to the deal because they feared it would
give Lufthansa a monopoly in Berlin.
British Airways also showed an interest in buying a large stake in Interflug
to help preserve its position in the Berlin market after unification. But BA
was never able to see the Interflug accounts to help it decide whether to
make such an investment. Instead BA, now facing intense competition from
Lufthansa on internal German airline services, plans to form a new
German-based airline with German banks and other financial institutions.
Lufthansa was not prepared to wait for the Treuhand to change its mind and
allow it to buy a stake in Interflug. It decided to develop its new Berlin
hub alone. It bought for Dollars 150m the internal German services of Pan
Am, the US carrier desperate for cash; negotiated a new agreement with Air
France to take over the management of the joint Euro-Berlin airline
subsidiary set up three years ago under French control to offer flights out
of Berlin; and launched a series of services to Germany and other
international destinations.
The airline has hired almost 1,000 former Interflug employees, including 450
at its Schoenefeld maintenance facility, to staff its Berlin operations.
'I'm not responsible for Interflug but we have always tried to help the
people of Interflug,' Mr Ruhnau said. But with the demise of the former East
German airline, Lufthansa is being pressed to hire more Interflug employees.
Interflug was heavily over-staffed like other East German enterprises. ' All
East German companies had two chains of employment. One was the management,
the other the party,' said Mr Ruhnau. 'At Interflug there were four chains:
a secret service chain and an army chain as well.'
More than 6,000 people were employed by Interflug. There are still about
2,800 who have yet to find new jobs. This includes 215 pilots. 'I don't know
how it will be possible to retrain these pilots to fly western aircraft,' Mr
Ruhnau said. However, Lufthansa has just set up a company to help retrain
Interflug employees with the backing and funding of Germany's national
employment organisation.
'The company will make an offer to all employees still with Interflug to get
new qualifications to give them a better chance of finding a job in the
airline or service-related industries. If air traffic in Berlin picks up and
we have a demand for additional people, newly qualified Interflug employees
will get priority,' Mr Ruhnau explained.
Despite the enormous economic uncertainties facing the fledgling eastern
democracies, and the current turmoil in the airline industry, Mr Ruhnau is
convinced Lufthansa's strategy of expanding in both east and west Europe
will ultimately pay off. He expects the east-west European airline market to
show higher than average growth over the next 20 years, of 10.4 per cent a
year, compared with about 5-6 per cent for the industry as a whole.
'We are already the market leader and we will strengthen our position
because all these countries are our neighbours and Germany already offers
the majority of airline seats to east Europe,' he said. Lufthansa is now
discussing close co-operation with LOT, the Polish airline, and an agreement
is expected this summer.
Mr Ruhnau has a long-term vision. 'The old expression of eastern and western
Europe will disappear in a few years,' he said. 'Before the war we had a
continental Europe or rather a middle Europe which was a source of great
wealth. This will appear again and Berlin will be in the middle of it.'
'Look,' he added, 'Czechoslovakia once had the highest living standard in
Europe. This will come again. History and tradition are much more important
than some short-term thinking. All this opens new opportunities for
Lufthansa.'
Most of his own senior managers are more cautious. At present, 90 per cent
of Berlin traffic is domestic German traffic, explained Mr Klaus Nittinger,
the head of Lufthansa's passenger services. The international network out of
Berlin remains weak. 'The growth of this network will be gradual. The west
Berlin population is only 2m and cannot generate enough traffic to create a
big market. The surrounding market is still pretty weak because the money is
not there,' he added.
But Mr Ruhnau believes he will confound the sceptics once more. At his
company's annual meeting in Berlin in 1984, he was ridiculed for saying:
'The day will come when Lufthansa will again fly to an undivided Berlin.'
Even if his latest prediction proves correct, Mr Ruhnau, who will be
retiring next year, will leave a formidable task for his successor.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Letter: The enterprise culture in Paraguay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANTONIO ESPINOZA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is so seldom that Paraguay gets press coverage in Britain, that it
is disappointing that your correspondent Christina Lamb gives your readers a
rather distorted view of my country in her article, 'Paraguay finds old
habits die hard', (May 9).
Street vendors do hawk French perfumes and Japanese electronics, but should
one presume they are contraband? Smuggling had been endemic during the
Stroessner regime, and one of the first measures of the new government of
president Rodriguez was to cut the tariffs on these and most other consumer
luxuries to 7 per cent - removing the incentive to smuggle, and practically
ending the illegal import of these goods.
The high tariff barriers of our neighbours do, naturally, make shopping in
Paraguay very attractive, generating an important regional tourist trade.
This has helped to sustain our growth rate in spite of the major adjustments
that have had to be made as state subsidies and other forms of government
intervention are removed from the economy.
In fact, the World Bank estimates our gross domestic product growth for 1990
at 5.1 per cent, not the zero growth stated in your article.
Of course the after-effects of 35 years of autocratic rule cannot be wished
away, and the struggle to perfect our democratic institutions, our human
rights record and the liberal-isation of the economy continues. Gigantic
strides in this direction have already been made, and we shall persist.
My government remains as committed as ever to supporting the creative forces
of free enterprise in a truly democratic environment.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Letter: No car, but a better pension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From B F BERRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte analysis of the alternative ways of
funding cars for employees (Management, May 10) appears to have overlooked
one significant cost in the case of an increased salary. This salary would
almost certainly be pensionable and so would require contributions in the
order of 15 per cent. If the pension scheme were contributory, some cost
would fall on the employee, for which tax relief would be available.
However, the bulk of the cost, upwards of 10 per cent of salary, would fall
on the employer, considerably reducing the alleged net gain to the employer
as shown. To the employee, the substitution of a car by a salary increase
must be an added attraction if it also enhances the pension.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, With reference to Observer's comments about the government decision to
move the Department of Employment's key policy unit for small firms to
Sheffield ('Faraway Faceless', May 3), his obvious bias against the north
does him no credit.
The decision to move any government department out of the over-crowded and
over-rated south is to be welcomed. Here in the north-west, our only regret
is that the decision did not involve Stockport or Preston or Chester or
Blackburn. Despite emotive words such as 'exile' the lifestyle north of
Watford can only be described as excellent.
On his implied concern about the potential communication difficulties
between government departments and ministers, distance has never struck me
as a problem. The 'Sir Humphrey' syndrome seems more apposite and that
happens whatever the distance.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Letter: Stabilisation in new democracies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms STEPHANY GRIFFITH-JONES and Mr JOHN TOYE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Martin Wolf's article, 'Poland's struggle for stability', (May 9)
raises many interesting issues for stabilisation policy. But his claim that
the success of stabilisation and authoritarian regimes are causally linked
is highly dubious.
It runs counter not only to the views of the World Bank and the ESRD, but
also to the results of academic social science. Haggard and Kauffman at
Harvard found established democracies to be no less prudent in
macro-management than authoritarian regimes. One of us has just participated
in a nine-country study which rejected authoritarianism as a necessary
condition for good structural adjustment (Aid and Power, Routledge, 1991).
A good example of a new democracy managing stabilisation well is Chile. The
Aylwin government's inflation forecast for 1991 of 15 per cent seems to us
realistic - and it is well below the 25 per cent prevailing during the last
years of the Pinochet government.
Martin Wolf's economic analysis is good enough to need no support from
half-baked political science.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Arts: Sacred Symphony - Sadler's Wells
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oliver Hindle is the newest choreographer to emerge
from the Royal Ballet. A young dancer with the Birmingham troupe, he has
made some workshop essays, and on Friday night we saw the premiere of his
first professional work, Sacred Symphony. His musical text is Andrzej
Panufnik's Sinfonia sacra, a score whose clear musical voice hymns the
millennium of Polish Christianity and statehood. Hindle's concern seems with
the survival of faith in
prayer, set against imagery expressive of national
identity forged through suffering.
He begins well, with four male soloists whose leaps echo the trumpet
fanfares of Panufnik's first movement, and then brings on a group of
grieving and contemplative women. So far, so brave in vision. The language
is serious, classically direct, somewhat reminiscent of Massine's symphonic
style. Jan Blake's restrained
design of two pendant banners, with the dancers
in autumnal, earthy colours, is handsome.
But the score, and the rather static inspiration behind the ballet, do not
allow much further choreographic development, and the later sections of the
piece rely too much on those ecstatic lifts and communings which MacMillan
uses so powerfully (because so intimately
allied to the language of the Mass) in Requiem. Yet Mr Hindle, speaks with
his own voice, and poetically, and
I want to see his next
works. He is well served by his cast.
The other novelty of the evening was Paul Taylor's Airs. It is good to our
national ballet essaying mainstream American dance, and Airs, with its
springy steps and evident delight in its Handel score, is an apt choice. On
Friday it was rather reverentially done - with Taylor's troupe it looks so
fresh as to be almost improvisatory - but let BRB's interpreters relax their
attitudes to it (and their torsos) and it will gain that sense of joyous
spontaneity that makes it such a delight. Marion Tait, in her solos, has the
right physical grace and happily natural air.
And to close this programme - well worth seeing - Ashton's Valses nobles and
Facade. I suppose Valses nobles should really only be given by dancers in
their late 'teens, the bloom of innocence quite as necessary to it as the
bloom of Ashton style. It is a tiny, quiet marvel, and I love watching it,
and the current cast is adept at suggesting the sudden joys (and the
evanescent shadows) of this party where the moment is very sweet. Facade
looked a bit boisterous on Friday: it needs to be treated with more dead-pan
humour and driest wit.
And for the Dago, someone as wickedly funny as Robert Helpmann must be
found, to destroy the audience with a raised eye-brow and too many diamond
rings.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Arts: The Greek Passion - Opera Du Rhin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mulhouse, a quiet town in southern Alsace where the Opera du Rhin has just
been presenting Martinu's The Greek Passion, is far from the madding cry of
international opera. The theatre, a perfectly-scaled building tucked down a
little street off the town centre, was built in 1887 and lovingly restored
for its centenary. The town has its own part-time orchestra, and
performances tend to be as unpretentious as the audiences. But over the
years in this same small theatre, I've heard Alain Vainzo as a stylish
Werther, a noble Fidelio with Klaus Konig as Florestan, and the only modern
production of Massenet's Griselidis.
The fact that Martinu can be successfully played in this French provincial
backwater says something not just about local taste and the way it has been
educated by the Strasbourg-based Opera du Rhin, but also about the impact of
last year's Martinu centenary: surely no composer in the past 15 or 20 years
has benefited so much from anniversary exposure. The Greek Passion does not
exactly play itself onto the stage, but it has the simple advantage of
sincerity and conviction, qualities amply reflected in this staging. It also
has just about the most bizarre stylistic mix of any modern opera -
bitonality and polyphony, warm lyrical colours juxtaposed with harsh-toned
declamation, and a rambling, tumultuous palette of instrumental and choral
voices, unpredictably interspersed with solo accordion, piano and church
bells. Judging by reactions to last year's concert performance at the
Edinburgh Festival, the work needs the stage to make dramatic sense of these
incongruities.
Rene Terrasson's touring production, conducted with a sure, confident touch
by Robert Satanowski, was built on a versatile platform of sun-blenched
steps and rocks, designed by Isabel Echarri and Diego Etcheverry. The
costumes evoked a contemporary Greek atmosphere, while the ragged appearance
of the refugee intruders could not help but bring to mind the current plight
of the Kurds and the moral dilemmas they have provoked. And that is surely
one of Martinu's prime purposes in this village drama-cum-Easter oratorio:
to ask timeless, universal questions about public and personal morality,
probing the gap between our earthly and spiritual selves.
Tibere Raffalli, as the shepherd Manolios who pays for his goodness with his
life, sang with dignity and a warm Mediterranean timbre. Jean-Marie Fremeau,
a commanding figure with an equally commanding bass-baritone voice, made a
convincing Grigoris, the hypocritical village priest. Chantal Dubarry was a
wholly sympathetic Katerina, and Remy Corazza acted the part of the pedlar
Yannakos with appealing simplicity. The chorus sounded unexpectedly
well-schooled, and Michel Ancey's French translation sang easily. The only
quirk of the evening was a brief spoken introduction and epilogue on tape,
which - far from detracting from Martinu's original - further illuminated
its meaning.

That bugbear of mankind, religious doctrine, is rearing its ugly head again
in India, a country where competing fantasies about the supernatural have
proved just as murderously dangerous as in Ireland or the Middle East.
Voting in the Indian elections begins next week and the anti-Moslem BJP is
expected to make the biggest gains. It wants to turn India into a Hindu
rather than a secular state and the country's 160 million Moslems are
alarmed. Brian Barron reports for Assignment (7.45 BBC2).
As with postage stamps and the industrial revolution, England led the rest
of Europe when it came to replacing the divine right of kings with socialist
ideals: the Diggers and Levellers of the mid 17th century would have had
little to learn from Lenin or the French egalitarians. The fourth of C4's
Civil War series concentrates on the radical ideas of the period. A new six
part drama series with Brenda Blethyn is a pleasant thought. In All Good
Things (9.30) she plays a mother with two teenage sons whose life changes
with the arrival of an unplanned baby. That is followed (10.20) by a profile
of the Romanian dictator, Ceausescu - Behind The Myth, from journalist
Edward Behr.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Arts: The Black Rider - Berlin Theatre Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To kill your wife in a shooting accident is one thing; to turn the episode
into a musical would seem, gall aside, to invite theatrical fiasco in the
worst of taste. Add lyrics that slide between German and English, a set that
crosses von Sternberg with a western, rock music with fairground honky-tonk,
and disaster looks assured.
So it is with reluctant but moonstruck admiration that I report The Black
Rider (text: William Burroughs) as the star of the Berlin Theatre Festival
(to May 20) and one of the most delightful, inventive, profound and
originally musical musicals composed; a fitting - self-consciously so -
successor to those other mythical English-German concoctions, The Threepenny
Opera and Cabaret.
The Black Rider overlays the modern legend of Burroughs, the Beatnik junkie
who shot his wife, with the old tale of the village clerk who has to pass
muster as marksman before he can marry the gamekeeper's daughter. He makes a
pact in 'silver bullets' with the devil but on his wedding day Satan betrays
him and he shoots dead not the targetted white dove but his wife. This was
the story, converted to a happy ending, of Weber's Der Freischutz. Now
Burroughs, the Texan director and stage designer Robert Wilson, and rock
composer Tom Waits, have reworked the original into a contemporary version.
Other myths get woven in. Wilson's devil is a sleek Master of ceremonies in
whiplash tails who croons the Cabaret welcome 'So come on in/it ain't no
sin/take off your skin/and dance around in your bones'. He introduces the
cast, his 'devil's band', as they step one by one out of a black felt
sentry-box.
For three hours of graceful, cold artifice, they look, act and sound like
figures from the silent movies: movements abrupt, irregular, too fast, too
slow, as if wound up by a shaky hand projector; chalk-white, bony faces,
blackened eye sockets, lips thickened into permanent red pouts. Every image
is ice-hard: hair pulled back crisp or standing up in spikes, clothes
exagerating bodies with jagged collars, razor pleats, square and rectangular
dresses.
The set continues the theme; Wilson turns children's drawings into
three-dimensional monstrosities. Crooked chairs, two metres high, dangle at
odd angles along with a huge frame whose broken glass juts into the flesh of
its 'living' picture, the gamekeeper's ancestor (Heinz Fossbrink). Pine
trees are scissor cut-outs which collapse and grow again like cartoons,
illuminated sugar pink and lime green against a black forest. Large or small
scale, Wilson is a master of spectacle: the clerk William and his Katchen
floating above the stage for a duet as the great neon sign of a gun descends
before them; the white stockinged leg in red stiletto that appears out of a
slit in the black sentrybox, image of naivety, severity, brittle romance.
Best of all, the whole, the sustained dramatic unity of the vision, is
greater than the sum of its parts. Tom Waits' sarcastic ballads, full of
folk and blues and rock, call back the scarred idealism and mock simplicity
of Kurt Weill, while Burroughs' monosyllabic banality has here found the
setting which makes it seem perfect.
Nursery rhyme humour marries English with German, while Hollywood kitsch
rolls into Teutonic romanticism. Wilson's cast bop and strut and beat out
the mesmeric rhythms in husky tempting voices. The devil (Dominique Horwitz)
has the best tunes, and mocks us for loving them. In 'Last Rose of Summer'
he picks a flower from the floor, affects a tear, disappears into his box
and, inside it, hovers up to the roof of the stage.
Annette Paulmann and Stefan Kurt, as Katchen and William, screech like
vultures and sing like angels. She plays an imaginary piano and draws
patterns in the air as she sings the breathless lyric 'I'll shoot the moon
right out of the sky for you, baby'; he dances a ballet of despair, shock
and loss breaking through his wax face, before rallying with 'I'll be back
on some lucky day'. This production returns to Hamburg's Thalia Theatre
after Berlin, with a stop in Amsterdam on May 14-16. So far plans for a
London visit have not materialised, but this is a show worth a plane ticket.

The wrong price on an invoice is the most common cause of delayed payments,
according to a survey of 400 companies carried out by Resource Evaluation
(REL), a specialist consultancy. Incorrect pricing accounted for 30 per cent
of delayed payments by value.
The other main reasons for delayed payments - some of which are used
deliberately by customers to conserve their own cash flow - were requests
for copies of documents (16 per cent by value); administrative errors (15
per cent); requests for proof of delivery (14 per cent) and shortages of the
items required (6 per cent).
Companies make insufficient use of measurement techniques to assess how good
they are at collecting their money, REL says.
At least one company surveyed produced one credit note for every seven
invoices, a figure which indicated that it had to replace or rework a
significant amount of goods supplied and that it was probably already in
serious trouble.
REL surveyed companies with outstanding sales ledger balances of between
Pounds 2m and Pounds 302m. The average outstanding sum owed to the companies
surveyed was Pounds 14.6m, of which on average 35 per cent was subject to
dispute. The cost to the supplier of providing this amount of unauthorised
credit would be about Pounds 2,000 a day. This does not include the cost of
investigating and correcting errors. The administrative cost of issuing a
credit note is at least Pounds 25.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Management: Self-help takes off from the flat-lands - The
application of community bonds in Saskatchewan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Any effort to lure new industry to rural Saskatchewan runs the risk of
ending up as more of a repellent than a magnet.
Far away from North America's main markets, the farming towns which dot the
Canadian prairies are best known for their pancake-flat scenery and numbing
winters.
But in their quest for diversification, these remote communities have hit on
a novel way to tempt small and mid-sized businesses into setting up or
expanding on their doorstep.
Their bargaining chip is a scheme of government-sponsored 'community bonds'.
Launched last year, the bonds are designed to mobilise equity for local
enterprises, using the sizeable amounts of money which frugal prairie
townsfolk and farmers have up to now squirrelled away in low-risk bank
deposits and blue-chip shares.
Several businesses have already taken the bait. Trinitral International, a
small maker of telephone sets, expects to open a 17-person assembly and
packaging facility next month in the south-east Saskatchewan town of
Melville (population 5,000).
Melville's Community Bond Corporation raised CDollars 250,000 from local
residents late last year, giving it a 25 per cent stake in Trinitral. Other
shareholders are a provincial government agency, the company's managers and
Dorart Industries, a Singapore company which will supply kits and know-how
to Trinitral.
In the town of Kindersley, near the Saskatchewan-Alberta border, a newly
formed community bond corporation hopes to rake in CDollars 500,000 over the
next month or two. The money will be invested in Rotary Airforce, which is
developing a slow-moving type of helicopter suitable for crowd control and
pipeline inspections.
Rotary's existing R&amp;D operation is currently occupying aircraft hangars near
Edmonton, in neighbouring Alberta. The infusion of equity from community
bonds has led the company to set up its manufacturing facility in
Kindersley.
Over 60 towns have registered community bond corporations in the past year.
Three financings have been completed, while ten other bond offerings are
currently under way. Other project companies include a maker of combine
harvester attachments and a pea-chip processing plant.
Some communities plan to use the corporations like mutual funds, first
raising money and then searching for one or more businesses which they would
like to have in town.
The key to the scheme is a guarantee provided by the provincial government
on the principal amount of the bonds. In other words, local investors stand
to lose no more than the interest, dividends or capital gains which might
have accrued elsewhere.
Even with this safeguard, however, the community bond scheme is fraught with
risks. At least some of the businesses will almost certainly fail, which
could leave the government with sizeable financial obligations, and local
communities with the political and economic scars of a serious misadventure.
Some community bond corporations, designed as vehicles for 'people's
capitalism', may have difficulty functioning as sophisticated shareholders.
Many of the directors are neophytes in economic development. The 12-member
Kindersley corporation, for instance, includes a local dentist and a farmer.
Each board must also appoint a 'youth director' under the age of 18.
There is a nagging suspicion in some quarters that the provincial
government, facing an election later this year, has launched the scheme with
an eye on popular appeal rather than sound commercial practice. One observer
notes that 'there is quite a lot of nervousness among those close to the
process, compared with the euphoria of the politicians who are touting it'.
Despite these potential stumbling blocks, Dale Botting, regional manager for
the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, thinks the scheme is worth
a try. He expects that the government's total liability to holders of
community bonds will turn out to be far lower than the millions of dollars
which it has poured into extravagant projects over the years.
'The real value of this may be to shore up the equity of businesses already
in the community and to encourage an entrepreneurial culture,' Botting says.
For instance, Trinitral was able to get sufficient bank financing for its
telephone set business only after it came up with the extra equity provided
by community bonds.
Among other spin-offs, residents who volunteer to sell community bonds
receive a short training course in the basics of investing in a small
business. Students at the Saskatch-ewan College of Commerce can obtain
course credits by helping with administrative work in the corporations.
Rick Dillabaugh, Kindersley's economic development officer, acknowledges
that many of the bond-financed ventures will fail. But he contends that 'if
you don't go out and try, you won't get the good ones either. This puts the
destiny of the community into its own hands. They can choose what direction
they want to take.'
The proceeds of bond sales are normally invested in a company's preferred
shares, convertible into common stock after three to five years. In that
way, holders can benefit from increased dividends and capital gains, if
there are any. Bond corporations have a right to nominate directors to the
boards of project companies proportionate to their equity stakes.
The province is well aware of the risk that the scheme could degenerate into
a gravy train for dubious ventures. Community bond corporations are
encouraged to hire a reputable accountant or lawyer to help them sift
through project proposals. Every investment must also be approved by a
six-member provincial review committee, comprising two business lawyers, a
former head of the provincial finance department, and three economic
development experts.
Graham Parsons, a government economist who claims credit for devising the
scheme and is now in charge of implementing it, reckons that the best
safeguard is the board of directors of the bond corporations themselves.
'These people will be in the community for the next 10-20 years,' Parsons
says. 'They have a significant responsibility to be fair and reasonable to
others in the community.'

FT  14 MAY 91 / Management: Controversy over Canada's loans policy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Canada is searching for ways to breathe vigour into a popular federal
loan-guarantee programme for budding entrepreneurs which makes use of the
extensive resources of the country's financial institutions.
Over CDollars 7.7bn has been disbursed to about 285,000 businesses since the
inception of the Small Business Loans Act (SBLA) programme 30 years ago. In
the year to March 1990, 13,800 loans were made with a value of CDollars
539m.
(The British government, meanwhile, has commissioned a review of the UK's
equivalent Loan Guarantee Scheme. This programme, which provides a 70 per
cent guarantee, has backed 27,900 loans worth Pounds 890m since 1981.)
The SBLA's greatest strength, but one which is also turning out to be a
serious weakness, is the role of financial institutions in administering the
scheme. The loans are advanced by banks, trust companies and credit unions -
institutions that have branch networks and credit assessment skills which
the government could not hope to match.
Ottawa's role is to provide a guarantee on up to 85 per cent of the loan,
with the financial institution taking the risk on the remaining 15 per cent.
All loans must be secured, either by business or personal assets.
The loans can be used to finance up to 90 per cent of land and premises
costs, and 80 per cent of equipment costs, up to a CDollars 100,000 limit.
Only companies with annual sales of less than CDollars 2m are eligible.
Banks are obliged to charge an interest rate equal to one percentage point
over bank prime rate, currently at 10 per cent in Canada. This compares with
a typical rate for commercial loans of two or three points above prime.
The scheme appears to have made a sizeable contribution in spawning new
enterprises. Almost 40 per cent of the SBLA loans made last year were for
start-ups, while 60 per cent were for businesses less than three years old.
A study commissioned by the Canadian Bankers Association says that about 15
per cent of small-business loans are covered by an SBLA guarantee.
But the volume of loans has slowed markedly in the past few years. Last
year's total number of 13,800 was 22 per cent down on 1989. One reason is
the recession. But the banks, more concerned than ever with their lending
margins, also object to being forced to make loans at the set rate of prime
plus 1 per cent.
The banks have come to see SBLA loans as something of a loss leader; they
consider the chief benefit to be the other business they may generate from
the borrowing company, its owners or its employees.
Michael Hanly, director of small business loans in the Department of
Industry, Science and Technology, says that banks are increasingly taking
loans onto their own books which might in the past have been channelled
through the SBLA. 'We've got to make it more attractive for the banks,' he
says.
Among the changes now under consideration are a more flexible interest-rate
structure (including perhaps, a service fee for the banks), and a higher
loan ceiling.
The 88,000-member Canadian Federation for Independent Business is pressing
for other adjustments, too. It suggests that the guarantee and interest-rate
formula could be tailored for specific groups of entrepreneurs, such as
women or disadvantaged minority groups.
In return for market-related interest charges, the CFIB wants the banks to
cut back their personal security requirements. 'Our experience is that, even
on conventional loans, the banks over-demand on collateral,' says Brian
Gray, the CFIB's senior vice-president. The chances of the banks agreeing to
that however, are small.

FT  14 MAY 91 / FT Law Report: Japanese formulae do not disclose patent
method
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RE ASAHI KASEI KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA House of Lords (Lord Keith of Kinkel,
Lord Brandon of Oakbrook, Lord Ackner, Lord Oliver of Aylmerton and Lord
Jauncey of Tullichettle): May 9 1991
A GENETIC engineering patent claim is not deprived of novelty at its
priority date by an earlier application on another patent published before
or after that date disclosing the formulae by which the relevant chemical
compounds are created, if the earlier application makes no enabling
disclosure in that it fails to disclose the method by which the formulae are
to be applied in producing the compounds.
The House of Lords so held when allowing an appeal by Asahi Kasei Kogyo
Kabushiki Kaisha, from a Court of Appeal decision upholding a determination
of the comptroller of patents that a patent application by Asahi lacked
novelty at its priority date.
Section 2 of the Patents Act 1977 provides: '(1) An invention shall be taken
to be new if it does not form part of the state of the art.
(2) The state of the art in the case of an invention shall be taken to
comprise all matter . . . which has at any time before the priority date of
that invention been made available to the public.
(3) The state of the art in the case of an invention . . . shall be taken
also to comprise matter contained in an application for another patent which
was published on or after the priority date of that invention, if . . . (a)
that matter was contained in the application for that other patent . . . and
(b) the priority date of that matter is earlier than that of the invention'.
LORD OLIVER said that the appeal arose from competing applications for
patents for chemical inventions in the field of genetic engineering.
A Japanese company, Dainippon, filed application JP 617 in Japan on March 6
1984. On April 6 1984 Asahi filed an application in the US. On February 26
1985 Dainippon filed application EP 549 in the European Patents Office
claiming priority from JP 617. Asahi filed UK 864 on April 4 1985 claiming
priority from the US application of April 6 1984. For the purposes of the
appeal it was assumed that the subject matter of claims 2 and 3 of UK 864
was matter disclosed in EP 549, and that EP 549 adequately described a
method of preparing the products of those claims.
It was also assumed that the earliest EP 549 priority document (ie, JP 617)
disclosed the products of claims 2 and 3 of UK 864, but did not describe any
preparation methods.
The question, on those assumptions, was whether, having regard to the JP 617
disclosure, the subject matter of claims 2 and 3 of UK 864 formed part of
the state of the art under section 2 of the Patents Act 1977 at the UK 864
priority date, so as to deprive those claims of novelty.
The question arose between Asahi and the comptroller of patents on
examination of the application in suit, the UK 864 application.
On February 16 1988 the superintending examiner determined that EP 549
formed part of the state of the art at the UK 864 priority date and thus
anticipated claims 2 and 3.
EP 549 was not published until September 1985, after the UK 864 priority
date, so the examiner's decision was based on section 2(3) of the act and JP
617 priority.
Asahi argued that for disclosure in an application to form part of the state
of the art under section 2(3), it had to disclose the method of working the
invention, ie, it had to be an 'enabling disclosure'. It said mere
disclosure of a formula for a compound claimed was not sufficient.
That argument was rejected by the superintending examiner. Mr Justice
Falconer dismissed Asahi's appeal. The Court of Appeal upheld that
dismissal. Asahi now appealed.
The first question was, what material in EP 549 was entitled to the priority
date of JP 617? The second question was whether that material anticipated
the claims of the application in suit, having regard to the provisions of
section 2.
Section 5(2)(a) of the act provided that if an invention to which an
application related was 'supported by matter disclosed' in an earlier
application, the invention priority date should be the date of filing the
earlier application. By section 5(2)(b) the priority date of 'any matter
contained in the application in suit' was to be the date of filing the
earlier application in which 'that matter was disclosed'.
The act did not contain any definition of 'supported', but some assistance
could be obtained from section 14(5) which required the claim in an
application to be 'supported' by the description.
That must involve the conclusion that if the specification description did
not enable the claim to be established, it could not be said to 'support'
it, for the act could hardly have contemplated a complete application for a
patent lacking some of the material necessary to sustain the claims made.
It followed that a description in an earlier application which contained no
enabling disclosure would not 'support' the invention so as to enable it to
claim priority from the date of that application under section 5(2)(a),
although the description would be entitled to a priority as 'matter
contained' in the application in suit under section 5(2)(b).
What was claimed was a chemical compound formula produced in accordance
with, and identified by reference to, the formula disclosed.
The invention was not the formula itself but the thing identified and
described in terms of chemical building blocks by reference to the formula
of its compositions.
There might of course be cases where the means of producing the thing would
be self-evident to the man skilled in the art from the mere recital of the
formula or its composition, but it was not suggested that this was such a
case.
It had, therefore, to be assumed for present purposes that the man skilled
in the art, if he was to produce the invention claimed, would need to know,
not simply the formula, but a method by which it could be produced in
accordance with that formula. The invention, as a patentable concept,
involved the combination of formula and means.
It followed, Asahi argued, that EP 549 could not claim under section 5(2)(a)
priority from JP 617 for the totality of the invention claimed, but it could
claim priority from that application under section 5(2)(b) for the formulae
disclosed. So far as the means of making the invention was concerned, it
could claim priority only from the date of its own filing under section
5(1).
The logic of that argument seemed unassailable.
None of the relevant material had at priority date been published. The
critical provision was section 2(3).
In Genentech (1989) RPC 613 Mr Justice Falconer concluded that to constitute
anticipation to a claim to a new chemical compound, disclosure in a prior
document must be an enabling disclosure. In reaching that conclusion he
necessarily disapproved a contrary decision in GKI (1958) RPC 51.
For an anticipation under section 2(2) Genentech was to be preferred to GKI.
Asahi contended that the test was the same for section 2(3).
Section 2(3) deemed to be part of the state of the art nothing more than
matter entitled to priority under section 5.
Thus, the formula disclosed in JP 617 was deemed to be part of the state of
the art, but it did not follow that the invention claimed in that
application, ie, the compound produced by application of the formula, was
part of the state of the art so as to anticipate the claims made in UK 864.
The only 'matter' disclosed was the bare claim that a compound could be
prepared of the specified composition.
The appeal was allowed. The application was remitted to the Patent Office.
Their lordships agreed. Lord Jauncey gave a concurring judgment.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Technology (Technically Speaking):  Gallium arsenide comes
of age
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The soul of Convex Computer's new family of supercomputers is made of
gallium arsenide (GaAs), a semiconductor compound touted as a successor to
silicon as the building material for future generations of computer chips.
Since the late 1960s semiconductor experts have debated the merits of
gallium arsenide. In theory, the material offers inherent speed and power
advantages. GaAs transistors are faster and consume less power than silicon
transistors.
Making GaAs chips has, however, proven to be far more difficult and
expensive than expected. Only a handful of the two dozen or so start-up chip
companies created in the early 1980s to exploit GaAs technology have
survived. Just last week, three of the most promising US GaAs chip makers
agreed to merge.
For Gazelle Microcircuits, Gigabit Logic and Triquint Semiconductor, the
merger represents an opportunity to form an economically viable unit
combining the best of three attempts to exploit GaAs chip technology.
Currently, GaAs devices are used primarily in military applications, where
their high speed and tolerance of high temperatures is valuable, as well as
in high-frequency communications systems.
In the far bigger market for computer chips, however, silicon reigns
supreme. The worldwide market for GaAs chips was about Dollars 260m last
year, up from Dollars 200m in 1989, according to Integrated Circuit
Engineering, a US market research firm.
Nevertheless, Convex's adoption of GaAs has provided proponents with new
hope that the technology will become pervasive.
Also spurring new interest is the need for high-speed peripheral chips to
keep up with ever-faster silicon microprocessors that are used to power PCs
and workstations.
ICE projects that the GaAs chip market will grow at an annual rate of 36 per
cent to reach Dollars 1.2bn by 1995. Today, military, aerospace and
telecommunications applications account for almost 80 per cent of GaAs chip
sales, but by the middle of the decade computer applications will be close
to half of the GaAs chip market, the market researchers predict.
If GaAs does become a commercial success then it will be in part due to the
dogged support provided by the US Defence Department. The Pentagon has been
a major source of funding for GaAs semiconductor research and development
over the past few years.
Three years ago the Defence Advance Research Projects Agency (Darpa) began
funding a research programme called Mimic (Microwave and Millimetre Wave
Monolithic Integrated Circuits) to spur development of GaAs devices for
military uses.
In a controversial move, Darpa last year provided Dollars 4m in research and
development funds to Gazelle Microcircuits, to stave off sale of the
company's technology to a foreign investor.
Established semiconductor companies, several of which participated in the
Mimic programme, are now expanding their production of GaAs devices in
anticipation of a broader market. Motorola recently announced plans to build
a Dollars 100m GaAs chip plant in Arizona, scheduled to begin production
next year of chips for commercial and military applications.
The prospects for GaAs microprocessors and memory chips remain uncertain and
the chances are that silicon will remain the pervasive semiconductor
material for these devices.
None the less, Convex's decision to 'go GaAs' marks the entry of this
technology into the 'mainstream' of the chip market. After decades of
promises, GaAs looks like a technology whose time has finally come.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Technology: Kodak's digital double
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A photocopier used to be just a photocopier: but not for much longer.
The industry's largest manufacturers are about to reveal machines which act
as computer printers, scanners and even facsimile machines, as well as
perform the traditional role of copying sheets of text. The move is based on
the concept that whether you print, scan or photocopy, you are simply
replicating a series of little black squiggles between paper and computer.
Leading the field are US-parented companies such as Xerox and Kodak. Today
Kodak, which specialises in large photocopiers, will launch a copier which
replicates images digitally, rather than optically. This, the company
believes, will form the base technology around which a variety of office
applications can be built.
'At the moment we are using the machine just to copy,' says Mike Mansell,
manager of commercial and information marketing for Kodak and head of its
copy products division. 'But the interesting thing is what we do in the
future.'
Because the machine scans the document and digitises the information before
printing out the text and pictures, that digital information could, in
future, be sent over the phone.
This could lead, Mansell believes, to large photocopiers being used for an
even wider variety of tasks. While most of the bigger machines are used
today for large print runs, in future they could handle a mixture of jobs.
Further ahead they could be used in conjunction with personal computers for
manipulating text and images within a document - a computer graphic, a photo
and a piece of text could be incorporated in the same document.
Eventually Mansell envisages a situation where the Kodak machine launched
today, called the 1570, forms the hub of a company's reprographics
facilities. From there it could instruct local printer/copier units, in
different places around the country, or the world, to print documents.

<TEXT>
SIR LEON Brittan, the senior UK commissioner, yesterday urged the UK
government to drop its proposal for a 'hard Ecu' in favour of improving the
existing Ecu basket unit.
He did not link this with the overture by Mr Jacques Delors that Britain be
offered a let-out in the emu treaty.
The hard Ecu had proved 'politically valuable', Sir Leon said, showing that
the UK government was taking part in the Emu debate constructively. But, for
economic reasons, it had drawn little support from UK partners.
Sir Leon derided Britons who regarded the let-out on Emu as a trap or a form
of blackmail. There was no underhand deceit in the proposal, nor could be it
be considered blackmail for Britain's partners to try to make Emu such a
success that the UK would feel impelled to join.

INDUSTRY training organ-isations (ITOs), recognised by governments as the
voice of training for particular industries, were yesterday urged to act
with companies in their sectors to promote more effective training.
Mr Robert Jackson, a junior employment minister, made the appeal in his
endorsement of an action plan which was the result of a study of 10 ITOs by
Manpower Research on behalf of the Department of Employment and the National
Council of Industry Training Organisations.
The study showed how ITOs could improve their effectiveness, particularly
through links with employers. It also said ITOs should set out their roles;
identify their sectors' changing skill needs; and demonstrate that 'training
pays'.
The study was part of a wider review of ITOs, the results of which will be
available in mid-1991. There are more than 100 ITOs, varying in size,
resources, membership and activity.

FT  14 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): TGWU drives for equal pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT TOOK 18 years and two strikes for a group of female sewing machinists at
Ford to win what they saw as a battle for equal pay with male workers. A
further seven years of battling by other female workers has failed to
eradicate what unions see as widespread sex discrimination on pay in the
motor industry.
Yesterday the TGWU general workers' union, the biggest union in car
manufacturing, launched an equal-pay drive which it said could lead to rises
of up to Pounds 1,000 for some of its 4,000 female workers in the motor
industry.
The union is backing equal-value claims for 380 women sewing machinists at
Jaguar, Vauxhall and Aston Martin. Ms Margaret Prosser, TGWU national
women's officer, said the union was actively seeking out equal-value claims
on behalf of other groups of undervalued women car workers.
She added that the average weekly pay of women in the motor industry was
Pounds 207, about 78 per cent of the rate for men. Wherever possible, the
union would try to win rises for women through job evaluation and
grade-structure reorganisations.
The dispute at Ford began in 1966 when a job evaluation scheme left sewing
machinists, mainly female, on less pay than pattern cutters, most of whom
were men. A strike that year and subsequent tribunal decisions failed to win
them higher pay. The women finally won rises in 1985 after another strike
and the setting up of an independent tribunal. Ford, however, saw it as a
grading dispute, rather than one over equal pay.
Earlier this year an independent expert was asked by a tribunal to
investigate the case of sewing machinists at Vauxhall. The claimants are
being backed by the AEU engineering union.

FT  14 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Few union deals at new plants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIONS appear to have found it increasingly difficult in the past three
years to gain recognition agreements from inward investors and British
companies setting up new plants, a senior TUC official said yesterday.
Mr John Monks, TUC deputy general secretary, said only 10 deals had been
notified to the TUC since October 1988 under a procedure to regulate
inter-union conflict of the kind which led to the expulsion of the EETPU
electricians' union.
Under the prior-notification procedure, which was made permanent in June
last year after an extended trial period, unions should tell the TUC about
any single-union deal they are about to sign.
Mr Monks told a conference in London that the number of deals was 'very
small' compared with the rush of agreements signed in the mid-1980s.
This led to conflict when unions competed in 'beauty contests' for
recognition.
He said that was one reason why TUC unions supported the idea of a statutory
recognition procedure under a Labour government.
That would allow a 'step-by-step' approach to rights depending on union
membership.
Mr Monks said the TUC might switch support to establishing the size of union
membership in a company by a workforce ballot rather than by a petition
drawn up by a union.
He said that it might be 'politically advisable' to assess membership size
through a ballot in order to gain public support for the TUC's proposals.
Mr Monks said the prior-notification procedure had worked well. The final
proposals are to be approved by the TUC general council in June.

A CASH squeeze at WSK Mielec, one of Poland's biggest aircraft factories,
and one of 200 Polish plants dependent on sales to the Soviet Union, means
14,500 workers may not be paid their April wages due today, Christopher
Bobinski reports from Warsaw.
Polish officials were in Moscow yesterday for talks on finding ways of
securing payments. Poland meanwhile is paying for its purchases of Soviet
oil and gas.
The factory has in effect ceased to pay for deliveries of components from
domestic producers since Comecon countries switched to hard currency pricing
on January 1. Management has said it will no longer take delivery of them.
WSK Mielec makes AN 28 and AN 2 aircraft for the Soviet market. Last year,
it laid off 4,800 workers.

investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEGISLATION introduced in the US House of Representatives yesterday would
require an executive block on foreign investment if it threatens to harm the
US economy.
US law partly requires the administration to block investment only if it
imperils the US national security interest. Forces in Congress are insisting
on expanding the definition of national security to include economic, not
just military, interests.
The bill sponsored by Mr Mel Levine, a California Democrat, and Mr Frank
Wolf, a Virginia Republican, reflects concern about US high-technology
companies being sold to foreign interests.
It would force the administration to include new factors before approving
sales. These involve the concentration of foreign direct investment in the
industry in question, the effect on critical technologies, and whether the
firm to be acquired has received US government funds.
The Congressmen released a report criticising the Committee on Foreign
Investment in the US (CFIUS), the inter-agency committee which vets foreign
investments. The study, by the Economic Strategy Institute, says CFIUS
reviewed only 12 of 400 critical foreign acquisitions in the past
two-and-a-half years, including 95 computer companies, 35 semiconductor
groups, 30 semiconductor equipment-makers, and 15 aerospace companies.
The legislation's backers hope to use experiences in the Gulf war to attract
support. One of the Congressmen said: 'In the Gulf conflict, without
Japanese parts for their radars, our F-16 pilots couldn't find their
targets. Imports of Japanese machine-tools have become so crucial that the
M1 Abrams Tank could not be built without them'.
The proposed legislation would transfer control of CFIUS from the US
Treasury to the commerce department. The Congressmen claimed a conflict of
interests in the Treasury's dual mission of encouraging foreign purchases of
Treasury bills and filtering out acquisitions that could harm US national
security.

Mr Percival Patterson, finance minister, said the growth was achieved
despite 'adverse external shocks'. The island's economy grew 4.6 per cent in
1989. He said the agriculture sector expanded by 11.8 per cent in 1990, with
mining up 17.6 per cent and manufacturing up 4.1 per cent.
The island's trading position improved; the Dollars 724m (Pounds 420)
merchandise trade deficit was Dollars 98m less than the year-earlier
shortfall. Imports grew 1.7 per cent and exports 14.2 per cent.
Mr Patterson said public debt was Dollars 4.15bn at the end of 1990, Dollars
114m less than a year earlier.

FT  14 MAY 91 / World Trade News: ECGD pressed to boost export cover for
Iran
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN's Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) is facing mounting
pressure from industry to restore medium-term cover on export credits to
Iran, following the liberation of Kuwait and the release of Mr Roger Cooper,
the businessman held hostage in Tehran for more than five years.
Businessmen say they are concerned that without fresh cover, the UK could
lose market share in Iran to other industrial countries such as France,
Germany and Italy whose exports have been growing much faster than those of
the UK as Tehran opened up to the west. Italy has, for example, agreed to
provide Iran with Dollars 1bn (Pounds 592m) in credits for building two
power stations and other industrial projects, the Iranian News Agency IRNA
reported last week.
Even Japan, which made large losses on loans to Iraq originally extended
during the boom years of the 1970s, is now considering resuming the issue of
medium-term credit guarantees. The trading house Nissho Iwai has applied for
cover from Tokyo's Ministry of International Trade and Industry for its
share in a Dollars 450m petrochemical plant ordered earlier this year from a
consortium led by Technip of France.
ECGD, which has been under fire for its restrictive attitude on
developing-country risk, would say yesterday only that the question of cover
for Iran was 'under review'. An official could not say how long the review
would take.
Businessmen think the UK is reluctant to offer fresh cover for Iran until
British citizens held hostage in Lebanon are freed. Despite the UK embassy
re-opening in Tehran, this problem is thought to have delayed exchange of
ambassadors. On a separate issue, ECGD yesterday denied reports it was
insisting all short-term credit insurance to Kuwait be backed by irrevocable
letters of credit.
It said it had done some business on open account since liberation. This did
not involve irrevocable letters of credit, but overall volume of business
remains small, with sales treated case-by-case. Businessmen said it would be
normal for ECGD to require irrevocable letters of credit on most business
where the Kuwaiti importer was a private-sector company. It was to be
expected some importers would find it hard to establish letters of credit,
as the records of local bankers might have been lost during the Iraqi
occupation.

FT  14 MAY 91 / World Trade News: Estonia tightens rules for Moscow trade /
Examine the new bureaucratic problems of Baltic commerce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ENRIQUE TESSIERI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BACK IN the centrally planned days when Moscow had enough muscle and
merchandise, it dictated all terms of trade with its compliant Soviet
republics.
Local companies got their orders from their ministries, which in turn
received strict guidelines from Gosplan, the state planning ministry, on
where, how much and the value of the merchandise they were going to trade.
But now some republics, such as Estonia, are trying to break out from under
the constraining wings of Moscow. Estonia is attempting to exercise its own
control through the use of a licensing bureau monitoring which, and at what
level, exports can leave its economic border.
Other republics and smaller-scale districts are following the same pattern,
such that one Bank of Estonia official described the USSR as being engulfed
internally by a vast and complex amount of trade barriers: 'The USSR is
becoming a country made up of many Albanias.'
Estonia's year-old Licence Department, backed by the muscle of its customs
officials, is an attempt to eliminate the danger of chronic shortages of
commodities, as well as an expression of its desire to mark out greater
political and economic autonomy from Moscow.
Shortages of basic goods in Estonia have arisen, thanks to extreme
differences in relative prices between the different republics of the Soviet
Union. Thus it has become a profitable trade to buy in bulk from one
republic at a relatively cheap price, and sell dear in a neighbouring
republic.
Items in greatest demand from Estonia include meat, sweets and other
foodstuffs. In Latvia it is electronic equipment and vans, while in
Lithuania it is refrigerators and television sets, according to Mr Rein
Voog, an official with the Bank of Estonia.
'A person can become rich very fast if he trades in the USSR. For example,
if you can buy meat in Estonia and take it to Leningrad you can make a lot
of money since meat in Leningrad is twice as expensive. This is why
(Estonia) must keep a certain degree of control over what leaves the
country,' said Mr Voog.
To make sure no-one empties a market at the - by western and black-market
standards - ridiculously low regulated prices, republics like Estonia have
issued their inhabitants with a purchasing card. A Latvian cannot, for
example, buy meat at an Estonian market.
Mr Voog admits that trade with the west is much easier than within the
Soviet Union, since the rules are clear and simple to follow. Estimpex,
which has lost its monopoly as the sole Estonian export organisation, still
functions.
The Bank of Estonia official felt that for some companies it may be easier
to do business with Estimpex, which is known in some business circles in the
west. It may also be easier to get an export licence through Estimpex. Since
Gosplan has been undermined by the unstable economic situation in the USSR
and by inefficient price controls, Soviet republics such as Estonia have
established barter committees, state-run bodies, to carry out trade with
other republics. The export quotas of the Estonian barter committee are
regulated by the Licence Department.
Mr Mati Jurgens, general-director of the Estonian Licence Department, says
it granted 1,700 export licences last year, and will double that in 1991.
Most of the licences are for furniture and building materials. About 60 per
cent went to Russia, the rest to the Ukraine, Latvia and Lithuania.
Each barter deal between the Estonian and other Soviet republic barter
committees is done on a case-by-case basis. There are no standard ratios or
values which the Estonian barter committee uses or agreements on which value
a certain commodity will have. These factors are determined by forces of
'demand' and 'what is in great shortage', according to Mr Jurgens. If a
company's export papers are in order, getting an export licence should take
no longer than 15 days.
'A recent barter deal we approved with Russia involved an Estonian furniture
company, which purchased the steel to build the chairs. These chairs were
sold back to Russia for 70 roubles a piece,' explained Mr Jurgens.
Other examples of trade can involve cash roubles. An Estonian state,
collective or co-operative farm may need to buy a tractor. According to Mr
Jurgens, the seller of the tractor may ask as much as 30,000 roubles for
such a vehicle or two tons of meat in payment.
Arguing over the price of the meat, they may agree on 10 roubles a kilo,
which would add up to 20,000 roubles' worth of meat. The remaining 10,000
roubles could be paid in cash.
Mr Jurgens says there are still staffing problems in effectively controlling
Estonia's economic borders. A great deal of merchandise is getting out
without official permission; the Estonian-Latvian customs checkpoint at the
small town of Moisakula has one local policeman on patrol, who has
permission to use a revolver. One can cross the Estonian-Latvian border on
the smaller roads without being stopped by any customs officials.

<TEXT>
VENEZUELA'S most important organised labour group, the Confederation of
Venezuelan Workers (CTV), has attacked a government decree ordering a 15 per
cent wage rise. It warned of 'grave consequences' if the decree was
implemented.
In a public letter to President Carlos Andres Perez at the weekend, the CTV
expressed its 'deep disgust and rejection' of the administration's decree.
Earlier this year the group demanded a 45 per cent nationwide wage increase,
which was rejected by the government as inflationary. But last week the
administration decreed a 15 per cent wage rise for private-sector employees
not covered by collective labour contracts, and ordered a 50 per cent rise
in the urban minimum wage, to Dollars 109 (Pounds 63) a month.
The CTV has strongly opposed most of the government's economic reform
programme since it was announced in early 1989. Ironically, its leadership
is dominated by members of Democratic Action, Mr Perez's own political
party.
The group's head, Mr Antonio Rios, and other officials are currently under
investigation for alleged corruption. In some sectors, labour's militant
demands for wage increases are seen as an attempt to divert attention from
the allegations.
At the same time the government has warned that if 'price speculation'
continued on basic items it would reinstate limited price controls.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Recession-hit US states consider tax increases: Spending
cuts target education and health programmes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER RIDDELL, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MORE US states are being forced to consider tax increases, across-the-board
spending cuts and staff redundancies and lay-offs as a result of shortfalls
in tax receipts caused by the recession.
The Centre for the Study of the States, a think-tank based in Albany, New
York, has calculated that tax receipts in the 50 states during the first
three months of this year averaged just 0.9 per cent higher than a year
earlier. Had many states not imposed tax increases, revenue would have
declined 1.3 per cent. In real, inflation-adjusted, terms receipts dropped 6
per cent.
In California revenue dropped 5.7 per cent in the period as a result of
lower personal, corporate and sales taxes. There were also declines in
Virginia, Ohio, Michigan, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Tennessee. Only
states which have enacted tax increases - such as New Jersey, Oklahoma,
Kentucky and Arizona - saw revenue rise appreciably.
Individual states, rather than the federal government, have to fund a wider
range of social and community services than local authorities do in Britain
and much of Europe.
For instance, the federal government finances only 6 per cent of education
spending, with the rest coming from state or local city and county taxes.
States are particularly vulnerable as they rely heavily on sales taxes,
which have been affected by sluggish consumer spending. Costs of programmes
such as health care for the poor and elderly, prisons and law and order are
rising rapidly, in some instances outstripping inflation. The cost of
Medicaid, half of which is borne by the states, rose 25 per cent last year.
Moreover, most states are legally required to balance their budgets and
cannot run deficits on their current spending. During the 1980s, thanks to
inflation and rapid growth, many states built up cash surpluses, but their
balances are down to Dollars 5.9bn (Pounds 3.4bn), or 2 per cent of total
expenditures, the lowest level since 1983.
Consequently, according to the National Governors Association, 29 states
have cut a total of more than Dollars 8bn from their budgets and 26 states
are raising taxes by a record Dollars 10.3bn for the current 1991 fiscal
year, with Dollars 6.7bn already planned for the next fiscal year.
This presents considerable political problems, in view of voters' resistance
to tax increases; their aversion was largely responsible for the defeat of
several incumbent governors in last November's elections and there are fears
that current problems could spark further taxpayer revolts.
The main spending cuts have been in mental health programmes, higher
education and, in some cases, aid to local schools. State employees have
been laid off or given days off without pay as state governments shut down
on selected days.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Australian inflation rate expected to start falling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S Labor government is likely to get a much needed boost this week
from Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures showing inflation has moved onto a
downward path.
Analysts are forecasting a rise of around 0.4 per cent in the March-quarter
CPI, due on Thursday, which would reduce the annual rate of inflation from
6.9 per cent to 5.5 per cent. This would represent a significant improvement
over the 2.7 per cent increase in the December quarter, and would put
Australia on course for annualised inflation of less than 5 per cent by the
end of the year.
It would also allow Mr Paul Keating, the treasurer (finance minister), to
claim a measure of success in controlling inflation, which has been the
government's top priority since the economy slipped into recession last
year.
However, critics say the March figures will be heavily influenced by one-off
factors, including a 15.6 per cent reduction in petrol prices and lower
mortgage interest rates.
The improved longer-term outlook is largely a result of the weakness of the
economy, which grew by only 0.6 per cent in the December quarter, following
six months of negative growth, and is expected to contract again in the
March quarter.
The government is facing political problems caused by a continuing increase
in unemployment, which reached 9.9 per cent in April and is likely to exceed
the 10.3 per cent recorded in the trough of the last recession in 1983. The
high level of unemployment has increased pressure for an early cut in
official interest rates to stimulate growth, but economists say the
government may delay until next month, unless the inflation figures are
unexpectedly good.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Indian Elections: Hindu party's rise unsettles Moslem north
 -There is a tangible sense of fear in the towns of Uttar Pradesh
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Around the white-washed village mosques of northern India and in the densely
populated Moslem areas of the main towns, there is a tangible sense of fear
as this election campaign enters its final phase.
Maulana Mannan Raza Khan, a Moslem cleric in Bareilly, a market town in
central Uttar Pradesh where 25 per cent of the population is Moslem, says
Moslems are beginning to ask themselves whether they should stay in the area
or leave for the duration of the election.
What seemed scarcely conceivable a few weeks ago has now become a distinct
possibility. The Hindu revivalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), campaigning
on a platform of establishing a Hindu state, has generated such a wave of
support that it could emerge as the single largest party in next week's
polls.
In Uttar Pradesh, the largest state of the union and the traditional
barometer of electoral swings, Mr Rajiv's Gandhi's Congress party seems
everywhere on the defensive.
By contrast, local BJP officials are triumphantly self- confident. 'There is
a wave sweeping in our favour,' says a party worker at Bara Banki, near
Lucknow, a constituency with no previous record of returning the Hindu
revivalist party.
A BJP-led government is still the less likely outcome to this election. But
the pace of the party's advance has caught Moslems off balance and for the
first time faced them with the prospect of a party coming to power on a
platform that they feel threatens their religious and cultural identity.
Moslems account for 12 per cent of India's population or more than 100m
people.
'If the BJP comes to power and implements the policies in its manifesto',
says Dr Kalbe Sadiq, the leader of the Shia community in Lucknow and a
senior Moslem known for his moderation, 'then we will have to protect our
identity and the basic fundamentals of Islam.'
A central plank of the manifesto is the BJP's pledge to push ahead with the
construction of a Hindu temple at Ayodhya on the site of a former mosque.
The building of the temple has become a symbol of confrontation with Islam.
Another commitment is the introduction of a uniform civil code which would
replace Islamic personal law. Other Moslem clerics are far more belligerent.
'Moslems cannot live in a Hindu rashtra (state),' says Maulana Raza Khan.
'We would have to fight - to issue a fatwa (decree) for a crusade.'
This election is witnessing a greater polarisation between Hindus and
Moslems than any previous campaign. As Hindu votes in the north gravitate
towards the BJP, Moslem votes are swinging to what seems the party best
placed in any one constituency to defeat it. The Congress party had hoped to
benefit from a consolidation of the Moslem vote against the BJP. But in many
constituencies the Janata Dal or the Communists are the main challengers.
The Moslem vote is thus divided - with the BJP reaping the benefit.
Moslems hope that if the BJP did come to power, reason would prevail, and
that a repetition of the Hindu-Moslem violence that has cost more than 2,000
lives in the past year can be avoided.
'We feel no hate for Hindus,' say Moslem villagers at Bhojpuri, near
Bareilly. They point to the Brahmin families in the village who in the past
have protected them at times of communal tension.
Many orthodox, middle-class Hindus, who for the first time are backing the
BJP because of their disillusionment with the other parties, have also
convinced themselves that the BJP in power would not implement the
controversial parts of its programme. Nonetheless this campaign is sowing
seeds of religious hatred that will be difficult to remove.
In the shade of a mango orchard on the edge of Bhojpuri, a local leader of
the Hindu extremist RSS movement - the parent organisation of the BJP -
blames Moslems for the secessionist movements in Kashmir, Assam and Punjab.
'Why is it,' he asks his audience, 'that wherever there are Moslems there is
a demand for a separate state?'
Some Moslems concede that the Moslem community itself must bear much of the
blame for Hindu resentment and anger. Hindus feel that Moslems are dragging
down the country's economic growth by higher rates of illiteracy and
population growth.
Dr Kalbe says that Islamic doctrine permits certain types of family
planning. But most Moslem clerics in India are adamantly opposed to it.
Even if the BJP emerges with the most seats, Moslems hope that other parties
will ally to prevent it coming to power. But they feel a reprieve may be
only temporary.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Israel to seek EC law on Arab boycott of companies
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL is expected today to ask Brussels to extend the anti-Arab-boycott
legislation that already exists in two EC states to Community level.
The expected request by Mr David Levy, the Israeli foreign minister, to a
formal EC-Israel meeting here coincides with growing interest in the
Community, as well as the US, in at least an easing of the Arab boycott of
companies trading with Israel as a confidence-building measure to boost
Middle East peace efforts.
On Saturday, several EC foreign ministers urged the six Gulf Co-operation
Council members to use their influence within the Arab League for an easing
of the boycott. The latter said this was only conceivable in the context of
an Arab-Israeli peace deal.
France and the Netherlands have national laws forbidding their companies to
give the Arab Boycott Office formal undertakings they will not trade with
Israel.
The Israeli government wants such legislation adopted by the EC as a whole,
arguing, among other points, that general Arab incitement creates commercial
distortion.
Germany and Denmark now sympathise with the Israeli view, but most other EC
states want to wait and see how Israel responds to peace overtures and
prefer to exert quiet political pressure on the Arabs.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Saudis to take up Dollars 4.5bn loan: First fund-raising
from banks for at least 20 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Euromarkets Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAUDI ARABIA is close to calling upon a Dollars 4.5bn (Pounds 2.66bn) loan
from international banks, having negotiated an increase in the loan's size
and a reduction in the interest margin charged, bankers said yesterday.
They said a loan agreement had been signed by the Saudi government and 20
international banks this month in Paris. The loan, arranged by JP Morgan of
New York, should be drawn down shortly.
The financing, the first fund-raising by the government from international
banks for at least 20 years, was first negotiated in February, before the
ground assault on Kuwait had been launched by the US-led coalition. Then,
the three-year loan was for Dollars 3.5bn and the interest margin over
London interbank offered rates, the floating benchmark used in the
international loans market, set at  1/2 percentage point.
Bankers said at the time that the loan carried a war risk premium. The
Saudis used the swift ending of the war to negotiate a reduction in the
interest margin to  3/8 point over Libor. Morgan also brought in new banks
to increase the size of the transaction.
Difficulties over the loan documentation apparently delayed the signing. The
purpose of the loan is general, although it is possible that at least some
of it will be used to pay the Saudi contribution to the coalition war
effort. It pledged Dollars 13.5bn to the US.
The Saudi government has tried to to keep the fund-raising quiet, as it is
seen as a source of embarrassment inside the country because of the Islamic
proscription against usury. However, there are expectations that it will
have to raise more soon. Although benefiting from higher oil prices and
increased oil production resulting from the Gulf crisis, the Saudis insist
they have lost out because of the cost of the war.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Bank of Japan urges review on foreign workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of Japan has called for an immediate review of Japan's virtual ban
on the employment of foreign workers, in a rare public comment on a
highly-sensitive political problem.
In a report on the country's labour shortage published this month, the
central bank says that 'the employment of foreign workers is an urgent issue
which requires examination from every angle'.
The fear that labour shortages increase the risk of inflation has played a
central part in the bank's decision to push up interest rates over the past
two years. It will remain a key factor in future management of the economy,
says the report.
'It is a grave concern that a growing scarcity in labour supply,
particularly in the younger age brackets, might cause serious labour
shortages in future.'
The recent shortages have been caused not only by a cyclical surge in
economic growth but also by long-term changes in the economy, including a
shift to greater demand for labour-intensive services. At the same time,
with the ageing of society, the growth of the workforce has slowed, says the
report. The central bank says that in 1996 the working population will start
to decline.
The decline is being alleviated by increases in the employment of women,
investment in labour-saving equipment, growth in the import of
labour-intensive manufactured goods and the transfer of factories overseas.
'In order to achieve non-inflationary economic growth under limited supply
of labour, these changes in the economy must continue steadily.'
Japan also has to carry out measures which will allow for the employment of
more women and more older people, says the central bank. It also has to
press on with deregulation and rationalisation in the distribution system to
release more labour. Companies need to adjust management plans. Meanwhile,
as for macro-economic policy, priorities should be 'maintaining price
stability and avoiding a vicious spiral of wages and price increases'.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Carey's 'assault on poverty'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DR GEORGE CAREY, who was enthroned as Archbishop of Canterbury and head of
the international Anglican communion last month, yesterday made a 'fresh
assault on poverty' a priority of his time in office, Alan Pike, Social
Affairs Correspondent, writes.
'When I travel abroad, beginning with my trip to Papua New Guinea this
summer, I shall make it my business to visit poor communities and learn how
best we can be alongside them in their struggles,' he said.
All Britons, said Dr Carey, should use the opportunities of democracy to
'encourage the government of the day as it plays its part in the fight
against world poverty'.
While welcoming recent pledges by the UK government - including a commitment
to increase the aid budget to the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of
gross domestic product as soon as possible - he made it clear that he
believes international aid must receive a higher priority.
He said UK government efforts to ease third world debt burdens should be
encouraged. 'We in the richer countries received in debt repayments last
year the equivalent of Pounds 17 for each man, woman and child in countries
most affected by poverty.'

FT  14 MAY 91 / Baker puts on brave face as Mideast mission wavers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR James Baker, the US secretary of state, takes his Middle East peace
mission to Jordan and Israel today with little sign of any tangible progress
in his efforts to convene a regional peace conference.
After talks yesterday in Cairo with his Soviet counterpart, Mr Alexander
Bessmertnykh, Mr Baker told reporters that there were 'significant
differences' between Israel and Syria on a UN role at a proposed conference,
and on the exact nature of the gathering.
Damascus is pressing for a comprehensive settlement of the Middle East
dispute on the basis of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, which
require Israel to withdraw from land occupied in the 1967 war, including
Syria's Golan Heights. But Israeli leaders discount UN participation, saying
the world body is biased.
Israel is also against a regional conference that has any status beyond that
of a ceremonial 'opening' to direct talks with its neighbours. Syria wants a
regional gathering to have a role in overseeing peace moves.
With the Baker mission hung up on these procedural issues, other knotty
questions are tending to be overlooked at this stage, such as the perennial
problem of who might represent the Palestinians. Mr Baker is pressing for a
joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation to overcome Israel's objection to
sitting down with representatives of the Palestine Liberation Organisation,
which it describes as a 'terrorist gang'.
Officials close to Mr Baker have warned that if by the end of the week there
is little sign of progress, the US secretary of state will abandon his
latest round of peace-making and return to Washington.
Mr Baker is seeking to put the best public face on a very unpromising
situation, but in private US officials have sounded pessimistic. A rash of
statements from Mr Yitzhak Shamir, Israel's premier, in the past few days
insisting that there would be no territorial compromise have cast a
deepening shadow over the Baker mission.
Mr Bessmertnykh tried to sound a faint note of optimism after his meeting
with Mr Baker, telling reporters that 'our talks on the Middle East have
reached a large plateau.' Problems were fewer than before which gave 'ground
for hope', he added.
Mr Bessmertnykh was due to meet Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO leader, in Geneva
today. 'They are meeting here on Tuesday but that's all I can say at this
stage,' said a PLO official in Geneva.

IRAN pressed ahead with its commitment to the private sector by announcing
yesterday the sell-off of IR100bn worth of shares in state-owned companies
this year. The sale is equivalent to about Pounds 44m at the floating
exchange rate.
Mr Mohammed Reza Nematzadeh, industry minister, made the announcement in
Tehran. Around 70 per cent of industry is in government hands. President
Hashemi Rafsanjani's government is committed to the sale of state-owned
assets, many nationalised after the 1979 revolution. Strategic heavy
industries will remain in the public sector.
Transfer of most mines to private sector and co-operatives has been
approved.

FT  14 MAY 91 / German parties' bickering may stall Poland pact
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONTINUED bickering between Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrat
party and its sister party, the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU), could
delay the signing of an important friendship treaty between Germany and
Poland.
The conservative CSU's routine complaint about lack of influence in the Bonn
coalition has reached a new pitch since the Christian Democrat defeat in the
Rhineland-Palatinate state election. Despite Mr Kohl's initially disdainful
response to CSU attacks, he has now decided to concede to the Bavarians a
round of consultation on the Poland treaty, to take place today.
The treaty, which was to be initialled today and is due to be signed
formally on June 17, spells out the minority rights for ethnic Germans in
Poland. Polish President Lech Walesa is expected to visit Germany after it
is ratified.
Although it has been welcomed by most German politicians, including many in
the CSU, the treaty was negotiated almost single-handed by the Free Democrat
foreign minister, Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, whom conservatives accuse of
monopolising German foreign policy.
This is particularly irritating for the CSU, which considers itself, along
with conservative Christian Democrats, the champion of ethnic Germans
throughout eastern Europe. At today's meeting the CSU is likely to call for
closer monitoring of the treaty rights for ethnic Germans and clarification
over the issue of dual citizenship.
The centre-right coalition also faces a further dispute over the need to
merge east Germany's liberal abortion laws with the more restrictive laws in
west Germany. The Free Democrats support an extension to west Germany of the
old east German law allowing abortion on demand in the first three months of
pregnancy to be qualified only by compulsory counselling. This has been
attacked by the CSU and many Christian Democrats as too liberal.
Mr Heinrich Franke, president of Germany's Federal Labour Office, said
yesterday that between 10,000 and 20,000 east Germans were still moving to
west Germany every month.

FT  14 MAY 91 / Hungary takes the lead on foreign investment / A look at who
is really getting down to business after the post-communist euphoria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN investment in eastern Europe is beginning cautiously to take off
after a false start during the brief post-communist euphoria. It has gone
farthest in Hungary, traditional testbed for the region's economic
experiments, where liberal foreign investment laws appeared first more than
two years ago.
Central Budapest has lost some of the bustle of a year ago, when the flurry
of visiting western businessmen gave the impression of a town in the middle
of a gold rush. The Forum Hotel is no longer booked for months ahead and
consultants complain less of 'corporate tourists' besieging them.
But, shorn of the early grandiose hopes and the disappointment which dashed
them, investment in Hungary has quietly become substantial.
Half of all foreign investment in east Europe (excluding Germany) went to
Hungary in 1990, says Mr Bela Kadar, minister of international economic
relations. True, that reflects how little has flowed to the rest of the
region as much as it does Hungary's own success.
Foreign direct investment in the country last year amounted to something
between Dollars 750m and Dollars 1bn - either figure is but a fraction of
that enjoyed by the south European or south-east Asian countries which
compete with east Europe for investment.
Accumulated investment is also only 3.5 - 4 per cent of the Hungarian
company sector, so there is a long way to go to reach the government's 25
per cent medium-term target.
Nevertheless, it is early yet and the trend is sharply upwards. Companies'
financial reports showed Ft93.2bn (Dollars 1.53bn) of accumulated foreign
investment at the end of 1990, compared with Ft29.3bn a year earlier.
Officials expect another Dollars 1bn this year. In newspapers and
sugar-refining, foreign ownership has penetrated deep. Foreign media
companies now have dominant stakes in all Hungary's main national daily
newspapers.
Even more dramatically, the number of joint ventures registered jumped from
900 at the end of 1989 to about 7,500 at the end of March, according to
Central Statistical Office estimates. In addition, there are another 1,200
companies with foreign stakes.
Officials and economists caution that many Hungarian businesses have set up
joint ventures simply to avoid tax or customs. A better - albeit indirect -
indication of a surge in interest is the breakneck pace of expansion of
western accountancy and law firms in the past 18 months.
Even so, consultants are finding it difficult to keep up with a quickening
rhythm of large acquisitions and new investments. The conclusions of deals
worth more than Dollars 40m are running at more than one a month so far this
year. Moreover, many more transactions are in the offing as Hungary's
flagship First Privatisation Programme begins to take off.
Investors are attracted particularly to Hungary because of the official
welcome it gives to foreign capital. Western lawyers praise the foreign
investment and company acts for their western quality. Officials boast that
the country has the most liberal investment regime in the world, citing the
right to set up in the service sector, acquire majority control without
special permission and fully repatriate profits. The company law mimics the
German. Better, the laws have improved with use in the two years they have
been in effect.
So much for the principle. The practice has been frustrating, which makes
the growth in foreign investment all the more impressive.
The first problem, especially for deals involving real estate, is to find
someone with the authority to sell a property. Central and local authorities
and current occupiers and former owners make rival claims. A recent act
compensating the last group should help but it leaves questions unanswered.
Nor is approval from the State Property Agency, the central privatisation
authority, easily obtained. It sometimes treats well-known international
companies 'shabbily', says one senior consultant. The agency promises a
decision on whether to give the go-ahead to a serious proposal and then
delays it, again and again, without explanation.
Negotiations themselves are an endurance test. Foreign buyers, state company
managers, SPA officials, the enterprise council representing the workforce,
and various accountants, valuators and legal counsels - all participate.
Turnout at these unwieldy meetings in smoke-filled rooms can easily reach 25
and the whole group goes through agreements word by word, says Mr Theodore
Boone, a lawyer at Baker &amp; McKenzie.
'Hungarian managers are willing to bring up issues again which everybody
thought the book had been closed on.'
Price can be a particular stumbling block because valuations vary wildly. 'A
company's past record is meaningless and everything around it is in flux,'
says Mr Istvan Denes, managing director of the First Hungary Fund, an
investment fund. That can lead to big gaps between negotiating positions.
Even once the negotiations are over, the formalities of setting up a new
joint venture can hold things up. One of the tightest bottle-necks is the
company registration court whose 15 overworked judges can take three months
to handle an application.
Patience has been one of a potential investor's most valuable qualities. One
investment fund which has made it a particular virtue is John Govett's
Hungarian Investment Company.
'HIC avoided the mistakes others did by diligence and investing a lot of
time,' says Mr Adam Batthany, a prime ministerial adviser who doubles as a
board member.
Patience is also needed more generally. It takes time to implement essential
laws and rules; even longer for them to be worn in and for business culture
to change.
Hungary is at least showing that the delay, while frustrating, is not fatal
for investment in east Europe. Investment is taking off, and, says Mr Denes:
'It's getting easier by the day to get things done.'

Described by Borba as 'a soldier for a time of crisis', he is a member of Mr
Ante Markovic's federal government. But until recently he supported the
Communist Party - Movement for Yugoslavia, a revived party formed by retired
army officers and hardline Communists.
However, he has exercised a moderating influence on the army's leadership
following the outbreak of ethnic violence between Serbs and Croats two weeks

FT  13 MAY 91 / Monday Interview: M'learned friend's tough brief - Michael
Howard, UK employment secretary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HARGREAVES and JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In his short ministerial life, Mr Michael Howard has played many parts, all
to mixed reviews. He piloted the Financial Services Bill through the Commons
with great technical skill, but some think without much real feel for the
task in hand. He was responsible for the poll tax legislation, about which
no more need be said; and he ran water privatisation, eventually to acclaim,
although at one point it looked as if his own career might not prosper as a
result. Now, only eight years after becoming an MP, he is employment
secretary as unemployment has crashed through the 2m barrier for the second
time since the Tories took office in 1979.
It is difficult to ruffle Mr Howard. He spent the years between 1970, when
he failed for a second time to capture Liverpool Edge Hill, and 1983 when he
won the safe-ish seat of Folkestone and Hythe, building up his reputation at
the Bar. Once he has taken a brief, he does not easily yield; colleagues
report that following Mrs Thatcher's demise, he remained one of the
cabinet's staunchest poll tax diehards.
But people say Mr Howard is a briefcase carrier rather than a gut
politician; that he is clever but lacks conviction or passion and that he
has never had an original political thought in his life.
At the first charge, one detects a modest stirring of Welsh blood - the son
of a dress-shop owner, he went to Llanelli Grammar School. 'I care deeply
and passionately about people, about issues and about the future of this
country,' he says.
But to the second charge, he pleads guilty. 'I'm not sure you would find all
that many practising politicians who can lay claim to original ideas. I
think the art of politics is selecting the best of the ideas which
originally were thought of by those not active in politics and making an
assessment whether they will work and achieve the result you wish to
achieve.' Before the interview, his office said he had written no political
pamphlets; a fact which turns out not to be quite correct. He has in fact
co-authored two: one about the economy with his old friend Norman Lamont -
Howard was best man at the chancellor's wedding  - and the other,
improbably, with Mr Julian Critchley advancing the case of the East African
Asians. He is due to publish one solo this week but it is just a rehash of
Central Office nostrums.
It is not hard to identify the badge on Mr Howard's philosophical cap. He
pays homage to Iain Macleod; but above all, remains loyal to the founders of
Thatcherism. 'I think we have established the tramlines along which we
intend to travel; they were established during the last 12 years,' he says.
One aim of this interview is to find out whether the Thatcherite Mr Howard,
surrounded by his paintings of the Battle of Blenheim, envisages any change
in employment policy in the light of the change at Number 10.
His straight answer to this question is an uncompromising 'No. My agenda was
clearly set when I arrived here.'
At the top was and is training. He has had the task of implementing the
blueprint to create 82 employer-led and dominated Training and Enterprise
Councils across the land. 'I can speak for a very long time about this,' he
says menacingly, having already spoken for several minutes about this 'very
exciting initiative'.
It is indeed an important, if last-gasp attempt to smarten up Britain's
bedraggled training system, by handing the task to committees led on a
part-time basis by top local businessmen. He admits no doubt about the
sustainability of the approach, although he says he is frequently tested in
his determination to stick to the principle that the businessmen involved
must be of chief operating officer grade, rather than, say, personnel
directors. 'I remain of the view that it's right to stick to these demanding
criteria,' he says.
He is also not impressed with the other grumbles Tec chairman vent in
private. He thinks the Tecs are on target to deliver their guaranteed levels
of performance and that they should work through the current financial year
before he considers any further change to their freedom to shift funds from
one area of work to another. The Tecs, says Mr Howard, already have more
financial and operating flexibility than any comparable body, something
which has made them richly inventive.
On the future of trades union law, he is elusive. Having suggested early in
his term of office that the Thatcher decade had completed the job, he now
appears to be wavering. 'We keep it under review and we must always look to
see whether there's a need for further change in the law. Some recent
developments, such as the episode of the NUM (the Scargill financial
controversy), have clearly indicated that the law needs attention, but we
haven't reached any decisions yet on what the manifesto should say.' Among
the issues he has in mind are the powers of union certification officers,
the penalties for improper accounting and access by members to their unions'
financial affairs.
The government's biggest problem in the employment area, however, continues
to be excessive wage pressure during a period of disinflation. He is
scornful of suggestions that some move towards a national economic
assessment or co-ordinated pay bargaining might have a role, sticking to the
Thatcherite dictum: 'Locally devolved pay bargaining is likely to be the
most effective.' The creation of a pay review body for the teachers was, he
insists, a special case. 'I don't see that as a precursor for a profusion of
review bodies in other areas.'
Assuming that Mr Howard continues to speak for his party on these matters,
that suggests a potentially widening gap with a Labour party committed to a
minimum wage, upon which subject Mr Howard adopts his most practised silk's
scorn for a piece of bogus court-room evidence. He appears to harbour no
fear that the public mood is moving against him in this area. Nor, however,
does he have a convincing explanation as to why this attitude should not be
applied to wages councils, which set minimum wages for 2.5m workers in
certain sectors. 'We see no permanent place for wages councils in our
system,' he says, but declines to say when the fox will be shot.
He has been asked so often what it feels like to preside over another
outbreak of mass unemployment that the answers are cut and tucked into sound
bites; Britain still has below average unemployment in Europe etc. The
government's job, he says, is to persist with the right, firm financial
framework and to take the consequences. That is what he means, he says, when
he talks about the relentless, practical struggle over many years to apply
the chosen political philosophy.
It is only when we turn to Europe that there is a sign of the Majoresque
emollience. Mr Howard, like his former boss, enjoyed playing rough on
Europe, once accusing Ms Vasso Papandreou, the social affairs commissioner,
of bringing the Community into disrepute. On the day that Mrs Thatcher
resigned, officials in Mrs Papandreou's directorate were jubilant at the
thought that it might mean the end of Mr Howard.
Today, however, his tone is softer. He always used to say that one third of
the social charter was totally unacceptable, a third possibly negotiable and
a third, mainly that pertaining to health and safety, fine.
Now, he says, 'it looks as though a dozen out of 50 proposals are likely to
be unacceptable', although it remains unclear which of these will be
determined by qualified majority and therefore leave Britain out-voted. 'We
have done quite well so far, but there's no guarantee that we shall be able
to construct the necessary minority on all the proposals.'
The more mellow atmosphere, he says, stems partly from a deal he struck with
Ms Papandreou earlier this year, when she agreed that draft directives would
be shown to member governments before publication and when she agreed to
accept additional help to improve the so-called 'impact statements'
evaluating the costs and consequences of proposed measures.
He must, one imagines, be a formidable opponent in EC ministerial councils.
He does his homework, enjoys detail and displays no self-doubt about
fundamentals. He has missed only one such council, which took place at the
height of the leadership election, when he was doing his lonely best to
ensure that Mrs Thatcher fought on.
Now she has gone, he will not say whether he thinks the party's chances of
election victory have increased or diminished. Personal intimations of
mortality were delivered in the recent local council elections, when
Folkestone was lost to the Liberal Democrats.
Indeed, he makes little of the much discussed change of style at Number 10,
preferring instead to laud another of the new prime minister's qualities.
'It's determination that matters,' he says, 'battling.'

recalls 1,830 Saturn cars

<TEXT>
UP TO 1,830 vehicles in General Motors new Saturn line, intended to
demonstrate the US car company's competitiveness against its Japanese
rivals, are to be recalled.
GM's Saturn division, initiated in 1983, says 7 per cent of the vehicles it
has built since it began production last autumn, must be replaced because
they were filled with a faulty coolant which could damage the engine. The
coolant was supplied by a Texaco subsidiary.
This is the second recall of Saturn cars. The first, in February, involved
1,210 vehicles with a faulty seat mechanism, which the company also blamed
on a supplier.
The latest recall is believed to represent the first offer by a large motor
manufacturer to replace an entire vehicle for a problem of this type. It
demonstrates the importance GM attaches to creating an image of reliability
for Saturn.
Saturn, a small car made largely from plastics, is an attempt by GM to
compete with the quality and production standards of the small, imported
Japanese cars which have a big share of the US domestic market.
The project has involved ground-breaking agreements with unions, suppliers
and dealers. GM's investment amounts to about Dollars 4bn.

FT  13 MAY 91 / International Company News: Dresdner moves into private
banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KATHARINE CAMPBELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DRESDNER Bank is following the lead of its larger rival Deutsche Bank and
setting up a private banking house aimed at creating a more exclusive
service for increasingly wealthy and sophisticated German private investors.
Hardy &amp; Co Privatbankiers, opening at the beginning of July, will have the
characteristics of a private bank, while tapping the resources and
technology of the Dresdner Bank group.
While no minimum wealth criteria have been revealed, Dresdner suggested it
was targeting investors with a net worth of roughly DM5m (Dollars 2.9m) or
more.
Hardy &amp; Co, a private bank set up in Berlin in 1880, was merged into the
Deutsche Landerbank, a subsidiary of Dresdner 10 years ago. The latter sold
the Landerbank to Swiss Banking Corporation in 1985, but retained the name
of Hardy &amp; Co, which it is now using to set up the new bank.
Dresdner will own 100 per cent of the capital, but Hardy &amp; Co's private
banking identity will be underlined by two personally liable partners
running the business. Based in Frankfurt, it will start operations with a
staff of around 40.
Mr Utz Pfannschmidt, one of the two partners, stressed the bank would work
within, not in competition with, the rest of the Dresdner group, catering
for high net worth investors whose increasingly sophisticated requirements
could not be met as effectively in the existing structure.
The so-called inheritance generation in Germany is presenting the big banks
with a considerable challenge as to how to retain such clients. Deutsche
Bank has, for instance, bought a stake of more than 80 per cent in the old
private bank Grunelius.
Mr Gerhard Eberstadt, managing board member in charge of securities and
investment, estimated the operation would break even over a period of
between three and five years, in what he described as a 'growth market par
excellence'.

FT  13 MAY 91 / International Company News: Lavalin plans big sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAVALIN, the big Canadian engineering and manufacturing group, plans to
return to basics after a decade of heady expansion.
Most of its industrial holdings are being put up for sale.
The group, with annual revenues of more than USDollars 1bn, wants to
concentrate on its engineering and project management business, developed
internationally in the 1960s and 1970s.
Lavalin has built its reputation in energy, transportation, aluminium
smelting, pulp and paper and many other industrial sectors.
Mr Bernard Lamarre, chairman, is offering half Lavalin's 85 per cent
interest in UTDC, an Ontario rail equipment maker, and all of Kemtec, a
specialised petrochemical producer in Montreal.
Together, they have annual sales of about USDollars 500m, are losing money
and require injections of new capital.
Lavalin bought UTDC in 1986 from the Ontario government, which retains a 15
per cent interest. UTDC pioneered the Vancouver Skytrain people-mover, which
Lavalin has tried to sell worldwide.
Kemtec has taken a severe blow from declining petrochemical prices.

Reichmann empire

<TEXT>
PROBLEMS with tenants and subsidiaries are having a domino effect on some
credit ratings of the Reich-mann brothers' business empire.
Standard &amp; Poor's lowered its rating on the Reichmanns' 59 Maiden Lane in
New York, citing a tenant of the big office development and the parlous
state of the New York property market as problems.
A USDollars 200m issue of Euro-notes due 1995 secured on 59 Maiden Lane was
downgraded to A- from AA. However the agency said this did not affect
Olympia and York Developments, the Reichmanns' core holding company.
Moody's downgraded nearly USDollars 1bn of Gulf Canada Resources debt
because of the company's poor profit prospects and declining interest
coverage.
The Gulf Canada senior debentures were lowered to Baa-3 from Baa-1. About
USDollars 150m of short-term debt issued by a Reichmann property subsidiary
in Calgary, Alta, was also downgraded because a leading leaseholder is Gulf
Canada.
The Reichmanns have several big resource holdings, including Gulf Canada,
which operates in oil and gas developments in North America and south-east
Asia.

AEROSPATIALE of France and Italy's Alenia, which have agreed to buy de
Havilland of Canada, are asking the Canadian and Ontario governments to chip
in as much as CDollars 500m (USDollars 434.7m) towards the cost of
modernising the struggling aircraft maker's facilities, writes Bernard
Simon.
Executives of the two European companies, shareholders in the ATR
commuter-aircraft consortium, said the governments' contribution would be
about half the amount needed to maintain de Havilland's design and
production capacity at its plant in Toronto.
Mr Fausto Cereti, Alenia's chief executive, said ATR wanted to create the
world's leading manufacturer of commuter aircraft.

<TEXT>
The market seems to be feeling like I do some mornings. The telephone rings;
perhaps if I go back to sleep it will go away. Despite thin trading, stock
prices go on behaving as if the institutions were flooded with cash. Reality
breaks through for a day, always with some utterly predictable bad news, and
then fades. The ostrich mood was perfectly expressed by a broker interviewed
by one of the wire services in London on Friday evening. Asked to comment on
the week's profit warnings, he was ready: 'I don't believe it's as bad as
they say.'
In a sense, it never is as bad as they say; once a board steels itself to
issuing a warning, it always tries to make sure that it will not have to
issue a second. There is no reason at all, though, to assume that boards are
shading their warnings more than they usually do. Costs are still rising,
sales are very weak, and interest rates are being held deliberately high;
the average company is bound to suffer.
The UK economy is not going through a normal cyclical downturn, but a savage
morning after. Every country which has joined the European monetary club as
a cure for structural inflation has suffered some years of acute discomfort.
Britain, by doing so after a period of financial excess, has ensured that
the adjustment will be more painful than many. The corporate escape from the
credit squeeze, at least, has been well mapped: the steady stream of rights
issues, each greeted with unaccountable shock.
Efficient market theorists will argue that all these uncomfortable facts are
discounted in present price levels, and some cite the high dividend yields
of UK equities in support of this idea. But the international yield gap is
normal, and the reactions to news which ought to have been expected suggests
that the news is not discounted. On the contrary, it suggests that the
market is indulging in the wishful thinking always found at bull market
climaxes - reading its picture of reality from its own price level. This is
as rational as raising morale by grinning at yourself in your shaving
mirror.
This used to be quite a habit on Wall Street. The official US leading
economic indicator formerly gave more weight to stock prices than it does
now. The result was that when the market had a good run, the leading
indicator rose, and this was taken as confirmation that high stock prices
were justified. The Street grew wiser after 1987, and so did the
statisticians. Stock prices have been de-emphasised, and the market takes
less notice of the leading indicator.
In other respects, the buoyancy of Wall Street is easier to justify than
that of London. The consensus forecast is for a recovery, and the Fed is
doing all it can to encourage one. Unfortunately, it remains a matter of jam
tomorrow; the current news continues to be, mainly, worse then expected.
Consumer spending, which is supposed to energise the recovery, remains
depressed, despite the reported rise in confidence - not perhaps as
surprising as it may look, since real disposable incomes in the US have
taken their sharpest fall in 15 years.
Investment is dropping, construction is still on its slow way down, and
exports are not dynamic. Only the weakness of imports makes the fall in
output relatively shallow.
Yet while expectations about the US economy are probably drifting into touch
with reality, equity prices still make inadequate allowance for debt
problems. Something like last Friday's crisis at First National, the
Californian life insurance company, should have been discounted.
It has been obvious all along that in a depressed economy some companies
which issue junk bonds would be in trouble, and so would some companies that
held the bonds. Junk bond yields show that the bond market has been
rational; but the 50-point fall in equities after the First National
announcement suggests that reality stops there.
The bond market, however, is being unrealistic in another way. Market
comments, with some notable exceptions, are full of dire warnings about
inflation - warnings which may in fact prevent the Fed from easing any
further for some time. In fact, though, the only sign of inflation is in the
level of bond yields; and this owes more to German (and Japanese) inflation
expectations than to those in the US. As long as the US Treasury has to
compete with the Germans for long bond funds, it must compete on yields.
In the real US world, producer prices have fallen for four of the last five
months, and the prices of inputs are still very soft; price expectations in
industry are as weak as for the best part of two decades, wage rates follow
their usual sluggish American course, and productivity has been rising as
companies adjust to a soft market.
It would take a much more vigorous recovery in demand than even the wildest
optimists are now predicting to stretch capacity to the point where margins
can be pushed up aggressively. Current estimates are that US output could
rise at a 3-4 per cent rate for two years or more before any constraints
began to appear, but that is still in the unknown future. In such a time
frame US long bonds would surely look highly attractive; but the
disappointing response to last week's auctions confirm that this is not yet
the market view.
The danger is that if the market does come to believe in the low-inflation
scenario, while bond yields are still held up by German problems, the yield
gap between bonds and equities can only be closed on the equity side. In
this sense, the US equity market is potentially more vulnerable to good news
than to bad, while the London market may well be more vulnerable to Wall
Street than to reality.
Finally, a footnote about insider trading. Mr Alistair Alcock, a former
director of corporate finance at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, now at the University
of Buckingham, has sent me a couple of spirited articles he has written on
the subject in the New Law Journal, which may not be on your normal reading
list. He suggests that the insider trading law should be renamed the
Protection of Market-Makers Act, which gives you the tone. Try reading law
for a change.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Brooke in crucial Belfast meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and Our Belfast Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, will today try to rescue from
near collapse his plans for round-table talks on the province's future at
what could prove a 'make or break' meeting in Belfast.
Unionist and nationalist leaders are expected to be presented with
alternative suggestions for the venue of negotiations involving the Irish
government. If agreement cannot be reached, Mr Brooke will have to decide
whether it is worth continuing the talks.
Mr Brooke is believed to have discussed possible fall-back positions with Mr
Gerry Collins, Irish foreign minister, at a four-hour meeting in London on
Friday.
He has taken gambles before in his talks initiative; successfully bringing
Northern Ireland's constitutional parties together with a 'take it or leave
it' offer before Easter.
This time, the Northern Ireland Office appears to be hoping that, after a
weekend of reflection by the parties involved and the threat of an
embarrassingly early collapse of the talks, there will be sufficient
movement today for a compromise to be reached.
But Mr Brooke knows there will seem little point in continuing to debate a
logistical detail indefinitely. Failure to reach a compromise on this issue
suggests the goodwill believed to exist before talks started had been
exaggerated vastly. Already two weeks have passed, out of the 11 set aside
for round-table talks.
Mr James Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley, leaders of the Unionist parties,
again insisted at the weekend that they would not hold talks with Dublin
ministers anywhere in Ireland while the Republic's territorial claim to
Northern Ireland remained.
The nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party believes that meetings
should rotate between London, Dublin and Belfast.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Gilt securities win Bank's approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of England gives a clean bill of health today to the UK government
bond market - a part of Britain's financial sector vital to the government's
ability to borrow funds from the investment community for public spending.
The vote of confidence in the gilt-edged securities market - which only last
year emerged from a period of sustained losses - comes in a report from the
Bank on the financial arrangements underpinning the operations of
marketmakers in the securities.
Gilt marketmakers encompass 18 financial groups which buy and sell bonds in
a secondary market for the securities, mainly on behalf of customers such as
pension funds.
The marketmakers - through their role in buying gilts from the government
and selling them to the international investment community - are likely to
be important in the large programme of gilt issues expected this financial
year. Up to Pounds 15bn of new gilts may be issued during the year, as the
government is in deficit after four years of surplus.
Details of the financial system helping the gilt market to work smoothly are
contained in a report published by the Bank, before its quarterly bulletin
on Thursday. It says the amount of outstanding lending on short-term
positions by marketmakers - an indication of the amount of liquidity in the
gilt market - rose nearly threefold between 1986 and last year, from Pounds
2bn to Pounds 5bn-Pounds 6bn.
The arrangements for channelling funds to and from the gilt market on a
short-term basis were altered at the time of financial deregulation in the
City in 1986, otherwise known as Big Bang. This introduced a greater element
of competition into the market and attracted a number of new overseas
entrants, causing a squeeze on margins and a run of losses which ended only
last year when the gilt business as a whole made a small profit.
The Bank says the new information about liquidity illustrates confidence by
the marketmakers in their ability to borrow. It shows too that the
specialist groups lending to the gilt market may be well placed to increase
their financing operations in other fields such as equities, underpinning
London's role as an international financial centre.
The report mainly covers the activities of the nine specialist
stock-exchange money brokers, which lend money and stock to gilt
marketmakers. The specialist groups are James Capel, Cazenove, Lazard
Brothers, Prudential-Bache, LM (Moneybrokers), Sheppards, King &amp; Shaxson,
Lehman Brothers and Rowe &amp; Pitman.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Tory peers concerned over ECGD sale: Protests on level of
export insurance support may force government concessions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR TORY peers, including a former trade minister, are seriously
concerned about the level of government support for insuring exports, as
ministers press ahead with the privatisation of part of the Export Credits
Guarantee Department.
Protests over aid for insurance on exports to politically sensitive
countries in particular could force the government to make concessions in
the House of Lords through fear of provoking a large-scale revolt.
The bill paving the way for privatising the short-term credit insurance
operations of the ECGD is expected to reach the Lords next month.
Conservative peers publicly voicing anxiety include Lord Trefgarne, a former
trade minister, and Lord Weir, a former president of the Federation of
British Electrotechnical and Allied Manufacturers' Associations.
Lord Prior, chairman of GEC, is believed to share their anxiety. Others
include Lord Tombs, chairman of Rolls-Royce, who sits as an independent
crossbencher.
At the DTI, Lord Trefgarne was responsible for much of the early preparation
for the sale - including negotiations with the Treasury.
The disquiet reflects the widespread concern among British industrialists
about the level of state aid for exporters compared with overseas rivals,
and adds to the difficulties the government faces on the ECGD sale.
Only three companies have responded to the government's invitation to tender
for ECGD's short-term insurance business. One tender, from Trade Indemnity,
was an offer to collaborate with no money on the table.
In the Commons, Tory rebels succeeded at the bill's committee stage in
inserting a new clause committing the government to continue insuring UK
sales to politically risky developing countries for three years after
privatisation. The clause was overturned by the government, but is expected
to be reintroduced in the Lords.
Mr Tim Sainsbury, trade minister, sought to appease MPs and exporters with
an assurance that the need for a 'national interest facility' for political
risk reinsurance would be kept under review.
The government's intention was that the facility would continue as long as
it was considered 'essential to meet the reasonable needs of exporters', Mr
Sainsbury said.
However, Lord Trefgarne said: 'The assurances Mr Sainsbury gave, while
helpful, really didn't go far enough.' He also complained about recent
rises, in the face of substantial debts incurred, in the ECGD's premiums for
exports to more difficult markets.
'Ministers should follow the policy that I think previous ministers have
followed which is that British exporters should not be placed at any
disadvantage with their competitors . . . The truth of the matter is that
most of our competitors have lost even more and are prepared to go on doing
so,' said Lord Trefgarne.
Lord Weir said the government had to give 'strong, clear' assurances about
its support for export insurance in the event of the privatisation failing
to have the effect ministers predicted. 'Behind this, one really sees the
hands of the Treasury,' he said.
Lord Tombs said the DTI's stand on political risk insurance was 'indicative'
of its lack of commitment to supporting exporters. Manufacturers only wanted
the level of government support brought up to the same level as foreign
competitors.
'I think privatisation of the insurances is unlikely to improve the position
in the short term because of the government's refusal to take on what can
only be a government responsibility,' he said.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Criticism mounts over NHS reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE on the government over its health service reforms increased
yesterday when the Institute of Economic Affairs, a leading free market
think tank, joined mounting criticism of the way the changes are working.
The institute contributed ideas to the government review which led to the
introduction of the reforms and it does not question the need for
reorganising the National Health Service.
However, Dr David Green, director of the institute's health and welfare
unit, said yesterday that last month's changes in the hospital service and
forthcoming reforms of long-term care 'suffer from the same structural
flaw'. By rationing health care within cash limits 'arbitrarily set by
government' both reforms reduced consumer choice.
He said that the viability of London teaching hospitals such as Guy's -
which started the political uproar over the reforms by announcing about 600
job cuts last month - depended on attracting patients from outside the
capital.
While many patients would prefer to be treated in London teaching hospitals,
the reforms did not give them the choice. Allocation of money under the
reforms did not follow patients' wishes but went to 'where patients have
been assigned'.
The institute publishes a pamphlet today on the next stage of the reforms
contained in the National Health Service and Community Care Act  - changes
in provision for the long-term sick and elderly. Dr Green said these
reforms, coming into effect over the next few years, were retrograde and
would reduce elderly people's existing choice of care provision.
The institute would like individuals to be able to augment state spending on
the NHS through personal insurance arrangements - unlike the British Medical
Association, which is calling for increased public expenditure. While
proposed solutions vary, the current controversy over the health reforms has
made the adequacy of Britain's health care expenditure, which is low by
international standards, into a live political issue again.
The government is trying to shift the argument away from funding to the
outcome of health care. Later this month Mr William Waldegrave, health
secretary, will publish targets for monitoring and improving the nation's
health.
If the controversy over the reforms continues, however, there is a danger
for the government that the health targets exercise will become embroiled in
the heated argument over the adequacy of NHS funding.
The Association of Community Health Councils, which represents consumer
interests in the service, today joins criticism of the new general
practitioner fund-holding arrangements, under which some family doctors have
budgets and purchase hospital care for their patients.
For the first time, says the association, GPs will be subject to 'financial
risks' which may sometimes prevent them from providing the best care. In
other circumstances, fund holders might increase discrepancies in standards
by being able to negotiate favourable services for their patients.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Letter: A long wait to journey's end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Friday night, May 3, just before I was due to spend the Bank Holiday
weekend with friends in Norman-dy I received a call from them warning me
that there were spasmodic strikes by the French engineers on the boats. On
checking with Sealink in Newhaven I was told that the 10.15am sailing next
day would probably go ahead as planned - information repeated at 7.30am the
following morning.
On arriving at Victoria in very good time for the 8.32am connection the
notice-board announced that the train had been cancelled, without any other
information whatever. On trekking across to the so-called international
information office, someone helpfully suggested that I take the evening
boat-train connection to Newhaven, but without any assurance that there
would be a sailing even then. It was a Sealink matter and British Rail could
not help.
The Sealink office in Victoria was of course firmly closed until at least
9am, by which time I would have missed several connections to the coast.
Fortunately a bomb scare led to the evacuation of the international
information office and of some platforms, thus delaying departures. I
happened to have in my pocket the telephone number of Sealink in Newhaven. I
was told initially that the sailing had been cancelled, only to be
interrupted by a further message that it was going ahead after all. That was
precious little use to me, as it was far too late to reach Newhaven by any
conceivable method. On persisting with this mild objection, I was told to
take the next train to Dover and that Sealink in Calais would provide
transport to Dieppe.
At Dover a Sealink hostess assured me that a message had been sent by radio
ahead and that I would be met in Calais, intelligence repeated by the ship's
purser. But of course there was no-one at Calais, where all the baggage was
sent on to the railway station on the assumption that every non-car
passenger was going on to Paris. I found one minor Sealink official who put
me back on an empty bus going back to the embarkation area, assuring me - I
fear correctly  - that no message of any kind had been sent.
I then had to wait until the Calais manager could be found, as he was
sorting out dockside problems. He was willing to arrange a taxi, so long as
the Dieppe manager accepted that the lapses had occurred on the
Newhaven-Dieppe stretch. There was another wait as the Dieppe man too was
'busy sorting out dockside problems'.
Normally I only drop names in the last few minutes when all else has failed.
But I was reduced to giving my profession, saying who my host was and that
we were having a business dinner and that an extremely prominent member of
the French cabinet, who lives in the neighbourhood, might drop in to join
us. But even if President Francois Mitterrand had been expected it would
probably not have helped. What mattered was to establish the responsibility
within Sealink. I even had to give a hypocritical defence of British Rail.
After I had cooled down over a cup of coffee a message came over the tannoy
that I was wanted downstairs and a proud Calais manager told me he had
persuaded Dieppe to pay for a taxi.
My journey back was 'normal.' This means that I had to queue for a long time
to get on and off the boat and carry my own luggage. And, despite '1992' and
having a British passport, I had to queue again on board for a landing
document.
What is the moral? Sealink was taken over last year by an international
concern, Stena Line, from Sea Containers. Somehow I think it would all have
been very different if there had been competition between different
companies to carry passengers on that particular crossing.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Letter: An alibi for pay rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NICHOLAS STACEY.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, the apparent logic advanced for a few top businessmen's recent large
salary increases, as reported in the FT, has been (a) a bonus for the
previous year's good trading; (b) that non-executive (ie independent)
directors have determined and recommended the increase; (c) that a firm of
outside consultants (also independent) have recommended it.
Normally, the first of these reasons has much claim to merit as it is based
on performance. But it carries less weight in the present difficult times
when - as in the case of Prudential  - the rise was accompanied by a cut in
policyholders' bonus rates, by nine figure losses on forays into estate
agency and reduced profits.
The second and third reasons advanced cannot easily claim any such logic,
particularly if the companies whose boards have voted the increase have
suffered huge losses, as in the case of Midland Bank.
We live in a country of rising unemployment (with excessive wage
settlements), an increasing number of bankruptcies and a still unacceptably
high rate of inflation against which most people have little or no hedge.
Awarding company directors large salary increases seems particularly
unhelpful and insensitive in view of current economic conditions, even if
boards believe they have an alibi in the shape of outside consultants'
recommendations. In any event, the moral responsibility for the
implementation (or rejection) of such recommendations lies with the boards
which commissioned them.
The antennae of some company boards seem inadequately fine-tuned for
sensitivity. The disadvantages of living in an alibi society is that bad
judgments are too easily overlooked.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Letter: Regulatory regime in need of direction - The
government must start to give its network of industry regulators a clearer
purpose
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What do contraceptives and salt have in common with domestic telephone
calls, the BBC television licence fee, commuter rail fares in the
south-east, gas and electricity charges?
The answer - after a decade of free-market reforms  - is that they all have
their prices controlled by regulatory authorities.
Regulation in the UK, as the diverse list of products and services suggests,
not only lacks coherence but is seldom free of controversy. Regulators have
sprung up in an ad hoc way, largely in response to political requirements,
as government has privatised industries and opened them up to competition.
The Broadcasting Act 1990 created no fewer than six regulators to oversee
the television industry, for instance.
All the regulators, from the Office of Fair Trading, the utilities - gas
(Ofgas), telecommunications (Oftel), electricity (Offer), water (Ofwat) -
aviation and television last week gathered for the first time to discuss
their role at a conference organised by the Institute of Economic Affairs.
Having created a patchwork of regulatory bodies the government is starting
to consider how to give them a clearer purpose. Mr Peter Lilley, the trade
and industry secretary is leading the way by addressing how his department's
regulatory responsibilities should be made more coherent.
To carry out a thoroughgoing review of the regulators' roles, particularly
where the privatised utilities are concerned, Mr Lilley's advisers will have
to tackle several questions:
What criteria should be used to assess whether a regulator is working
efficiently?
In telecommunications, for instance, there have been complaints that it has
taken Oftel far too long to determine the price and conditions under which
BT should make its network available to other operators. Comparisons with
regulation in other countries might be one way of judging British
regulators; more comparisons between the domestic regulators may be useful.
One possibility suggested at the conference by Mr Centro Veljnowski, an IEA
economist, was to set up a Whitehall audit unit to examine the costs and
benefits of regulation and deregulation.
Do regulators need to be more activist to represent consumer interests?
One of the regulators' main tasks is to protect consumers against utilities
with monopoly power. Yet according to Mr Maurice Healey, director of the
National Consumer Council, one of the main hindrances faced by regulators is
that they can only react to plans proposed by the companies they regulate;
they cannot suggest or stipulate what strategies the companies should
follow. When BT proposed charging for its directory inquiries service, Oftel
was not able to propose an alternative which consumers might have preferred.
It could only comment upon BT's plans, says Mr Healey.
What scope is there for the regulators to promote competition?
Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director-general of Oftel, recognises his task is
considerably eased by new technology which is opening up areas of
competition in telecommunications. Because of this he can challenge BT with
the prospect of entrants coming into the market with new technologies such
as mobile telephones or cable television.
At the other end of the spectrum is the water industry, where there are no
prospects of technology-driven competition. This has led Mr Ian Byatt, the
regulator, to adopt so-called 'yardstick competition'. After comparing the
performance and costs of different water companies, Mr Byatt will set prices
so that all companies have to match the standards set by the best in the
industry.
As other regulators run up against the realistic limits to competition in
their industries, they too may have to turn to 'yardstick competition' to
assess the efficiency of the companies they regulate.
What should be the responsibility of regulators in maintaining the social
aspects of services provided by utilities?
Take telecommunications. As a nationalised company BT ran a national
network, charging uniform prices, with revenues from more profitable
business services offsetting loss-making domestic and rural services.
Promoting access to the telephone was part of a social policy sanctioned by
governments of both parties.
As a privatised company, which faces growing competition, BT's services are
likely to become more tailored to different customer groups, which will be
charged different prices. There are concerns among Labour critics and trade
unions that less affluent, less profitable residential customers will be
overlooked in the new world of competition.
Oftel and the government will come under pressure to lay out a clear
framework for the relationship between the commercial and social aspects of
telecommunications markets and how these social obligations should be
financed. All the regulators will face this question of balancing social and
commercial demands once competition intensifies.
Should the regulators be more open in the way they reach decisions?
Agreements with the companies they regulate are often concluded in secrecy.
Although all the regulators conduct extensive research into their
industries, their conclusions are rarely published. Consumers cannot be sure
that the regulator has not been quietly 'captured' by the company it
regulates. This is one of the dangers of regulation: gradually the
regulators 'go native' and start promoting the interests of the industry
rather than those of the consumers.
In the US, regulation is much more open with hearings held at state and
federal level to inquire into company plans. The risk there is that this
quasi-judicial system, in which companies give evidence to public hearings,
makes the process adversarial and inflexible, says Mr Robert Osgood, a
specialist in US regulation with legal firm Sullivan &amp; Cromwell.
'There is another problem,' says Mr Osgood. 'Judges do not make a coherent
management team.'
Even if such a judicial system is rejected there is a case for requiring
greater openness from the regulators, perhaps modelled on select committee
inquiries. The regulators could hold bi-annual reviews of a company's
performance which would take evidence from interested parties. The
background to important decisions such as significant changes to price caps
should be made public.
Mr Byatt at Ofwat is leading the way in consulting consumers. His office
recently sent out 17m leaflets and held public meetings to seek consumer
views on plans to change the way people pay for water services.
Who should regulators be accountable to and how should they be held
accountable?
Regulators should serve consumers, yet their masters are really government
ministers. There is the additional danger that if the regulators evade the
influence of their companies, they may still be captured by politicians and
encouraged to bend to the demands of political expediency.
Yet, as the system of regulation is likely to remain a feature of these
industries for many years, it would make sense for the regulators to have a
power base independent of politicians. An alternative to appointment by
ministers would be for subscribers to utility services to elect regulators
on the basis of customer manifestos. Their power would then rest upon the
relationship with the consumers they serve rather than with ministers.
Should the regulators be brought together under one umbrella to create
greater coherence in their policies?
The idea of a regulator-in-chief has been proposed by the Labour party. It
sounds plausible but is probably unnecessary. All the utility regulators
rely on the support of the OFT and the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Sir Bryan Carsberg says: 'The MMC's role as a backstop is very important to
underline our powers.'
In the gas industry, the MMC's inquiries in the industrial gas market were
one spur for Ofgas to take more radical action than it had planned. One
possibility would be for the MMC to be more active as an independent auditor
of the regulators' performance.
If the system has been successful with the privatised monopoly utilities,
could it be extended to other areas of monopoly which remain in the public
sector?
According to Mr Healey, the most important priority for consumers is that
responsibilities for owning a corporation and running a service should be
separated from those of regulating it. He says: 'This really opens up
significant new territory for consumers because it makes it much clearer
where responsibility lies for running a service and setting the standards it
should reach.'
A corporation with a monopoly in a service, which also sets the standards of
service it has to meet, is unlikely to set standards as exacting as those
set by an independent regulator.
British Rail and the Department of Transport between them own, run and
regulate the railways. Consumers regard BR and the department as the chief
culprits responsible for poor quality, only to find that these two
organisations are also judge and jury of consumer complaints.
Rather than wait for privatisation, why not establish Ofpost, for the Post
Office, Oftube, for the London Underground or Ofrail for British Rail to
give consumers a much clearer voice in decision making.
After all, this would be a return to the roots of regulation. The US
Interstate Commerce Commission, set up in 1887 as the first modern
regulatory agency, was modelled on the British Regulation of Railways Act of
1873, a regulatory scheme which the House of Commons soon after declared to
be a failure. For modern regulators to avoid such a fate they will need to
be ready to reform themselves as well as the industries they regulate.
The first article about Britain's regulators appeared on Wednesday March 13.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Letter: Britain should heed Spain's proposal for Community
budget distribution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir MICHAEL FRANKLIN.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The British government might take the opportunity of Mr Felipe
Gonzalez's visit to London last week to think again about one aspect of its
European policy.
Spain has put high on its list of priorities for the current
intergovernmental conferences a change in the EC's financing arrangements to
ensure that the Community budget brings about adequate transfers from the
richer to the poorer member states. Such a concept has not endeared itself
to those in Britain who fear that it will only inflate EC spending still
further and that such transfers are unnecessary and wasteful.
No doubt much can and should be done to see that EC monies on regional and
social projects are properly used, but problems on this account do not
invalidate the argument for having a Community budget, whatever its size,
which is consciously redistributive. At present there are serious anomalies
with some of the richer EC member states being net beneficiaries.
If there was an override mechanism to make sure that the overall effect of
Community budget flows was as it ought to be - according to need and ability
to pay - there would be less need to distort the Community's individual
policies. In particular, countries both rich and poor which currently
benefit from the excessive expenditure on agricultural price support might
be less resistant to sensible reform of the Cap.
This in itself should commend the Spanish proposal to Britain. But there are
two other reasons. Since our GDP per head is around the EC average, we
should come out of a redistributive budget at least as well as under the
present arrangements. Second, since the present arrangements depend on a
special corrective mechanism negotiated with difficulty for Britain alone,
we should be much less exposed if they were replaced by something which was
really communautaire.

'At the beginning of my review, I stated that 1990 had been a difficult
year. For me, it was also a rewarding one.'
So says Mick Newmarch, chief executive of Prudential Corporation, writing in
his annual report for 1990 - a year in which, it may be recalled, the Pru's
pre-tax profits rose 9 per cent and his salary rose 43 per cent.

Woody Allen, the American comedian, writer and film director, may not seem
the most obvious name to associate with the Italian Co-op, one of the
country's biggest retailers with almost L8,000bn (Pounds 3.6bn) in sales.
But shooting for a series of five 45-second TV commercials written and
directed by Allen is due to start soon.
It is not quite the first time Allen, best known for his films of New York
life, is making a commercial. An earlier project for the Campari drinks
group never got off the ground owing to problems over the script.
The scripts for the Co-op's new ads have already been delivered, although
executives at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi in Italy, which has the Co-op account, are
sworn to secrecy as to their content.
However, word is that there is already some concern about the use of typical
Allen
characters drawn from the US east coast, such as the New York shrink, to
sell the fruits, vegetables and other foods promoted by the new ads.
Nevertheless, Italy's Co-op, which is both bigger and richer than most of
its European counterparts, is determined to go ahead, and may even try to
draw attention to its status-raising director by giving Allen an on-screen
credit at the end of each commercial.
The company is less keen to say how much he is being paid. Peter Falk, the
television detective 'Colombo', reportedly earned L700m for his Co-op ads
five years ago. Evidently, the company made the artistic Allen an offer he
couldn't refuse.

How easily great schemes can gang a-gley, especially when they're hatched by
the notoriously mother-tongue- bound British.
In discussions with the rest of Europe about economic and monetary union, UK
officials thought they'd hit on a wonderful idea for inching towards
agreement on a European central bank while keeping in British hands a goodly
portion of the country's gold and foreign currency reserves.
Under existing plans for union the UK's reserves would end up, along with
those of the other EC nations, in the coffers of the new central bank
instead of being locked away at the Bank of England.
Such a state of affairs would enrage Tory right-wingers, and make it harder
for the govern- ment to win parliament's backing for even a modest show of
UK support for Emu.
The officials' wheeze was to agree to the transfer of 'reserves' from
Britain to the new bank, but without specifying how much.
The plan foundered when the British side realised that the wording would
have to be translated into French - which insists on nouns having an
indefinite or definite article. Use of the prefix des, meaning 'some',
rather than the all-encompassing les, would have immediately given the game
away.

Tim Renton, Britain's arts minister and humble mortal, recently found
himself ushered into the presence of a God, blissfully unaware of the
protocol crisis which preceded the auspicious event.
One of Westminster's few true gentlemen and far better suited to being arts
supremo than Chief Whip, the Machiavellian assignment dumped on him by an
increasingly isolated Margaret Thatcher, Renton was heading for the Horniman
Museum to meet the Ooni of Ife, divine king of 15m Yoruba people in south
west Nigeria.
The legacy of a Victorian tea merchant, the Horniman collection embraces
artifacts and art from cultures and religious faiths around the world. Proud
owner of a stuffed walrus and its very own mummy, the museum has now added
an exhibition of Yoruba art, which Renton was invited to look over.
But the museum's big-wigs were unsure of the correct procedures to be
followed when a minister meets a god. After considerable anguish, it was
eventually decided that Renton need not kneel.
At the moment of their meeting, however, it was agreed that tom-toms would
sound - a salute considered sufficiently grand because the Ooni, it emerged,
is only a part-time god. Off-duty, the divinity is a commodities broker.

Vienna may conjure up strains of Strauss and romantic images of nights at
the opera. But it seems self-respecting Saudis, used to only the most
luxurious of life-styles, regard a posting to the Austrian capital as a
positive hardship.
Hence the tough job faced by the Saudi delegation to the Organisation of
Petroleum Exporting Countries in finding the right head for the cartel's
public relations department.
The lucky candidate is Mohammed Abdul-Aziz al-Sahlawi, who is reported to
have accepted only on condition that he also continues to draw his full
salary at home, where he is professor of economics at the King Fahd
University of Petroleum. Pecuniary wheeler-dealing apart, the appointment of
Sahlawi, a US-educated engineer, is a clear sign of Saudi Arabia's new
dominance within Opec.  This is the first time in 15 years that the world's
biggest oil exporter has put forward one of its own nationals for a senior
post inside the organisation.
The surprise decision also leaves a disgruntled Kemal Saiki, who has been
running the public relations side for the fractious oil producers for the
past year and had been promised the top job.
Alas, being Algerian, he's tarred by the Saudis with the same brush as
Opec's current president Sadek Boussena. Saudi Arabia is dissatisfied with
the way Boussena has managed Opec politics to meet his domestic agenda and
he will almost certainly be voted out of office in June.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Green hopes rise in a grey area: A new urgency in Brussels
to build an effective and coherent European Community environment policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, assembled the
chiefs of the EC's civil service in March to lambast them for lack of focus,
he alighted on the head of the environment directorate to make his point.
'I want an environment policy, not endless packages for migratory birds,' he
is quoted as saying by one of those on the receiving end of the
tongue-lashing.
Only weeks later he appears to have got one - a policy, moreover, which may
square two and a half of the three circles surrounding the Community's
environmental effort.
This has enabled Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, EC environment commissioner, to
claim that 'we have reached a turning point in EC environmental policy . . .
a point where the environment and the single market are on an equal
footing'.
The claim seems large. Yet already there are signs of more streamlined
decision-making and greater effort to frame policies for all EC members.
Eventually, Brussels could have a much stronger hand in setting the 'green'
agenda. Controversially, it wants economic growth kept within bounds set by
what the environment can stand. As one example, the Commission would like a
'green tax' on all forms of non-renewable energy, to curb consumption.
Another concern for companies is the Commission's plan to get them to report
annually on their effect on the environment. Under current thinking these
'environmental audits' for industry would mostly be voluntary. But they
would be compulsory for larger companies in high 'eco-risk' sectors such as
chemicals and steel.
The edge of EC environmental policy is at present blunted by:
the normal requirement for unanimous approval of legislation by the EC
Council of Ministers, which tends to pull proposed standards down to the
lowest common denominator;
the consequential tendency of the richer, 'northern' member states to press
ahead unilaterally with stricter measures, which threaten to fragment the
single market;
the failure of the Community as a whole to match rhetoric - and even formal
policy - with action, classically instanced by member states' inability to
agree on a site for the European Environment Agency (EEA) which they voted
to set up a year ago.
Mr Ripa di Meana's optimism will be borne out only if the Commission's new
environmental offensive progresses on all three of these fronts. Brussels
has advertised this new determination by asking the member states to make
the Treaty of Rome 'greener'. It has asked the inter-governmental conference
on political union, which is revising the treaty, to change the rules so
that environmental legislation is decided by qualified majority vote in the
Council - as most single market directives already are. This form of voting,
instead of unanimity, requires a weighted majority, with the largest member
states commanding the most votes.
The Commission also wants the treaty to commit the EC to 'sustainable
growth', and to require environmental criteria to be integrated into other
Community policies. 'Never before has the Commission so clearly stated that
we have to get equal status between the environment and growth - without
which growth itself is put at risk,' the green bespectacled environment
commissioner enthuses.
If endorsed by the inter-governmental conference, the proposed changes in
voting requirements could raise standards significantly for legislation on
the environment. In strict procedural terms, the unanimity rule is waived
only when the Council decides unanimously it will vote by majority. 'I doubt
whether Jonathan Swift at his best could have thought of that particular
formula,' snorts Mr Ken Collins, the Labour MEP who heads the influential
environment committee of the European Parliament.
One Commission official says a change in voting rules will achieve a 'middle
common denominator', whereby environment provisions will be less quickly
'overtaken by time, events and technological developments'. He cited the
Commission's most glowing recent success: tight controls on car and lorry
emissions pushed through in the past 10 months. The parliament cajoled the
Commission into setting high standards and presenting them to Council as the
'harmonisation' of national regulations.
This device exploits a grey area in the treaty as amended by the Single
European Act. To use the device the Commission must prove that the
environmental measure it proposes is dealing with distortion of competition.
Four out of nine pieces of law examined by environment ministers in March
passed this test.
But despite this advance, member state challenges to majority voting are
becoming more frequent. The Commission's lawyers and the European Court of
Justice, moreover, monitor use of single market procedures for environmental
measures.
The UK, for example, may well challenge the Commission's choice of majority
voting for its proposals to standardise landfill operations for waste
disposal. This case poses the dilemma acutely. The Commission feels certain
it could not win unanimity for a worthwhile law. Yet under current provision
for majority voting, member states can ignore or go far beyond what is
agreed - creating the vision was designed to iron out.
But the success of the vehicle emissions legislation which emerged under
this procedure has yielded an interim, more richly-textured device, which
the Commission has adopted as its new policy framework. Its goal is to
prevent the richer and greener EC members with stricter rules from
contributing to a 'two-speed' Europe.
The new framework aims to bridge an EC north-south divide, reining back
states such as Germany and Netherlands, which have tougher standards, and to
lash forward countries such as Spain and Portugal which see less need for,
and can less easily affordsuch standards.
From now on, the Commission proposes a two-stage approach, modelled on the
vehicles emissions legislation: a first, compulsory package of laws,
followed by parallel, more stringent targets for the Community as a whole to
aim at, but which individual member states can progress towards at their own
speed. Fiscal incentives can be used to speed up the obligatory standards
and - only after these have been achieved EC-wide - to bring forward the
tougher norms.
The intention is to end the chaotic proliferation of national incentives
which are threatening to undermine Brussels competition policy. Germany, for
instance, has tried unilaterally to introduce vehicle emission standards
beyond current EC policy through tax concessions on cars incorporating
advanced catalytic converters. This would give such cars a price advantage,
and possibly constitute a barrier to imports of cars falling below these
standards.
Just as important, if some member states were to follow their own green
path, the credibility of a common environmental policy would be shredded.
This would undermine the Commission's ability to enforce viable measures on
the EC as a whole.
But the success of the automotive package, appears to be encouraging more
aggressive thinking inside the Commission on how to achieve a balance of
incentives and disincentives for environmental ends.
No one would accuse the ebullient Italian commissioner himself of thinking
small. His most ambitious project is undoubtedly for a mixed carbon and
energy tax, in line with the EC's commitment last October to stabilise
carbon dioxide emissions at their 1990 level by 2000.
When an embryonic plan for a straight 'CO tax' leaked two years ago it was
derided as lunatic. 'Then, I was just caressing it,' Mr Ripa di Meana
recalls fondly, 'but now, we have won the right to discuss it.'
In improbable alliance with Mr Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, the conservative
energy commissioner from Portugal, Mr Ripa di Meana has developed a more
rounded proposal which the European Council is to report on by July. His own
deadline for action is 'the other 1992' - next April's world climate
conference in Brazil, where a convention to combat global warming is
supposed to be signed.
The plan - which the Commission may still water down  - has been refined to
keep the 12 together, and to emphasise competitive advantage.
The core idea is that while a levy on fossil fuels according to their carbon
content would provide the greatest incentive to reduce emissions, it would
fall most heavily on coal, then oil, and last, gas, while not touching
nuclear energy. This would have an uneven effect across the EC, penalising,
say, Spain, while rewarding France's extensive nuclear capacity.
But a CO levy with a tax on non-renewable energy sources would even out the
effect, and could, the Commission believes, be introduced in a fiscally
neutral way by member states. The risk of the Community not acting jointly
is, once again, that Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands will go ahead with
their own, potentially market-distorting plans.
The second emphasis is therefore to sell throughout the EC the merits of a
so-called 'no regrets strategy'. This means it should have clear
shorter-term benefits, competitive and environmental, to compensate for the
scientific uncertainty about the long-term effects of global warming.
Mr Jos Delbeke, senior economist in the Commission's environment directive,
has listed the benefits for the Centre for European Policy Studies
think-tank. These included improved energy efficiency and security;
diminished acid rain; more efficient transport policy, and relief of traffic
congestion (which the single market will exacerbate); a catalyst to industry
to bring on line new capital goods and technology which uses less energy and
fewer raw materials. 'Japan has a comparative advantage in terms of
energy-efficient equipment . . . and that is the market of the future,' Mr
Delbeke underlines; a fillip for greater harmonisation of fiscal policy; and
greater macroeconomic convergence within the EC through common transport and
energy policies.
Nice balance would be needed, with offsets to ensure no loss of
competitiveness, Mr Delbeke stresses. 'It is not the idea to create
deserts.'
Balance of a different sort - the 'you-scratch-my-back' variety  - has
prevented the EC from agreeing on a location for the European Environment
Agency. France wants a deal on the location of the EEA (Copenhagen and
Madrid are front-runners) to be made conditional on confirmation of
Strasbourg as the permanent home of the European Parliament.
Mr Ripa di Meana's anger at France's de facto veto is matched only by his
scorn at her partners' refusal to dirty their hands in the dispute. Without
the EEA, many other of his legislative ambitions will be stalled.
The agency's core job will be to gather accurate statistics on the EC
environment. But it is also the key to a storehouse of measures, including:
'eco-labelling', a plan to institute an awards system for
environment-friendly products; and plans to introduce annual environmental
audits for industry. In the absence of these measures, national labels
following different standards, and voluntary audits without guidelines
allowing comparison, are proliferating. The EEA is also vital for regular
updating of existing directives, taking in technological advances member
states might otherwise incorporate on their own.
Mr Ripa di Meana says he will shortly be publishing a report on the EEA
fiasco deliberately intended to embarrass the member states. 'To have here
blackmail - and that is the word to be used  - is not acceptable,' he
vituperates. Harsh words, but the environment will not be seen to be on the
same priority level as the 1992 programme until battles such as those over
the siting of the EEA are won.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Arts: Rudolf Serkin - Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rudolf Serkin died in Vermont on May 8, aged 88, and with his death the 20th
century has lost one of its greatest pianists. He was born in Bohemia in
1903 of Russian parents, studied in Vienna (where one of his composition
teachers was Schoenberg) and made his debut with the Vienna Symphony at the
age of 12.
It was a concert with the Busch Chamber Orchestra in Berlin in 1920, though,
that led to his enduring association with the Busch family. He became Adolf
Busch's recital partner in duos and trios, appeared regularly with the Busch
Quartet and married Adolf's daughter Irene in 1935; their son Peter, has
become a challenging pianist in his own right. In 1939 the Serkins emigrated
to the United States, where he was to become head of piano at the Curtis
Institute in Philadelphia, and in 1950 to start the Marlboro Music Festival
and School with Adolf and Hermann Busch.
While Serkin established his reputation as one of the most authoritative and
musically disciplined interpreters of the Viennese tradition, he was also
from his earliest days a superlative chamber musician, first within the
Busch dynasty but later with other distinguished groups such as the Budapest
Quartet.
He was never a flamboyant technician; his piano tone was always eloquent
rather than seductive. But he was a profound thinking musician who placed
his considerable powers strictly at the service of the music he respected so
deeply.
Though his programmes ranged into the dustier corners of the repertory,
including the piano works of Mendelssohn, Reger and Strauss, Serkin's art
was always centred upon the Viennese classics; his Mozart piano concertos
(he returned to them in his 80s for a last series of recordings with Abbado)
had limpid grace and lyrical strength, his Beethoven was searching, never
pedantic, his Schubert often starkly dramatic. Perhaps his accounts of the
Brahms concertos demonstrated his intellectual grasp most magnificently,
with their ability to encompass rhetorical grandeur and the most careful
introspection in a single dramatic sweep.
In his last years his performances were sometimes erratic, pared down to the
point of gruffness, but the dedication and self-effacing demeanour of his
playing remained. And at its best it could still sustain a tradition that
appears to us now as descended from a golden age, which had fashioned Serkin
into one of its peerless interpreters.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Arts: Off-Met opera, New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW PORTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The New York conservatories provide some of the city's happiest operatic
adventures. At the Mannes School, we have had Gluck's Paride ed Elena in an
enchanting performance. Paride was the third, and is the most beautiful, of
the three reform operas that Gluck and Calzabigi wrote for Vienna. And
unlike Orfeo and Alceste it was not revised and commercialised for Paris. In
these pages 28 years ago, I wrote with rapture of a Royal Manchester College
production with Ryland Davies and Anne Howells among the student performers.
If Paride has not captured the world's smaller stages, it may be because its
cast is five sopranos (Davies sang Paris an octave down), or because its
five acts trace but a single action, Helen's surrender to Paris's wooing.
But they trace it with such psychological subtleties  - the letters in
Ovid's Heroides are the source of the libretto - and with such musical
beauty that listeners remain spellbound. Paris lands in Sparta as a playboy,
but falls deeply and truly in love.
Like Orfeo, Paride is at once an opera about and a demonstration of music's
power to touch the heart. The long, harp-accompanied aria that Paris sings
in Act 3, hypnotically beautiful, begins the conquest of Helen's scruples;
by Act 5, although Pallas Athene warns the lovers that dreadful, destructive
war attends the surrender of reason and decency to emotion, and although
they understand the warning, erotic force proves irresistible. The opera,
despite its bright C-major ending, is a tragedy, both stirring and profound.
The score was given uncut (for the first time since 1770?). The performance,
in the salon of the Mannes School - once a convent refectory - was unstaged
(no decor, no dancers) but was enacted. It had been prepared and was
conducted by Will Crutchfield, who had worked long with his student singers,
inspiring them with a feeling for words, tone, sense, and style that made
the performance moving and memorable. The Gluckian miracle of poise and
formality united with keen, direct emotional expression was achieved.
Natalie Arduino was Paris, Laura Danehower was Helen, and Elizabeth Wiley
was Cupid. The opera was sung in Italian.
The Juilliard Opera Center gave us a Verdi Falstaff, conducted by Julius
Rudel, that was not intolerable but had nothing special to offer. The
Juilliard drama students put on a happy Happy End that was exciting from
start to finish. The Salvation Army libretto - lyrics by Brecht, 'book' by
Elisabeth Hauptmann, English adaptation by Michael Feingold - may be
ramshackle, but Weill's songs are stunning and stirring. And the drama
students, produced by Moni Yakim, put the piece across with irresistible
verse and adresse. It was an athletic, very 'physical' production. I hope
the Falstaff cast - singing dummies, most of them - saw it, and resolved to
'register' for the instruction in 'body communication' and in getting words
across. Deborah Lapidus conducted.
At the Fashion Institute of Technology, Stephen Sondheim's Into the Woods
was revived. The FIT institutional auditorium is a drear place. Into the
Woods has its points, but it is a feeble score, and at FIT patchy, murky,
word-killing amplification of the singers, and coarse balance between the
orchestra and the stage, obscured the wit of the words and dulled the zest
of the young performers. Amplification, like surtitling, is evidently here
to stay, but let it be technically competent.
Let two other productions, not student, round off the picture of off-Met New
York opera. L'Opera Francais de New York offered a delectable double bill in
Florence Gould Hall - an elegant little theatre tucked deep beneath a
commercial building on Madison Avenue. They were Gretry's Les Deux Avares
and Bizet's Le Docteur Miracle. The Gretry is OK; the Bizet - London first
saw it in the theatre of Londonderry House, now demolished, with an
unforgettable performance by Johanna Peters - is a miniature masterpiece.
Yves Abel conducted it as such, and Sharon Azraeli was a winning heroine.
These were concert performances, but a staged Iphigenie en Tauride is
promised next.
Amato Opera plays in a down-town garage converted into a cosy little gem of
a tiny opera house where everything tells. Here many singers now famous -
Mignon Dunn, George Shirley, Neil Shicoff  - made early appearances. And
here Verdi's I due Foscari has been playing - for eight performances, each
of them with a different cast. Anthony Amato, the conductor and producer of
the enterprise, is an instinctual genius, a born interpreter of 19th-century
Italian opera. He gets the tempi, the rubato and the accommodations to the
strengths and the failings of the particular singers exactly right. He
should surely be conducting at the Met. And in Richard Cerullo he has a
designer who works wonders on a shoestring and clothes 19th-century operas
in apt, attractive scenery.
The Due Foscari I heard was not well sung; I doubt whether any of its
performers will go on to achieve Met fame. But it was sung with a
communicativeness that brought the opera to life. (Whereas in grander, more
pretentious performances in huge houses operas often die.) A skeleton
representation of Verdi's orchestra - piano filling in what was missing -
played the score. But the clarinet was eloquent, and the music came across
and told, keenly.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Arts: Pop is the tops - Sponsorship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What are we to make of the current state of arts sponsorship? On the one
hand a bank cancelled a party to celebrate a sponsorship and tried to sell
on the deal, at a discount, because it did not want to be associated with
supporting an arts event while making staff redundant; on the other hand
Glyndebourne has raised over Pounds 20m from business inside a year to
finance its new opera house.
The bank is being over-cautious, and companies are helping Glyndebourne not
so much for love of opera but because they want the pay-off - a 20 year
guarantee of access to Glyndebourne tickets for entertainment purposes. The
money helps the arts but via the dubious route of corporate hospitality, and
it doubtless comes from a different budget.
Remarkably few sponsorships have been cancelled by the recession - as yet.
The problems will arise next year when current commitments lapse and talks
on renewal stall. But chief executives are already trying to cut back on
sponsorship where feasible. If the London City Ballet gives up next month
(and there are reports that, despite being promised an Arts Council grant
for 1992-93, the management is determined to stop dancing) the Pounds
800,000 committed by business to the LCB will not be switched to other arts
companies but disappear into corporate funds. That, at least, is the line
taken by one backer, Barclays Bank.
So far the Japanese continue to support the arts and the 1991 Japan Festival
in the UK has raised Pounds 15m from business. The oil companies are still
committed and last month Mobil announced another Pounds 125,000 sponsorship,
the Greensight Project, which develops educational packs for schools,
exploring the relationships between industry and the environment through the
making of video programmes.
But the odds must be against the renewal of such major sponsorships as the
Prudential Awards and Shell-Bafta when these Pounds 1m plus projects draw to
a close within the next 12 months. The worst is yet to come.
The Royal Academy is probably more adept than any other arts organisation at
attracting sponsorship. It has to be; it receives no government aid. But
even the RA is rather impressed with the Pounds 600,000 guarantee against
loss it has conjured up at the last moment for its Pop Art Show, opening on
September 13. Not only is this its biggest ever lifebelt but it is a record
sponsorship for any art show in the UK.
The bulk of the money, Pounds 500,000, comes from Mercury Communications,
with the rest from The Independent. The show, the first major survey of Pop
Art for over 20 years, is so expensive to put on because of its size - both
in the number of pictures that need to be transported, over 200, and the
size of some of them.
To prove it has no favourites the Pop Art Show will still be running when an
exhibition of prints by the Japanese artist Hokusai opens in November -
sponsored by Mercury's rival, British Telecom.
Before Pop there are the Fauves, opening in June and backed by Ford. At the
same time the RA will unveil its new look galleries, named after the Sackler
family which has given over Pounds 1m for the facelift. The refurbished
galleries provide the chance of a re-hang of the RA's own over-looked art
collection, paid for by Texaco, which is becoming a force in arts
sponsorship.
On October 4 Chicago opens its new public library, a nine storey
neo-classical monolith which occupies a whole down town block. This major
event, the culmination of a 70 year campaign, will be celebrated with a week
of junketings, thanks to WH Smith which is contributing Dollars 300,000 to
pay for the ceremonies.
This is not unthinking philanthropy on the part of the UK's leading
bookseller. WH Smith began trading in the US in 1985 and is a major presence
in the massive O'Hare Airport in Chicago where it operates 21 shops. It also
functions at five hotels in the city. Already a big name among the
travelling public in the Midwest, WH Smith is keen to make friends with more
sedentary readers.
British Gas may lack a structure to its arts sponsorships, but no one can
fault its variety. On April 30 it announced the winners of the first Arts
Council/British Gas 'Working for Cities' Awards, and the next night it
backed the Toronto Symphony Orchestra's Barbican concert.
'Working for Cities' is about the role of the arts in urban regeneration and
the main winners were: for art in public places - the Broadgate in London;
for people - Neville Campbell of Phoenix Dance in Leeds; for buildings - Tic
Toc in Coventry; for events  - the NGR 90 Festival at Gateshead; for
partnership - Fish Quay, North Tyneside; in the pipeline - Riverfront
Promenade, Newport.
The Barbican concert was in complete contrast - old fashioned patronage and
corporate hospitality because British Gas has bought Consumer Gas of Ontario
and wants to make friends in Canada.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Arts: Tosca - Covent Garden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At regular intervals, for the sake of operatic health and decency, it is
proper to recall Joseph Kerman's stern dictum: 'Tosca, that shabby little
shocker, is no doubt admired nowadays mostly in the gallery.' When the
melodramatic grip fails, what we discover is a showman carefully tormenting
clockwork mice. Saturday's revival at the Royal Opera stayed more or less
afloat on waves of generous response from the stalls, rather than the
gallery. For this was a performance in the annual Midland Bank Proms week -
probably the best thing to have happened to Covent Garden since the Second
World War - and un-jaded enthusiasm is always on tap.
This was what used to be the Zeffirelli production, now staged by John Cox
in the handsome old designs of Mongiardino and Escoffier (with sponsorship
by Bankers Trust Company). Rather less strikingly lit than before, if memory
serves, and certainly less persuasively enacted, but no one person is to
blame. What we have is a curdled international brew. No Italians, but
ultra-professional American tenor and bass who have to hold their own
against an admired German soprano and a distinguished French conductor,
neither of them born to do anything at all with Puccini.
To the luckless Cavaradossi, Neil Shicoff brings his customary high
definition and reckless energy, firing top notes into the house like laser
beams. There were places where he and the conductor Michel Plasson were not
on the same wave-length (even in 'E lucevan le stelle'). Samuel Ramey's
Scarpia, in gleaming black voice, preens and looms - utterly faithful to the
words, which come up in the English surtitles with scarifying grossness. Not
for the first time, I thought that Ramey was over-painting the sleek menace
which his physiognomy and stature already guarantee; even Scarpia needs some
down-to-earth, human touches.
There is a good, hunted Angelotti from Stephen Gadd, and Eric Garrett
repeats his bouncing, twinkling Sacristan. (It is a horrid role; a bit of
Verdi's Fra Melitone and some echoes of Wagner's David, in aid of nothing
but making a crude contrast with the desperation of the young rebels.) For
the unseen Shepherd Boy, Daniel Ison's treble has a nice, natural plangency.
That leaves Hildegard Behrens, whose great virtues in the German repertoire
are well recognised. As Tosca, her Italian is almost completely
unintelligible (except the spoken lines, which she emits in a weird,
slow-motion growl); so is her phrasing, which betrays not a trace of feeling
for Puccini's elegantly drooping curves. In the slow romantic passages - and
in much music which should not be slow at all - Plasson was downright
sluggish (the beginning of Act 3 seemed interminable), cruelly exposing the
threadbare timbre of the Behrens middle register.
It was a blessing that she remained bright and secure at the top; but 'Vissi
d'arte', done as a tear-wracked effusion, was a fearsome exercise in
non-style. Her dramatic outbursts were generally safer, with a strong suit
in sheer physical revulsion against Scarpia's blandishments. Whether with
Scarpia or with Cavaradossi, however, she seemed curiously insulated; nobody
really played to anybody else. We were being treated to independent solo
turns - which do not add up to an effective Tosca.
Expert pacing of the score would have been a help, and many an expert hack
could have supplied it. Plasson is no hack, and his civilised hand is so
sure in the French repertoire it was astonishing to hear this opera limping
cautiously along, bland and fuzzy in attack. In the first act only the frank
scherzo-music had any spark; the playful and mischievous moments which need
to enliven Tosca's scene with her lover came out like squeezed toothpaste.
By contrast, the climaxes were often raw and overblown. And for the
ironically twisted execution-march Plasson chose a funereal tempo which left
it dead.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Economics: Market to focus on likely RPI fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS a lot for the market to focus on in the UK, with the performance of
the Conservatives in Thursday's parliamentary by-election in Monmouth coming
under scrutiny before the release of the retail prices index the following
day.
Well-highlighted by Treasury ministers has been the likely fall in the RPI
on Friday to around 6.2 per cent in April from March's 8.2 per cent.
The Treasury has twice used a fall in the RPI as a trigger point for a 1/2
 percentage point cut in the bank base rate. The question this week will be
whether the government wants to relax monetary policy ahead of Thursday's
vote or at the time of a perceived easing in inflationary pressures.
However, the market was warned last week that underlying inflation remained
stubborn. Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, said
the fall would reveal no more than the effect of last year's imposition of
the community charge dropping out of the 12-month figures, aided by recent
interest-rate reductions. Whatever the Conservatives' electoral plans, the
money market expects a  1/2 point cut in interest rates to 11 1/2 per cent
next week. Unemployment figures are set to show another very steep rise
after March's record jump of 113,000.
In the US, expectation of the Federal Reserve easing interest rates again
could mount. While a small rise in tomorrow's consumer prices index is
possible, further weakness in retail sales and industrial production will be
evident.
Other notable events and statistics, with market forecasts from MMS
International, the financial research company, in brackets include:
Today: UK, credit business for March (Pounds 125m) and final retail sales
(3.7 per cent). Canada, housing starts for April. Germany, wholesale prices
in-dex for April. Basle, Bank of International Settlements meeting.
Tomorrow: US, consumer prices index (0.2 per cent), retail sales (0.4 per
cent), industrial production (0.0 per cent), capacity utilisation for April
(78.6 per cent), Federal Open Markets Committee. Japan, machinery orders for
April. UK, provisional producer prices indices for April (input, 0.8 per
cent, output up 0.9 per cent to an annual 6.1 per cent), acquisitions and
mergers, first quarter, capital issues and redemptions.
Wednesday: US, business inventories for March (0.5 per cent), Canada,
important wage settlements. Australia, first quarter consumer price index
(0.4 per cent).
Thursday: UK, labour market statistics, provisional unemployment (up 85,000)
and unfilled vacancies for April, provisional average earnings indices for
March (9.25 per cent), productivity and unit wage costs (11.5 per cent),
provisional figures of vehicle production, index of output of the production
industries for March (manufacturing down 0.9 per cent, ind. prod down 0.7
per cent), capital expenditure by the manufacturing industries, financing of
the public sector borrowing requirement for the first quarter, monetary
statistics. Bank of England quarterly bulletin. Germany, Bundesbank meeting.
US, money supply, initial claims.
Friday: UK, public sector borrowing requirement for April (Pounds 2.75bn),
retail prices index and tax and price index for April (1.1 per cent). US,
merchandise trade for March (down Dollars 5.5bn).

FT  13 MAY 91 / Trials of setting a date in court: Delays surrounding the
Guinness case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE second trial arising out of the Guinness affair, which had been
scheduled to start last week, seems unlikely to begin before October.
Earlier dates are still being mooted, but there is a growing feeling that,
because of outstanding appeals and the approach of the season when witnesses
and judges like to go on holiday, the autumn is the most realistic prospect
for the start of the trial.
Mr Roger Seelig, former corporate finance director at Morgan Grenfell, and
Lord Spens, former director of corporate finance at Henry Ansbacher, are due
to stand trial accused of involvement in an unlawful share support operation
mounted by Guinness in 1986 during its bitterly-fought takeover battle with
the Argyll supermarket group for Distillers, the Scottish drinks group.
After several postponements the case, which is expected to last between
three and four months, had been scheduled to get under way at Southwark
Crown Court ion London last Tuesday. However, because of appeals by Mr
Seelig and Lord Spens against pre-trial rulings by Mr Justice Henry, and
appeals by three of those convicted in the first Guinness trial last year,
that fixture was not met and further delays became inevitable.
Mr Seelig and Lord Spens want to challenge in the House of Lords the Court
of Appeal's rejection of their appeal against Mr Justice Henry's ruling that
evidence they gave to Department of Trade and Industry inspectors
investigating Guinness can be used by the prosecution at the trial.
The two men argue that the inspectors should have cautioned them against
self-incrimination and that the failure to caution makes it unfair for their
evidence to be used at the trial.
It is an issue which is central to current concern about the powers given to
those investigating fraud and the absence of a right to silence for those
suspected of white-collar crimes.
A prerequisite for an appeal to the Lords is for the Appeal Court to certify
that the case raises a question of law of general public importance, which
it will be asked to do this week. If that hurdle is surmounted the court
will either give leave to appeal or tell Mr Seelig and Lord Spens they must
seek leave direct from the Law Lords.
Unless there are grounds for expedition, the time lapse between a Lords
appeal being lodged and heard is at least six months, which would suggest a
hearing date no earlier than November.
Even if expedited, an appeal lodged this month would be unlikely to come on
before October, because of the legal summer vacation in August and
September. Given that the Law Lords' rulings are not normally handed down
until four to six weeks after a hearing, the trial date could well be pushed
back towards the end of the year.
Mr Seelig and Lord Spens have waited more than three years to come before a
jury, Mr Seelig having been arrested on October 15 1987 and Lord Spens on
March 10 1988.
The prosecution of the seven men originally charged in the Guinness affair
was transferred from Bow Street magistrates court to Southwark Crown Court
in November 1988, when it was expected that the trial would begin the
following summer. By June 1989 the date had been moved to the following
January. In October 1989 Mr Justice Henry decided on split trials, with Mr
Ernest Saunders, the former Guinness chairman and chief executive, in both,
and with Mr Seelig, Lord Spens and Mr David Mayhew, senior corporate finance
partner of Cazenove &amp; Co, the stockbrokers, alongside him in the dock in the
second trial.
When the first trial began in mid-February last year it was anticipated that
the second would start the following October. When Guinness One ended in
late August, however, Guinness Two was pushed back to January 14.
Mr Saunders, who had been convicted on all but one of the charges he had
faced in the first trial, was dropped from the second.
Shortly before Christmas the second trial was split, hiving off Mr Mayhew to
be tried in Guinness Three.
Since the beginning of this year legal arguments and appeals, coupled with
Lord Spens' new lawyers' need for more time to prepare his defence, have
resulted in further postponements.
Originally both defendants were represented by QCs, junior barristers and
solicitors. In April 1989 Lord Spens announced that he could no longer
afford the mounting legal costs and was dropping his lawyers.
Last November he was granted legal aid, however, and will be defended at the
trial by two junior barristers and solicitors.
Last year Mr Seelig also decided he could no longer afford legal
representation and has since conducted his own defence.
The two men are jointly charged under section 13 of the Prevention of Fraud
(Investments) Act with conspiring to induce Distillers shareholders to
exchange their holdings for shares in Guinness by the dishonest concealment
of material facts.
Mr Seelig alone faces a similar charge under the same act, as well as two
charges of false accounting. Lord Spens is charged with one false-accounting
offence.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Financial Times Reporter
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday confirmed its plan for a National Film Commission
to attract foreign investment in the film industry.
The plan, first mooted last June by Mrs Margaret Thatcher, then prime
minister, was outlined by Lord Hesketh, minister responsible for the film
industry, at the 44th international film festival in Cannes. It follows the
announcement of a Pounds 5m package to help UK film makers set up
co-production with their more subsidised continental counterparts.
The commission will be funded by the Department of Trade and Industry with a
budget of Pounds 3.5m spread over four years. Mr Sydney Samuelson, the
chairman of Samuelsons, international film production company, has been
appointed the first national film commissioner.
The role of the commission will include giving advice on taxation schemes,
work permits and location schedules.
The measures have been criticised by some film makers and the Labour party
as insufficient because they do not include special tax incentives.
The ailing UK film industry has been pressing for quicker write-offs,
reduction of the withholding tax on foreign actors and changes to make the
Business Expansion Scheme more suitable to finance feature films.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is facing renewed controversy over its plans to privatise
Northern Ireland's electricity supply industry amid reports that the chief
executive of Northern Ireland Electricity, Mr Anthony Hadfield, is to be
removed by his own board.
NIE yesterday denied a report that Mr Hadfield had been sacked. It would not
comment on a separate report that Mr Hadfield's three-year contract would
not be renewed when it expires in July.
However Mr Kevin McNamara, Labour's Northern Ireland spokesman, said last
night that according to reliable information he had received, a decision was
taken 10 days ago by NIE's board.
Mr McNamara, with other Northern Ireland MPs, has publicly attacked the
government's decision to break up and privatise NIE, the public utility
which has a virtual monopoly in the province.
Mr Hadfield, who is also deputy NIE chairman, was expected to play an
important role in the privatisation process. According to some MPs, NIE
managers and senior trade union officials his removal from the board could
put a question mark over the future of the government's plans.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Constructing defences against terrorist attacks: A company
in County Londonderry that refuses to give in to IRA intimidation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RESILIENT is a word often used to describe the people of Northern Ireland.
In spite of all the killings and bombings of the past 20 years the
province's population shows determination to carry on with normal life.
Mr John Henry is an example. He runs one of Northern Ireland's biggest
construction companies, in Magherafelt, County Londonderry. It is much like
any other large builder's yard, bustling with trucks, but the security
checks, the vehicles in the company car park with bullet-proof windows and
the surveillance cameras tell a different story.
Mr Henry's privately run Henry Bros is the main company in Northern Ireland
carrying out construction work for the security forces - the army and the
Royal Ulster Constabulary. It is a very risky business. The IRA describes
those who carry out such work as 'legitimate targets'.
Mr Henry says: 'The IRA always comes for us. Unlike other companies, we see
no reason to hide what we do.'
The price for such openness has been high. In the past four years alone
several people who were associated with the company, including Mr Henry's
brother, have been murdered by the IRA.
Company drivers have been shot at and the Henry Bros premises have been
attacked with car bombs and mortars. In 1986 a manager at the Magherafelt
plant was shot by the IRA as he sat in his car. The IRA had mistaken him for
Mr Henry.
Eighteen months ago a supplier to the company - a cousin of Mr Henry's wife
 -was blown up in his car.
Earlier this year the IRA abducted a company employee and forced him to
drive a 'proxy bomb' to a nearby army base. The employee was lucky enough to
escape before the massive bomb exploded.
Mr Henry and many of his employees endure a besieged existence. Mr Henry is
under constant police guard and he drives an armour-plated car. His company
yard and his house are kept under constant surveillance.
A quietly spoken, genial man, Mr Henry feels the pressure. 'It's when I go
to Scotland or away somewhere that I realise just what it's like to relax.
Here you can't let down your guard for one second.'
Mr Henry, a Protestant, started his company in the mid 1970s. He was once in
partnership with two Roman Catholics, but they sold out after IRA
intimidation.
Most of Mr Henry's 600 employees are Protestant. He says IRA intimidation
prevents Catholics from joining the company.
There have been times when Mr Henry has felt like giving up. One of his
murdered brother's sons became involved with Protestant paramilitaries and
is now serving a 12-year jail sentence. Last year one of Mr Henry's own sons
was killed in an industrial accident.
'My family urge me to carry on. We have lost family members and employees,
but we are also in the business of saving lives,' he says.
Henry Bros builds and installs heavily reinforced steel and concrete
structures to protect police stations and army posts, as well as
bullet-proof windows and blast-proof doors for government offices and
residences of senior officials.
The company does much of its own research and collaborates with a company in
Germany which specialises in counter terrorism and security.
Army observation posts, called 'sangers', are built at the Magherafelt
plant. The walls of the sangers consist of two layers of inch-thick steel
sandwiching slabs of concrete.
'You always have to think about what the IRA will come up with next,' says
Mr Henry. 'Now they are using horizontally launched mortars which can even
pierce one of these sangers.'
Henry Bros' business involves high risk, but it is also profitable. Five
years ago company turnover was Pounds 5m. Last year it was Pounds 22m.
The company has been forced into being as self-sufficient as possible.
Three years ago the IRA sent cards to 30 of Henry Bros' leading suppliers,
saying that if they continued selling goods to the company, funerals would
follow.
'It had great effect. All our big suppliers refused to do business with us.
We felt betrayed. We even had to start buying cement from Poland instead of
locally,' Mr Henry says.
'If all the energy and skills we put into this business could instead be
concentrated on exports, Northern Ireland could achieve a great deal,' he
points out. Henry Bros is hoping for export orders - for its bullet-proof
windows.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Sunday trading appeal to Law Lords today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE and JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONG legal battle over Sunday trading in England and Wales will enter
its final stage today when the Law Lords begin hearing an appeal by B&amp;Q, the
do-it-yourself chain, which will determine whether the Sunday trading laws
are incompatible with European law.
B&amp;Q is appealing against a ruling by Mr Justice Hoffmann in the High Court
last July that the 1950 Shops Act, which governs Sunday trading, does not
contravene the free-trade principles of European Community law.
The case concerns High Court injunctions granted to two councils banning B&amp;Q
from opening its stores at Norwich and Stoke on Trent on Sundays.
The Shops Act makes local authorities the prosecuting bodies for breaches of
the law. As a result enforcement is patchy across the country. Some councils
pursue any breach of the law while others turn a blind eye.
The maximum penalty for Sunday trading is a Pounds 1,000 fine for any one
store on any one Sunday. Local authorities can also seek High Court
injunctions to prevent breaches of the Shops Act.
Because some stores can make as much as Pounds 500,000 profit a year from
opening on Sundays, the Pounds 1,000 penalty has not proved an effective
deterrent. Local authorities have turned increasingly to injunctions as the
best way of banning Sunday trading over the past two years.
Two weeks ago, however, the effectiveness of these injunctions was thrown
into doubt by a High Court ruling that they should not be granted to local
authorities unless they were prepared to give cross-undertakings to the
court that if they eventually lost their case they would compensate the
stores for any financial losses resulting from enforced Sunday closure.
Council lawyers say because of the potential financial risks involved in
giving cross-undertakings this decision makes the Sunday trading laws
virtually unenforceable.
Last week, for example, Texas Homecare, the DIY chain run by the Ladbroke
Group, raised the pressure on six local authorities by stating that they
could face a potential claim for damages in excess of Pounds 150,000 per
year for each store where Texas had given cross-undertakings not to trade.
The DIY chain asked the authorities to confirm that such an amount had been
reserved in their budgets.
B&amp;Q will argue before the Law Lords that the Shops Act is incompatible with
Article 30 of the Treaty of Rome, which prevents quantitative restrictions
on imports between member states of the EC.
Retailers claim that the Sunday trading ban reduces their turnover and
results in fewer orders for goods from suppliers in other member states,
thereby indirectly restricting the level of imports into the UK from those
states.
The issue has already been referred once to the European Court. In November
1989 the Court ruled the Shops Act would not be compatible with Article 30
unless the Sunday trading ban had an objective regarded as justified in EC
law and the effect on trade caused by the measure did not exceed that
necessary to obtain that objective.
This left the UK courts with considerable discretion which has only
succeeded in increasing the confusion surrounding the Sunday trading laws.
Both the Home Office and the British Retailers' Association (BRA) have
launched separate initiatives to try to establish common ground between the
two sides.

FT  13 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Breakdown in trust seen at British
Rail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRICT financial constraints on British Rail's managers have led to a
breakdown in trust between them and local union officials, according to a
study. It says the constraints have prevented BR from replacing its
traditional style of industrial relations with improved consultation.
The study of attitudes among local representatives of the Aslef train
drivers' union found that most believed managers were more likely to breach
locally-negotiated agreements at the end of the 1980s than at the beginning
of that decade.
The survey of 181 union representatives on local departmental committees at
train depots found a decline in contact between union leaders and local BR
managers, partly because of new management structures. The committees set
working conditions such as rosters. The survey found little evidence that BR
was developing forms of consultation with individuals to replace this
weakening of traditional union mechanisms. Consultation was being 'squeezed
out' by pressures of time and financial constraints.
The RMT rail union is planning an industrial action ballot on what BR says
is a final pay offer of 7 per cent. Aslef and the TSSA white-collar union
are seeking arbitration on the offer through the Railway Staffs National
Tribunal.
The unpublished study by Mr Andrew Pendleton, an industrial-relations
lecturer at the University of Bradford, found a decline in the commitment to
'constitutionalism' which has marked industrial relations at BR.
BR was prevented from implementing a reform of its union consultation
structures in 1989 by a series of one-day strikes by rail unions. It has yet
to make fresh proposals for the devolving of pay bargaining to match its
corporate structure.
The study found that the proportion of union representatives who thought
managers could be relied on to observe agreements all or most of the time
had dropped from 81 per cent in 1980 to 54 per cent in the summer of 1989.
Mr Pendleton says the impression is less of 'an aggressive, confident
management decisively removing or ignoring those agreements that stand in
their way' than of managers reacting in an ad hoc manner to intense
budgetary pressures. 'The overriding impression is one of managers under
pressure, caught between the imperative of cost reduction and the
constitutionalism of their subordinates, seeking room for manoeuvre in
day-to-day depot management.'

FT  13 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Most tenders from councils won by
their own workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOCAL authorities' in-house labour forces have overwhelmingly held their own
against the private sector under government compulsory competitive
tendering, according to an advisory body survey.
The survey shows that in-house workforces, known as direct-labour
organisations, in England and Wales have won 69.7 per cent of 2,558
contracts in the first four rounds of compulsory tendering. Contracts won
in-house represent 84.3 per cent of the total value of contracts on offer.
Councils have been obliged by law since 1989 to put out to tender refuse
collection, street and building cleaning, catering, vehicle maintenance and
ground maintenance. Most contracts are for five years and councils are
generally bound to accept the lowest tender.
The survey was conducted by the Local Government Management Board, the
national body which advises local authorities on training, pay and
conditions, and management. It shows wide variations between different
services.
Refuse collection and ground maintenance face the greatest competition, with
an average of 3.4 tenders per contract. Only 10 per cent of
refuse-collection contracts were won without competition. Catering in
schools and social service departments drew an average of only 1.2 tenders
per contract, with 73 per cent of them won without competition.
There are marked regional variations, which correspond closely to councils'
political control. In-house labour has won all refuse-collection contracts
in Labour-dominated Wales and Yorkshire and Humberside and has been very
successful in the West Midlands.
In London only 58 per cent of contracts have gone in-house, and fewer than
two thirds have done so in the Tory-inclined south-east and East Anglia.
Contracts lost by councils' direct labour forces have almost all gone to the
private sector. There have been few management buy-outs.

FT  13 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Team talks deadlock at Royal Mail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEGOTIATIONS between management and unions on a new framework for industrial
relations at Royal Mail, the letters arm of the Post Office, have broken
down over proposals for team working.
This latest row comes after a decision by the Union of Communication
Workers, the main Post Office union, to ballot counter and clerical staff,
who work for the Post Office's Counters subsidiary, over a 6.8 per cent pay
offer. Mr Alan Tuffin, general sec-retary of the union, has described the
offer as 'inadequate'.
Royal Mail has wanted to introduce team working into its sorting and
delivery activities for some time but failed in its attempt to link the
issue to pay during last year's annual negotiations.
It became clear from a heated debate yesterday at the union's annual
conference in Blackpool that any renewed attempts to push through the
proposals as part of this year's pay talks in September could provoke
industrial action.
Agreement was reached with the UCW last year for a joint review, outside the
wage talks, of four issues. The issues are: productivity; automation; team
working; and a new framework for industrial relations to fit in with the
restructuring of the business.
It is planned to replace the 64 divisional districts early next year with
nine independent business centres.
Discussions on the new framework, as well as the team working proposals,
have run into trouble because of UCW objections to, in particular, the role
of team leaders.
The union has refused to accept that team leaders should have the power to
discipline team members. The UCW also fears that particular references to
team working in Royal Mail proposals for the new industrial relations
framework will undermine the shopfloor role of the union.
The management states in a document setting out the plan: 'Team members will
be able to express any concerns they may have either individually or jointly
to their team leader or team manager. In the first instance issues will
normally be discussed with the team leader, who will be responsible for . .
. identifying ideas and opportunities for further improvement.'
The Post Office said last night that the review was 'fundamental to future
working relations with the unions, and the direction we need to take to meet
changing customer needs'.

FT  13 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Small businesses still in recession,
says CBI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S small businesses are still in the middle of a deep recession, with
output plunging more quickly than at any time in the last decade, according
to the Confederation of British Industry.
The CBI says that a fall in orders between January and the end of April
means that three-quarters of small businesses are now working below
capacity. Manufacturers were expecting a decline in output early in the
year, but the downturn was more severe than anticipated.
Most companies say they expect the rate of deterioration in business to
moderate during the next few months, echoing the CBI's most recent quarterly
trends survey.
Mr Tom O'Connor, chairman of the CBI's smaller firms council, said the
latest survey confirmed that business was 'bumping along the bottom', with
recovery some way off.
The report, based on a survey of nearly 750 companies with fewer than 200
employees and conducted in early April, found that businesses were
experiencing difficulty in raising their prices.

FT  13 MAY 91 / London is top centre for foreign share deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of England has confirmed the London Stock Exchange as the biggest
foreign equity market in the world. Reforms introduced in most continental
European bourses - in the Netherlands, Germany, France and Switzerland -
have not yet threatened its dominant position.
The Bank's Quarterly Bulletin reports that London, third largest overall
last year with equity turnover totalling Pounds 305bn (sales only), now
accounts for more than two thirds of reported trading of equities outside
their country of origin.
'Overall,' it says, 'London has been successful in attracting trading of
foreign, particularly European, equities because of its historically open
capital market and its low costs compared with other exchanges.'
Accurate data on foreign equity trading in London became available only in
February 1990.
This followed the full introduction of Sequal, the London Stock Exchange's
trade reporting and confirmation system for stocks quoted on Seaq
International, the exchange's screen-based professional market for trading
foreign equities.
The data reveal that foreign equity trading (Pounds 150bn, sales only, in
1990) accounted for just under half of total turnover on the London Stock
Exchange last year. This compares with foreign business of Pounds 4.3bn for
Frankfurt and Pounds 2.5bn for Paris.
Figures for the New York Stock Exchange, the next biggest foreign equity
market, are not generally available, but in the first quarter of 1990 it was
estimated that foreign equity turnover was only 25 per cent of that in
London. Tokyo came third last year, a long way behind with Pounds 7.3bn.
Japanese stocks took the largest share of London's foreign equity turnover
in 1990, accounting for just over a quarter of the total. German shares were
also heavily traded, accounting for about 23 per cent. Other European shares
contributed most of the remainder.
The Bank concludes that trading costs are low in London and that London's
trading structure, with market makers taking positions between buyers and
sellers, provides superior liquidity for large wholesale trades.
'In the current liberal capital environment,' the Bank says, 'trading will
tend to move to where market conditions are favourable.'

FT  13 MAY 91 / Tories plan VAT rise says Smith: Increase in rate to 22 per
cent said to be on taxation 'hidden agenda'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR WENT on the offensive over tax and spending policy yesterday by
raising the spectre of a Tory 'hidden agenda' to increase value added tax
should the Conservatives be returned to office after a general election.
In an assault on the Tories' record, Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor,
accused the government of 'sheer hypocrisy' in claiming to have lowered
taxation when the total tax burden, taking in National Insurance and VAT,
had risen from 34.75 per cent in 1978-79 to 37.75 per cent in 1990-91.
Defending the government's achievements, Mr David Mellor, the chief
secretary to the Treasury, once again asked how Labour would raise public
spending by Pounds 20bn without increasing taxes.
The new skirmishing over taxation came as all the parties were manoeuvring
for maximum advantage before Thursday's by-election in Monmouth, where the
Tories are defending a 9,000 majority.
In spite of the efforts of Tory leaders to stamp out speculation over a June
general election some Conservatives still believe a good result in the seat
might bolster the case for an early poll.
Prior to a week-long programme of speeches to businessmen in Manchester,
Leeds and Birmingham, Mr Smith raised the VAT issue in his address to the
Banking, Insurance and Finance Union in Blackpool.
He warned that if Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, were to fulfil his
promise to lower basic tax rates to 20p in the pound he would either have to
cut public spending or shift the burden to another tax, probably VAT.
Labour has calculated that to fund a 5p cut in basic rate income tax the
Tories would have to increase VAT from 17.5 per cent to 22 per cent.
Officials pointed out that the Tories had shifted the tax burden to indirect
taxation when Sir Geoffrey Howe raised VAT from 8 per cent to 15 per cent,
shortly after denying any such plans at the preceding election.
Mr Mellor said in a BBC interview that there was no conflict between
lowering taxes and increasing public expenditure. 'The record shows we have
been able to strike a balance', he said, adding that Labour had yet to show
how it would 'outbid' the government on spending without tax increases.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Downing Street quiet on what Sir Robin Butler saw
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE tight-lipped world of Downing Street news management was itself under
close scrutiny yesterday when it emerged that Sir Bernard Ingham, for 11
years Mrs Margaret Thatcher's press overlord, had found himself victim of
the censor's blue pencil.
Infamous for his non-attributable quotability, Sir Bernard's autobiography
has undergone some selective and, most probably, financially damaging
editing by the sensation-shy Cabinet Office. The memoirs, entitled Kill the
Messenger, have been long-awaited for revelations on the more controversial
moments of the Thatcher years.
Not least, pundits were anxious to read an account of the Westland
helicopter affair in 1985-86 which led to the resignation of Mr Michael
Heseltine as defence secretary.
Under the so-called Radcliffe rules, however, civil servants and ministers
must submit their drafts to the Cabinet Office.
The Sunday Times, ru-moured to have paid a six-figure sum for the serial
rights, yesterday had to make the best of having Sir Robin Butler, Britain's
chief home civil servant, as its unpaid editor. While carrying an officially
abridged version it tried to make good the damage with a front page report
of what Sir Robin saw.
Deletions included passages criticising Mr Heseltine's judgment and others
on Mrs Thatcher's often stormy dealings with European partners and Sir
Geoffrey Howe, her deputy prime minister.
On the key question of whether Downing Street or the Department of Trade and
Industry leaked the memorandum from the then solicitor general which was
critical of Mr Heseltine, Sir Bernard was allowed to go on the record with
his plea of innocence.
Downing Street yesterday was characteristically taciturn about whether The
Sunday Times would be hauled over the coals for its revelations - as, it
pointed out, it was unclear whether or not they were revelations.
Its classic reply: 'We don't answer hypothetical questions,' was a
well-known formula of Sir Bernard's, who was yesterday understood to be
unavailable for comment.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Fabian call for overhaul of regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER, Industrial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SYSTEM for regulating utilities should be radically overhauled, with
commissions introduced to hold open hearings on the utilities' plans,
according to a Fabian Society paper published today.
The society, a left-of-centre think tank, argues that US-style regulatory
commissions should be created to oversee the water, gas and electricity
industries.
At the open hearings consumers and other interested parties could give
evidence. The commissions would be much more open than the current
regulatory offices Ofwat, Ofgas and Offer.
The study, by Professor Michael Waterson of Reading University, argues that
commissions holding open hearings would be more appropriate for water, gas
and electricity because there are limited prospects for introducing
competition there.
He argues that forms of regulation should be tailored to the characteristics
of the industries concerned, however. So in industries such as
telecommunications, where technological change is opening opportunities for
competition, the current body, Oftel, is perfectly adequate.
Prof Waterson acknowledges that public commissions can be much more
expensive than regulatory offices. He says the latter system might be
usefully extended to organisations such as the Post Office and British Rail,
which are becoming more commercial.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Japanese to open machine tool plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW Japanese assault on an important sector of the European machinery
market is officially launched tomorrow from the unlikely venue of a
refurbished factory in Salisbury.
Within sight of the cathedral spire, Kitagawa, the world's largest producer
of power chucks for machine tools, has joined forces with Mr Tertius
Threipland, a British entrepreneur, to begin manufacturing chucks in Europe
for the first time.
The move could increase the competitive pressures on the five big European
producers, of which the 600 Group's Pratt Burnerd is the best known in the
UK. Many producers have been hit badly by recession.
Mr Threipland is chairman and managing director of Kitagawa Europe, a
partnership with the Japanese parent company, which for 10 years has been
distributing Kitagawa products into European markets.
The partners are switching to manufacturing in Europe because of long-term
growth prospects and, said Mr Threipland, because the 1992 single market
reforms might make it difficult to import chucks from Japan.
He said: 'We hope we will now be more acceptable in Germany, which has been
the most nationalistic about machinery and accessories, particularly on
conspicuous products like chucks.'
Mr Threipland, who for years has wanted to own a UK chuck manufacturer,
admitted: 'We had to fight quite hard to convince the Japanese to choose the
UK rather than Belgium and Germany.'
The UK was chosen because of labour costs, availability of technology and
skills, and the fact that the European sales headquarters was already in
Salisbury.
The factory is one of the few opened recently in Europe in the machine tool
sector. In spite of the recession in the UK, Mr Threipland hopes it will be
running at two-thirds capacity by early autumn, producing 200 chucks a month
 -of which 70 per cent will be for export.
The factory now employs six people, but as the product range is expanded in
the next five years the workforce should reach 40 to 45. The total
investment is expected to reach Pounds 5m by then.
Japanese companies rarely enter manufacturing joint ventures with individual
entrepreneurs overseas, although associations are more common between the
big Japanese trading houses and foreigners.
There will be no Japanese-style company anthems, but Mr Threipland did have
the builders and decorators working at Japanese speeds over Christmas to get
the factory ready. It was completed on New Year's Day.

FT  13 MAY 91 / S Africa squatter camp attack claims 27 lives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AT LEAST 27 people were killed yesterday in an attack on a squatter camp
near Johannesburg, despite last week's outline agreement between the African
National Congress (ANC) and the South African government on steps to end
violence in the townships.
Squatters said their attackers, Zulu inhabitants of the local hostel in the
township of Kagiso, were armed with spears and other sharp instruments.
At the insistence of Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, spears were omitted
from a list of weapons banned last week by the South African authorities.
The ANC is demanding that the carrying of spears be illegal, and has said it
will pull out of talks on the country's political future unless this demand
is met.
The ANC has given the government until Thursday to comply with this demand,
while its national executive will meet later today to consider the rest of
the outline agreement reached last week with Pretoria.
This involved the banning of all so-called 'traditional weapons' apart from
spears and sticks, the phasing-out of single-sex hostels and the prohibition
of the use of live ammunition by police for crowd control.
That agreement was reached between Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC deputy
president, and Mr FW de Klerk, the president, assisted by a handful of
advisers.
ANC officials stress that it could still be rejected by the organisation's
national executive, triggering an earlier threat by the ANC to withdraw from
talks.
Mr Mandela said in an interview published in the Johannesburg Sunday Times
that he was 'optimistic that we would be able to save the peace process'.
However, he stressed that they would pull out of talks unless the government
met every demand in its recent seven-point ultimatum, which included the
issues addressed in last week's talks.
Meanwhile, South African police opened fire early on Saturday morning on a
group of right-wing whites who attacked a squatter camp in the western
Transvaal.
It was the first time in decades that police had fired on whites, and two
white farmers were injured.
The whites had attacked a group of blacks who had re-occupied land from
which they were forcibly removed 13 years ago.
Judgment is expected later today in the trial of Mrs Winnie Mandela, on
charges of kidnapping and assault with intent to commit grievous bodily
harm.
Mr Justice Michael Stegmann, the presiding judge, is expected to deliver his
verdict by Wednesday.

FT  13 MAY 91 / International Economic Indicators: How to compare relative
economic wealth - National accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOST CONVENIENT way to compare the economic size and wealth of countries
is to convert figures for gross national product into a common currency
using market exchange rates. But the results can be misleading.
The dangers are illustrated in this week's table, in which data on the gross
national product or gross domestic product of each country have been
converted into a common currency, the European currency unit (Ecu).
Some surprising things emerge. For example, Japanese GNP apparently
contracted last year, to Ecu2,332.4bn from Ecu2,625.2bn in 1989, so reducing
Japan's share in the total output of the six largest industrialised
countries to 22.5 per cent in 1990, from 24.2 per cent in 1989. Yet Japan's
economic growth rate was the highest of the six countries, as the lower half
of the table shows.
This apparent contradiction is explained by the yen's 21 per cent
depreciation against the Ecu between 1989 and 1990. Large fluctuations in
exchange rates can give a misleading picture of changes in economic
fortunes.
What matters in comparing economic size is the relative purchasing power
these figures represent: the quantity of goods that nominal GNP will buy in
each country.
The OECD has calculated the levels of income needed in each national
currency to purchase an identical basket of goods and services at prevailing
domestic prices. In 1990 a specific basket of goods costing dollars 100 to
buy in the US would have cost Y19,800 in Japan and pounds 63.40 in the UK.
Converting each country's GNP into dollars using these purchasing power
parity (PPP) exchange rates provides a better guide to economic size, one
that adjusts for fluctuations in exchange rates. The Japanese share in total
PPP-adjusted GNP did rise from 18.6 per cent in 1989 to 19.3 per cent in
1990, as one would expect.
The adjustment for PPP produces a very different picture of relative
economic size in 1990. Both the US and the UK have a higher share of the six
countries' total output on the basis of the PPP measure than on the basis of
current exchange rates, and vice versa for the other four.
The graph shows levels of average GNP per head in 1990, converted into
dollars. At current exchange rates (on the vertical axis) Germany had the
highest income per head, followed by Japan and the US. Using PPP exchange
rates, however, (on the horizontal axis) this order is reversed.
At current exchange rates the relative size and income per head of the
German and Japanese economies is over-stated, relative to their purchasing
power equivalent - they both lie to the left of the 45 degree line.
This means that prices overall are higher in Japan than in the US at current
exchange rates. Why then do US companies not sell more goods in Japan, until
the price differences disappear? Perhaps transport costs, tariffs, or
restrictive practices prevent US companies from doing so or, alternatively,
Japanese consumers prefer Japanese goods.
A better explanation is that prices are higher for non-tradable goods
(services such as domestic banking and insurance, taxis and hair cuts) in
the continental European economies and Japan than in the US and UK, because
these economies are relatively more efficient at producing tradable (largely
manufactured) goods, and relatively less efficient at producing non-tradable
goods. Thus, these four countries have higher real exchange rates (defined
as the relative price of non-tradable goods in terms of tradable goods).
The prices of tradable goods are brought into rough equality by global
competition (ignoring the impact of trade barriers). Consequently these
countries will have relatively high domestic prices for non-tradable goods
at market exchange rates. This will boost the value of their output at
current exchange rates.
If developing countries were to be included in the chart they would all lie
below the 45 degree line. This is because they are relatively less
productive than developed countries at producing tradable goods than they
are at producing non-tradable goods. Thus dollars 1 buys far more services
in, say, Indonesia than in the US at current exchange rates.
In recent weeks the FT has published the following tables: Balance of
Payments (April 15), Money and Finance (April 22), Production and Employment
(April 29) and Prices and Competitiveness (May 7). Back issues can be

FT  13 MAY 91 / Israel mars superpower tete-a-tete: Baker and Bessmertnykh
seek to 'kick start' Mideast peace process
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER and HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAIRO, JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR James Baker, the US secretary of state, and his Soviet counterpart, Mr
Alexander Bessmertnykh, met over a 'working dinner' on the banks of the Nile
last night in an against-the-odds attempt to 'kick start' the Middle East
peace process.
The deepening dilemma facing the two men is how to persuade Israel to take
even the first tentative steps towards an historic compromise with the
Arabs, based on key UN resolutions 242 and 338 requiring Israeli withdrawal
from territories occupied in the 1967 war.
As they sat down for their repast the news from Israel could hardly have
been less promising. Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the Israeli premier, again insisted
at the weekend that Israel would not withdraw from the occupied territories.
Mr Baker would also not have been encouraged by the negative Israeli
reaction to his announcement on Saturday that Gulf states led by Saudi
Arabia had agreed to send an observer to the proposed regional Middle East
peace conference. Mr Shamir's senior adviser dismissed the announcement as
unimportant.
He said such countries had to go much further, ending hostile relations and
the Arab economic boycott of Israel and taking a full part in any peace
negotiations. 'We don't need observers as far as the Arab states are
concerned, we need participants,' Mr Yossi Ben-Aharon, the director of the
prime ministry, said.
However, there was one small chink of light from Mr David Levy, the foreign
minister, who adopted a less strident tone, offering the Gulf Co-operation
Council (GCC) a cautious welcome and expressing hope that a peace process
could be started.
Mr Shamir also repeated a somewhat softened line on the key issue of the
settlements by saying they would eventually be a subject for negotiation,
but not at this stage.
This fits with the position Mr Shamir has consistently adopted when
confronting the demand that a peace conference be based on a 'land for
peace' formula. He says this would pre-ordain an outcome unacceptable to his
government. But he has left open the possibility that all such demands could
be negotiated at a second stage of a two-step peace process.
Mr Baker, whose fourth mission to the Middle East in two months has been
variously described as 'do-or-die' and 'make-or-break', is in danger of
seeing his efforts running into the sand unless he can produce a formula to
narrow what appear to be almost irreconcilable differences between the two
sides.
With Israel insisting that any regional gathering must be limited to a more
or less ceremonial introductory session hosted jointly by the US and the
Soviet Union, and the Arabs demanding UN involvement in a conference with
real powers, Mr Baker and Mr Bessmertnykh have their work cut out for them.
Perhaps the most promising development in the absence of any sign of real
progress is that for the first time in more than a generation Washington and
Moscow are actively co-operating in an attempt to break the Arab-Israeli
impasse.
The idea that the foreign ministers of the two superpowers would be dining
in Cairo in an effort to resolve one of the world's most intractable
problems would have been unthinkable until recently. Whether the fact that
it took place in the only Arab capital to have recognised Israel will budge
the hardline Israeli government is another matter.

A BRITISH company blacklisted by the US Treasury as a suspected agent of the
Iraqi government was yesterday cleared of suspicion and allowed to continue
trading with American corporations.
Sollatek, an electronics company based in London, is the fourth organisation
named by the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control on April 1 to have
been issued with a licence pending its removal from the blacklist.
The action follows discussions with officials at the UK Department of Trade
and Industry. PMK, Qudos and Liverpool Polytechnic were granted similar
licences last week.
Mr Manhal Allos, director, said last night he had not ruled out legal action
against the US government.

<TEXT>
'SAVE DEMOCRACY, change society' says a slogan scrawled on a wall in
Kathmandu. It has been just a year since the people of Nepal marched through
the streets demanding multi-party elections and a new constitution to limit
the power of their monarch, King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev.
Yesterday, 11m of the Himalayan kingdom's 18m people went to the polls to
exercise their new rights.
Voters lined up hours before polling stations opened at 8am, with many then
waiting hours to vote. 'I am voting for the party that I like,' said a
77-year-old woman. Beaming with pride, she added: 'This is the first time I
have voted in my life.'
The two main parties in the race for parliamentary seats are the Congress
party and the Nepalese Communist party, former partners in the interim
coalition government which has ruled for a year.
In Kirtipur, on the outskirts of Kathmandu, voters queued at the local Hindu
shrine doubling as a polling station. 'I am very, very happy to vote, even
if I have to wait in the queue for five hours,' said Surendra, 22, a
business student at the local college.
He said he voted for the Congress party, but he stood with arms linked
around his friend, Ram, 20, who says he voted for the Communists.
'This town will divide half for Congress, half for the Communists,' said
Ram, 'but it will not cause any problems. The elections decide only the
parliament and not our relationships. The government may not last, but
friendships will.'
More than 75,000 policemen and 100,000 soldiers were called out to guard
polling stations. Soldiers armed with submachine-guns patrolled the streets
in armoured vehicles, despite a promise from the government to deploy troops
only in the event of violence.
Shops in all of the big cities were closed for election day and the streets
of the capital were virtually empty, in stark contrast to the frenzied days
of campaigning that led up to the election.
For weeks Nepal has been besieged by party vehicles, blaring slogans and
playing Nepalese folk music 24 hours a day. Walls, buses, trees, and houses
are covered with colourful drawings of the various party symbols - cows,
trees, suns, and fish  - as well as Nepali and English graffito asking for
voter support.
Mr Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, the prime minister and leader of the Congress
party, toured the country in an army helicopter for four days before
polling.
Throughout Nepal engineers set up computers, facsimile machines and
high-speed printers in preparation for voting. Mr Anders Koldby, a Danish
consultant whose government contributed Dollars 1m of computer equipment to
the Nepal Election Commission, said: 'Our biggest problem is that only 50
districts have telephones. In the other 25 districts, we are trying to run
fax machines by battery.'
The election commission now has 26 computers and 50 districts have fax
machines. Mr Neel Kantha Uprety, co-ordinator of the computer division of
the Election Commission, said the problem was to convince people they could
work with the equipment. 'Some are afraid to touch a computer. They see it
as a magic box. It's a whole new world for us.'

FT  13 MAY 91 / Poland to discuss arrears settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Euromarkets Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLAND HAS indicated it is willing to negotiate a settlement of its Dollars
1bn (Pounds 588m) interest arrears owed to commercial banks before starting
talks on a comprehensive agreement over its medium- and long-term bank debt.
The move, at a meeting with leading bankers in Frankfurt last week, marks a
significant shift in the Polish government's negotiating position. It was
previously unwilling to negotiate over arrears except as part of a
comprehensive debt agreement.
The government, which has not paid any interest on its bank debt since the
start of last year, also offered last week a Dollars 100m interest payment
and said it would deposit 20 per cent of interest going forward into a
special account at the Bank for International Settlements in Basle.
Banks are holding out for more, but the offer has opened the way for
progress to a comprehensive debt agreement, including debt-cut options where
loans will be exchanged for concessional bonds, bankers say. More talks with
Poland's bank creditor group are expected this month.
Poland's bank debt comprises about Dollars 10bn of its total Dollars 45bn
foreign debt. The US and other nations have pressed the banks to match a
debt write-off of at least 50 per cent granted by official creditors of the
Paris Club. But many banks resist such a large write-off.

<TEXT>
THE Serbian minority living in Croatia's region of Krajina voted yesterday
in a referendum on whether they wanted to unite with Serbia and stay within
a federal Yugoslavia.
An early count indicated that most people voted in favour of joining Serbia.
It was the first of five plebiscites to be held this month across the
country and a 'yes' vote will add to tensions between the minority Serbs and
the Croatian authorities.
Croatia, along with the other western republic, Slovenia, has already taken
steps towards secession and insists that the present federation of six
republics be transformed into a loose organisation of independent states.
Serbian leaders in Krajina said they would fight attempts by Croatia to
impose 'outside rule' over their territory, which they have proclaimed
autonomous. This is despite an accord reached last Thursday by the
collective presidency to try to halt clashes between Serbs and Croats which
have brought the country to the brink of civil war. Croatian authorities
declared the referendum illegal.

MR STANISLAW Tyminski, the main populist challenger to Poland's ruling
Solidarity establishment, was formally voted in yesterday as leader of his
new 'X' party at a congress in Warsaw.
The Polish-Canadian businessman has been barred from running for parliament
in elections expected this autumn, following a new electoral law requiring
five years' residence to become a deputy. The electoral law, approved by the
Sejm, the parliament's lower chamber, on Friday, has yet to be passed by the
upper house.
It adopts a proportional system for the Sejm favouring smaller parties. The
Senate will be elected on a first-past-the-post system. The 'X' party's
delegates, representing some 5,000 members, met behind closed doors with
officials promising details of its programme later in the week.

Greece's current account deficit fell 13.6 per cent to Dollars 1.69bn
(Pounds 1bn) in the first quarter, reflecting a sharp rise in invisible
receipts and better export performance, writes Kerin Hope in Athens.
But the visible trade gap widened by 14.3 per cent to Dollars 3.45bn, mainly
because of higher prices for imported fuel, the Bank of Greece says. It is
the first time in over two years that the current-account deficit has shown
a quarterly improvement.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Supreme Soviet to allow sacking of workers for indiscipline
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Supreme Soviet has also amended labour legislation to permit managements
to fire workers who are guilty of indiscipline without the agreement of the
trade unions. The agreement is a compromise, following a veto by President
Mikhail Gorbachev of an earlier Supreme Soviet decision to allow managements
to fire workers freely. The new decision lays down that unions must be
consulted, and that their veto will remain where the labour code has not
been breached - as over redundancies. Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and
Russian Federation leader Boris Yeltsin yesterday met heads of 14 of
Russia's 16 autonomous republics to try to further unify the nation, news
reports said. The two have put aside their bitter political rivalry in
recent days. The republics represent about 20m of the 147m people in the
huge Russian republic.
At the meeting, it was decided that the autonomous republics would sign the
Union Treaty as equal subjects, the Interfax news agency reported. The
Treaty is Mr Gorbachev's plan to redefine the relationship between the
central government and the republics.

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Soviet Parliament yesterday approved an experiment for 'contract', or
volunteer sailors, in a move which is seen as the first tentative step to
transforming the vast Soviet armed services from a conscript to a
professional force.
The Supreme Soviet also approved a cut in naval service from three to two
years, bringing it into line with the army.
Mr Anatoly Lukyanov, the Supreme Soviet Speaker, said after the result had
been declared that 'a professional army is born'. Colonel General Grigory
Krivosheyev, deputy chief of staff of the armed forces, told the deputies
the experiment, to run from 1991 to 1994, would provide vital information on
the possibility of creating a professional army.
The experiment will run in four 'large naval units' - possibly the four main
Soviet fleets. Under it, seamen and petty officers will all serve an initial
six months - after which those wishing to volunteer will serve a further two
and a half years, while those wishing to remain as conscripts will serve a
further 18 months.
The pay of the volunteers is likely to be much higher than the conscripts -
ranging from Rbs250 to Rbs400 a month, compared to wages which are as low as
Rbs10 a month. Soviet forces are estimated at around 5m strong, with the
navy accounting for only about 500,000 of these.
The army has so far strongly opposed a move towards a professional service,
arguing that it is an indispensable medium of bringing together the diverse
nationalities of the Soviet Union, and that it would be too expensive. The
Interior Ministry Troops, or MVD, whose numbers have been swollen over the
past year as their services were increasingly required to cope with internal
strife, are also to discuss introducing professional status.

FT  13 MAY 91 / US team to advise on Soviet food distribution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER RIDDELL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US will send a team of agriculture experts to Moscow this week to help
solve the Soviet Union's food distribution problems.
President George Bush's offer to provide advice on a distribution system
follows a 45-minute telephone conversation between him and President Mikhail
Gorbachev at the weekend. It comes as the US administration considers a
Soviet request for a Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 880m) agricultural export credit.
White House officials have said that, while Mr Bush is sympathetic to easing
any shortage of food on humanitarian grounds, he is worried by the lack of
movement towards a market economy.
A senior US national security adviser said last week that Mr Bush believed
that what the Soviets needed most was technical assistance. 'There is almost
certainly enough food in the Soviet Union. What's happening is it's not
getting to the markets, partly because of transportation, partly because
prices are so low that people are holding off the market, thinking that
prices are going to go up.'
The mission of farm experts could thus be a prelude to approval of some form
of credits, which are backed by legislators from farming states. Senator
Robert Dole, the Republican minority leader from the grain state of Kansas,
said yesterday that the Senate should take up the export credit guarantee
issue this week as long as there was provision for certain individual Soviet
republics to participate.
The experts' team will be lead by Mr Richard Crowder, under-secretary of
agriculture, and will include Mr Ed Hewett, the leading Soviet specialist on
the national security council staff.
Mr Bush and Mr Gorbachev also discussed remaining arms control issues,
notably the proposed agreement on reducing strategic arms and remaining
problems over implementation of the treaty to reduce conventional forces in
Europe, according to the White House.

<TEXT>
MR MICHEL Camdessus, IMF chairman, yesterday pledged support for Egypt's
efforts to persuade foreign creditors to forgive a large part of its Dollars
35bn (Pounds 20.7bn) foreign debt.
Mr Camdessus told President Hosni Mubarak the fund would back Egypt's
application for debt forgiveness at a meeting of the Paris Club of creditor
nations this month. He was speaking on the eve of this week's signing in
Washington of a new Dollars 400m standby agreement, under which Egypt has
pledged to press ahead faster with liberalising its economy.
'Your country has a convincing programme. I think it will get strong support
from the international community,' Mr Camdessus is reported to have said. Mr
Mubarak leaves later this week to visit France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg
and Turkey, in efforts to secure debt forgiveness under terms like those
accorded to Poland recently.
The Paris Club last month agreed to cut Warsaw's Dollars 35bn official debt
by 30 per cent over the next three years and by 20 per cent more if Poland
stuck to an agreed economic reform programme. Egypt recently raised energy
prices and import tariffs in a drive to cut its budget deficit, a key IMF
demand.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Chancellor faces growing pressure to cut base rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN LAMONT faces a tough decision this week on whether to bow to
growing pressure for a cut in UK interest rates or to hold out for further
evidence of a decline in inflation.
The signs at the weekend were that the chancellor may hold off from easing
borrowing conditions over the next few days, partly to signal his
unhappiness about the high level of underlying inflation, particularly as
measured by wage increases.
However, the government will face a barrage of calls from industry and
political opponents to cut base rates, now at 12 per cent, in the light of
fresh evidence about the depth of the recession.
Concern about the most serious economic decline for 10 years promises to be
a factor in the voting in Thursday's by-election in Monmouth.
Government figures due on Thursday are expected to show that unemployment
rose last month by about 85,000, following the record increase of 113,000 in
March.
The latest data on bank lending, due today, are likely to illustrate the low
level of demand in the economy, in spite of the recent sequence of rate cuts
which have brought base rates down from 14 per cent in mid-February.
Speculation has mounted that Mr Lamont will use the opportunity of a large
fall in the retail price index, due to be announced on Friday, to sanction a
further  1/2 percentage point cut. The annual rate of increase in the RPI,
8.2 per cent in March, is likely to have come down by about 2 percentage
points last month - largely due to technical factors resulting from the
community charge and changes in mortgage rates.
Underlying inflation - the RPI less the effects of the poll tax and interest
rates - appears to be coming down less quickly. Moreover, the latest figures
for the rate of increase in average earnings, to be announced on Thursday,
are expected to show this figure was stuck at more than 9 per cent in March,
the same as in February.
UK monetary officials are concerned that companies may be trying to pass on
to consumers, in the form of higher prices, too great a proportion of their
own cost increases due to wage rises.
Last week Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, issued
a veiled warning against the idea of cutting rates too quickly.
One theory is that policymakers may deliberately pass on the chance of
cutting rates on Friday - if only to keep financial markets from linking
announcements about falls in the RPI to an automatic easing in monetary
conditions.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Middle East peace effort falters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US officials were last night gloomy about progress towards a Middle East
peace conference after six hours of inconclusive talks between Mr James
Baker, secretary of state, and Syria's President Hafez al-Assad.
A senior official said there had been 'no particular progress' on critical
issues such as Arab insistence, against Israeli objections, on United
Nations involvement in a proposed peace gathering.
Mr Baker, who is on his fourth visit to the region since the end of the Gulf
war in March, left Damascus for Cairo where he held a 'working dinner' last
night with Mr Alexander Bessmertnykh, the Soviet foreign minister. Mr Baker
is due to visit Jordan and Israel in the next few days.
Washington and Moscow are collaborating in efforts to organise a regional
peace conference, but these are in danger of collapsing because of wide
differences between Israel and the Arabs, especially Syria.
Mr Baker tried unsuccessfully yesterday to persuade Mr Assad to show greater
flexibility on the details of the proposed Middle East conference.
Mr Assad wants the full application of UN resolutions requiring Israeli
withdrawal from occupied Arab land, including Syria's Golan Heights,
captured in the 1967 war and subsequently annexed.
A spokesman for Mr Assad, seeking to put the best face on unpromising
discussions with Mr Baker, said that 'President Assad reiterated Syria's
real desire to establish a just and comprehensive peace in accordance with
UN resolutions . . . He also affirmed the continuation of Syria's readiness
to co-operate with current efforts to achieve the best formula that would
push forward the peace process.'
Mr Baker, in concert with Mr Bessmertnykh, is trying to increase the
pressure on Israel and the Arabs to bury their differences, but he is
battling against a long legacy of bitterness and distrust.
US officials in Cairo were pessimistic about chances of Israeli
co-operation. will know exactly what separates the parties and then we will
determine what the next steps are,' one official said.
Mr Yitzhak Shamir, Israel's premier, re-stated his determination at the
weekend never to yield territory seized in 1967. 'We will not give up, not
only Jerusalem, but any portion of the land of Israel,' Mr Shamir said in a
speech.
Mr Baker received what amounted to a glimmer of good news on the eve of his
latest Middle East shuttle when the Gulf states led by Saudi Arabia
announced they would send an observer to a proposed peace conference.
The six Gulf Co-operation Council states also said they would participate in
discussions with Israel on such issues as disarmament, water conservation
and the environment.
US officials described these undertakings as something of a 'breakthrough',
since the Gulf states had never before signalled a willingness to sit down
at the same negotiating table as Israel; but in a statement that is certain
to displease the Americans, a senior Israeli yesterday described the GCC
announcement as unimportant.

FT  13 MAY 91 / UK softens stance on EC social charter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and IAN HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT can now support most elements of the European Social Charter,
although remaining opposed to some of the proposals, according to Mr Michael
Howard, the employment secretary.
His remarks, in an interview with the Financial Times, suggest that much of
the hostility towards the charter expressed by the British government under
Mrs Margaret Thatcher has disappeared.
Mr Howard said he had been 'very encouraged' by the recent approach of Ms
Vasso Papandreou, European social affairs commissioner, and by changes in
the form and content of legislative proposals.
His comments represent the most conciliatory note struck so far between the
British government and the European Commission over the social charter. The
government originally criticised it on the grounds that it would damage
business. They follow attempts by Mr John Major, the prime minister, to
improve relations with the European Community. Mr Howard said he believed
Britain would now be opposed to only a dozen of the 50 proposals expected in
the 'social action programme'.
The minister has said until now that a third of the social action proposals
would be acceptable, a third would have to be negotiated and a third would
be unacceptable. He said changes in the past six months had led to a
significant shift in these proportions.
'There are many measures which we fully support, indeed the majority of
measures coming out under the social action programme. There are some we
shall continue to resist,' said Mr Howard last week.
The government had managed to negotiate changes in the form of some
proposals, he said. It had also been encouraged because some of the
proposals which it thought were going to appear as being directives have
become non-binding recommendations. He said he had been encouraged when Ms
Papandreou accepted his suggestions earlier this year that draft proposals
should be shown to member states before being published, and that each
government should help evaluate the costs to business.
Among the proposals which have proved less difficult than the British
government feared is the directive on written employment contracts first
published in November. However, directives on working time and employee
consultation remain controversial.
Separately, Mr Howard said he was keeping under review the rule that the
employer-led Training and Enterprise Councils should be headed only by
chairmen and chief executives of private-sector companies, and in no case by
personnel directors.
He said a future trade union act following a general election would probably
contain proposals to tighten the regulation of union financing in view of
anomalies shown by the handling of National Union of Mineworkers' finances.
Mr Howard also reiterated that the 26 wages councils setting minimum wages
for 2.5m workers had 'no permanent place' and would eventually be abolished
by the government.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Hard Ecu plan to be reviewed: UK may back down after
concession on single currency timing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH and DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN MAY back down on its hard Ecu plan following an important concession
on the timing of a single currency proposed at a meeting of EC finance
ministers.
The hard Ecu is a central plank in the British government's ideas for
European economic and monetary union but the idea has gained few supporters
in the rest of Europe.
The proposal will be reviewed by senior UK officials in the next few weeks
with the option of dropping it as a goodwill gesture to Britain's partners.
Such a turnabout could raise political difficulties because the Conservative
government has long insisted that its hard Ecu alternative has been
generating interest abroad in spite of Labour scepticism.
According to the concession proposed at the weekend meeting in Luxembourg by
Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, Britain could sign
a treaty on Emu later this year without agreeing on the final goal, to which
the UK attaches strong reservations, of a single European currency and a new
European central bank.
That would mean Britain could join the other EC nations in stage two of Emu
but leave open the question of further involvement until the late 1990s.
According to some countries' schedule, the third and final phase of Emu
would begin around 2000, and usher in the full operation of a new, single
currency and the new central bank.
The general feeling from the meeting, said Mr Philippe Maystadt, the Belgian
finance minister, was that 'no country should be allowed to stop others
advancing to Emu and that no country could have a single currency imposed on
it'.
The proposal was supported by Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's competition
commissioner. 'It could be made clear that the UK was formally reserving its
position, not just on when, but on whether, it accepts a single currency,'
Sir Leon said.
The British government reacted cautiously to Mr Delors' proposal. Mr Norman
Lamont, the UK chancellor, said the suggestion was 'constructive but not a
dramatic breakthrough'. There were still 'a million questions', many of them
posed by other countries, that had yet to be answered about Emu.
Downing Street also made clear that the option was just one of many coming
out of the negotiations.
Tory MPs appeared divided on the issue although, at first sight, the Delors
plan may appeal to the leadership on the grounds that it should largely
remove the controversy within the party on the Emu issue in the run up to a
general election that most now believe will come in the autumn.
However, there is also considerable concern that acceptance of the
compromise might be seen as tacit endorsement of a 'two-speed' Europe -
something the government has always vigorously opposed.
The hard Ecu, proposed two years ago with Mrs Margaret Thatcher's support,
was designed partly to keep Britain in the mainstream of the Emu debate.
The proposal is for a new currency with anti-inflationary characteristics,
which would be used by European businesses alongside existing national
currencies. It would be separate from the existing basket Ecu - the notional
currency which the European Commission hopes will evolve ultimately into a
new single financial unit for Europe.
The hard Ecu strategy is to be discussed by the main Whitehall committee
responsible for the approach to Emu. The committee is chaired by Mr Nigel
Wickes, a second permanent secretary at the Treasury, and includes
representatives from the Foreign Office, the Bank of England and the prime
minister's policy unit.
In the light of the less than wholehearted support received from the rest of
Europe, the hard Ecu could be abandoned, although Britain would probably
continue to press for some of the basic tenets behind the proposal, such as
the need to fight inflation.
Apart from the main discussions, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French finance
minister, sought to smooth over differences with the Germany on the timing
of the formation of the European Central Bank.
His officials spoke only of an institutition 'pre-figuring' the bank being
set up in 1994. However, Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister,
remained insistent that it should be formed only on the eve of a single
currency.

decision, while at the same time allowing the Emu process to go ahead'.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Trade blocs are here to stay: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico's gross national product is less than 4 per cent of America's. Its
exports account for only one third of one per cent of US domestic
consumption. So why does the prospect of a free trade agreement with Mexico
excite so much more interest in Washington than the Uruguay Round trade
talks - which affect US trade with the whole world, including economic
powers such as Japan and Germany?
The answer lies partly in American indifference to the wider world. Mexico
has a long border with the US; the hope that free trade will encourage it to
export goods rather than people is taken seriously. Mention the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), however, and you invite the blankest
of stares. The man on Main Street probably could not identify Geneva on a
map, still less comprehend why a bunch of European bureaucrats should exert
influence over US trade policy. Never forget that international bodies count
for little here: after 40 years, some congressmen still believe the World
Bank is an aid agency based in New York. Gatt is obscurity squared.
The deeper answer is that bilateral pacts, such as the planned agreement
with Mexico, are more acceptable to the aggressive American psyche that the
abstract logic of multilateral trade liberalisation. Support for free trade
in the US has a short history. In the late 19th century when Britain was
trumpeting the virtues of trade liberalisation (and gradually sinking below
the waves as an economic power) the US was busy creating an industrial
powerhouse - behind high tariff walls. The US conversion came in the
aftermath of the second world war, when Europe and Japan were weak and no
threat to the US market.
With the loss of economic hegemony, analysts are again questioning the
merits of traditional free trade. US fears are encapsulated in a recent
essay* by Mr Clyde Prestowitz, a former senior official at the commerce
department who heads the Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington
think-tank. Mr Prestowitz invents the term 'Gattism' to describe 'a belief,
bordering on religious faith, in the power of ever more detailed trade rules
to solve major domestic and international trade problems'. He dismisses the
Uruguay Round as a 'futile, legalistic crusade to homogenise different
nations'.
The Gatt is based on two fundamental principles: 'national treatment' and
'most-favoured nation'. Under national treatment, members agree to treat
foreign companies exactly as they treat domestic companies. Under
most-favoured nation, liberal rules agreed between any two Gatt signatories
must be extended to all others. Mr Prestowitz (and many others) regard both
principles as unjust. This is because they do not require comparable rules
to be applied in all member countries. A restrictive country can impose all
kinds of barriers (provided it does not discriminate against foreign
companies) while its exporters piggy-back on the liberal laws agreed
elsewhere.
'Gattism' reflects a belief that unilateral trade disarmament is beneficial.
(Like Christians turning the other cheek, free market purists welcome
dumping and other infractions because they initially benefit the consumer.)
The economic case for unilateralism, however, is weaker than often
pretended. If you make the usual sweeping neo-classical assumptions - no
economies of scale, no unemployment (because prices clear all markets) and
no uncertainty about the future - you can show that a small country should
eschew protection.
But even in this fairy tale world, neo-classical theory indicates that a
large country such as the US can benefit by imposing an 'optimal' tariff: at
a certain level of protection, the gain from the improvement in its terms of
trade more than offsets the loss of imports. Game theory suggests this
remains true even if other countries retaliate.
Free market purists are thus being dogmatic when they claim to have 'proved'
that unilateral trade liberalisation is beneficial. It need not be even in
their idealised world. Nor is the empirical evidence compelling: the huge
success of Japan and South Korea suggests that, for individual countries, a
combination of export promotion and import restriction can be more
profitable than unilateral trade disarmament. But it is not an option for
the world as a whole. The question, therefore, is how to persuade countries
to pursue policies that may not always be in their own interests but which
benefit everybody in the long run.
One popular option is to lay greater stress on reciprocity - a principle
that horrifies purists. 'I will open my markets if you will open yours' is
an offer that politicians and businessmen find difficult to reject. Unlike
strict 'Gattism', it seems self-evidently fair. Yet it is most easily
pursued through bilateral agreements in which like-minded countries can
directly trade concessions.
Seen through US eyes, mercantilist Japan is dominating Asia through a
network of direct foreign investment links. European Community nations,
while outwardly in favour of multilateral trade liberalisation, are
consolidating the advantages of preferential trading links through the
Single Market programme. In the circumstances, who can blame the US for
trying to forge its own regional trade bloc? Whatever happens to the Uruguay
Round, pacts with Canada and Mexico mark only the beginning of a more
assertive - and more selfish  - US trade policy.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Justinian: The admissibility of evidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUIS BLOM-COOPER, QC
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The two former City merchant bankers who are awaiting trial on charges
arising out of the Guiness affair failed in the Court of Appeal (Criminal
Division) to have the testimony they both gave to Department of Trade
appointed inspectors declared inadmissible at their forthcoming trial.
Mr Roger Seelig, former corporate finance director at Morgan Grenfell and
Lord Spens, former director of corporate finance at Henry Ansbacher, may
have a legitimate grievance that the law does not cover the questioning of
those involved in inspectors' investigations under the Companies Act.
Answers given by any person to inspectors are admissible in guidance in
subsequent proceedings. But are the answers safeguarded in the way that
police questioning is?
The legal issue is simple enough. Are DTI inspectors within the meaning of
the phrase in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, namely 'persons
charged with the duty of investigating offences?' If they are, they would be
bound to caution witnesses who appeared before them. Even if the inspectors
were investigating criminal offences, and there had been a breach of the
code established under the 1984 Act, it would still have been in order for
the trial judge to admit the evidence.
Mr Justice Henry, who will be trying the second Guiness case and who
conducted the pre-trial hearing, had decided that fairness to the accused
would not be threatened by allowing the evidence to be heard by the jury.
(Clearly, the prosecution attached great importance to the admissions made
by the two men to the inspectors.) The judge also rejected the claim that
improper means had been used to compel the two men to incriminate
themselves.
The Court of Appeal had little difficulty in concluding that inspectors do
not investigate offences of a criminal nature. They investigate events of a
commercial or financial nature, in the course of which they are very likely
to uncover criminality on the part of one or more of the actors in the
events under investigation.
The inspectors' task is quintessentially inquisitorial; and the task
partakes of none of the aspects of the criminal process which is designed to
protect the accused from any oppressive action by criminal investigator or
prosecutor. Inquisitions are by design held unremittingly to discover the
truth. The English criminal trial, on the other hand, is a restricted method
to determine the guilt or innocence of an accused according to a high
standard of proof. The trial process is the semblance of truth, or at least
may only approximate to the truth.
If the inspectors had nevertheless to caution a witness according to a
well-recognised formula before asking any questions, or advise that he or
she need not answer a question thought to incriminate the witness, it would
place an absurd restriction on the ability of the inspectors to uncover all
the relevant information.
Indeed, it may even be necessary for inspectors to withhold information from
a witness until the questioning takes place, or to confront a witness with a
highly material document for the first time during the questioning. Such
tactics would be regarded as highly irregular in a criminal trial.
Inspectors normally try to be fair to witnesses, but in the final analysis
their duty is to extract the optimum information and report their findings.
Mr Seelig and Lord Spens had asserted that there had been a conspiracy
between the inspectors, the DTI, the Serious Fraud Office and police
officers that the inspectors would use their statutory powers for an
ulterior purpose - namely, to build up a case for preferring criminal
charges and not for the purpose of investigating company affairs.
Two years ago such a danger was recognised by providing that where evidence
of a crime had been uncovered and referred to the prosecuting authority, the
minister could discontinue the inspectors' investigation. But those who have
to undergo the probing questions of inspectors will doubtless feel that the
exercise smacks of a preparation for criminal proceedings. Since criminal
charges, not infrequently, do follow these inspectors' reports, such
reaction of those investigated is not unreasonable. It all seems unfair.
Any unfairness in the procedure is publicly tolerable, indeed necessary in
the cause of finding the truth. What becomes less tolerable is the
publication of the inspectors' report - always held up pending any criminal
proceedings - because the individuals may be revealed for their commercial
irresponsibility, if not also for their criminality. Mr Robert Maxwell, the
publisher, smarted under the public condemnation of his behaviour as a
director over the affairs of Pergamon in the 1970s.
It is a common feature of public inquiries generally that prospective
witnesses are encouraged to come forward by promises that they will be given
immunity in respect of their testimony. The attorney-general then declares
that evidence before the inquiry will not be used in any subsequent criminal
proceedings.
Something akin to that concession would be appropriate for investigations by
DTI inspectors. There is even a case for treating the investigation, with
its draconian powers, and the public report that follows as a substitute for
a criminal trial, leaving it to stockholders or creditors to take
proceedings. But that would require an even more sophisticated approach to
the dubious value of criminal justice, as opposed to a searching public
inquiry and civil action, in unravelling complex financial dealings.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Money Markets: D-Mark stays weak
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE D-MARK traded among the weaker members of the European exchange rate
mechanism last week, despite its slight improvement against the dollar and
Japanese yen.
Currency trading was subdued, with the early part of the month lacking much
important economic news. There were no data on the UK or Japanese economies
and the only US figure of any significance was Friday's producer price index
for April.
Economic news from Germany was not encouraging, increasing the risk that
there will be a current account deficit in 1991, after last year's surplus
of DM75.5bn. The unified Germany has not yet managed a monthly surplus so
far this year. In March the current account shortfall was a substantial
DM5.3bn, compared with DM1.5bn in February.
A deficit of around DM3.5bn was expected, but payments for the Gulf war
increased the figure. A trade surplus of only DM2.8bn, against a forecast of
about DM3.5bn, was perhaps more worrying.
The size of the problem can be gauged by the fact that the old West Germany
had a current account surplus of DM12.2bn and a trade surplus of DM13.8bn in
March last year.
In the first three months of this year the German current account deficit
was DM8.9bn. Demand for goods in the east has sucked in imports and led to a
fall in exports, as West German industry has struggled to meet demand.
Imports rose 14 per cent to DM159.0bn in the first quarter, compared with a
year ago, while exports fell 6.6 per cent to DM165.8bn.
This state of affairs, coupled with rising inflation and political
instability in eastern Europe is not likely to improve the D-Mark's appeal,
particularly if the Bundesbank continues to resist the temptation to raise
interest rates.

FT  13 MAY 91 / International Bonds: Dealers slow to appreciate benefits of
rechristening
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Association of Inter-national Bond Dealers is to meet for the last time
later this week.
At its annual conference in Hong Kong, the regulatory body of the Eurobond
market will be reconstituted under a new name which better reflects its
broadening constituency.
The change marks a shift in direction as the AIBD leaves behind its roots as
a trade association and espouses broader issues.
However the move to re-christen the AIBD has met surprising resistance,
considering the disadvantages of a name which, in the minds of many market
participants, still stands for the Association of International Beer
Drinkers.
The proposal to change the name to the International Capital Market
Association met with disapproval from nostalgic traders unwilling to see the
organisation move away from its traditional base.
The AIBD's leadership, however, sees the need for the association, which has
already developed from a trade association to a regulatory bond, to evolve.
The similarity between the pronunciation of IPMA and ICMA prompted some
disquiet at the International Primary Market Association, the trade
association of the new issues market which broke away from the AIBD in the
mid-1980s. Some market participants feel there is no longer a separate role
for IPMA, and the two trade associations should band together.
In that case, issues such as the payment of lead management commissions
could be discussed and resolved in the context of a more powerful body.
However, a potential merger between the two groups still seems to be a long
way off, and political interests may forestall any such development.
There have been no discussions between the two bodies, even though many
members are in both, and might favour a streamlining.
The proposal to rename the organisation ICMA also met some objections from
foreign members who felt that 'capital' might be misunderstood.
Consequently, the proposed name has been changed to the International
Securities Market Association (ISMA), which was felt to be both sufficiently
broad and accurate.
'The name (AIBD) no longer truly represents our members, a lot of whom have
taken on several other functions (apart from dealing),' said Mr John
Langton, the AIBD's chief executive.
As well as the handful of statute changes (including the name issue) due to
be discussed at the meeting, a number of issues not on the official agenda
are likely to arise.
Under an amendment to the directive proposed by the French, Eurobond
transactions would have to be traded on regulated exchanges, and more
extensive price and volume reporting would be required.
Although all UK and some European firms report their trades to the AIBD, the
association would not be recognised as an exchange.
The AIBD has been actively lobbying the EC to prevent such a development,
but a stalemate appears to have been reached.
The argument advanced by the French, that off-exchange trading means
inadequate investor protection, is strongly rejected by the AIBD, which, as
a designated investment exchange under UK law, has been fighting to have its
statues and rule book recognised.
The AIBD is concerned that forcing all trades on to regulated exchanges will
limit cross border trading and reduce liquidity.
At the moment, something of an impasse appears to have been reached, with
the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, on one side, and the rest of
the community, led by France, on the other.
However, the AIBD is optimistic that it will succeed in persuading the EC to
accept its statutes and rules as fair and equitable. The next step would be
to try to obtain regulatory status, Mr Langton said.
The dispute over settlement procedures between the two European clearing
systems, Euroclear and Cedel, is also likely to resurface, even though most
market participants say they have 'learnt to live with it'.
Hopes have again been raised that agreement is near after an AIBD market
practices committee last week and a number of meetings between the three
parties (with the AIBD acting as a go-between).
'Euroclear has made a number of concessions and Cedel has respected those
and made some concessions too,' said Mr Langton, who added that there was
'an excellent chance' the problem would be resolved during this week's
meeting.
Last year, the two clearing systems agreed to renegotiate their 10-year-old
bridge agreement, widening the issue at stake from an original contention
about primary market settlement.
The bridge between the clearers is the mechanism by which settlement
information is exchanged and is generally agreed to have become outdated.
A memorandum of understanding was signed last September.
In October, Cedel put forward a proposal incorporating the need for multiple
exchange of files. Then in December, Euroclear put detailed proposals to
Cedel which included a commitment to incorporate multiple exchange of files,
seen as an important concession by Euroclear.
One issue which has never failed to spark complaints in the AIBD's 23-year
history is that of subscription rates.
Under a proposed statute change, the flat fee, currently SFr6,000, would be
substituted for a set range of SFr7,500 to SFr10,000.
The change is part of an attempt to improve the limitation of liability of
individual members to claims against the association by limiting liability
to the annual subscription rate. However fees have frequently been a
contentious issue, last leading to strong objections at the AIBD's Dallas
meeting in 1988, when members complained they were subsidising the
development of Trax, the AIBD's screen-based reporting system.
Because the AIBD has a strong UK membership, and is a self-regulatory body
under UK law, continental European members have often complained they were
financing UK members' compliance with UK regulations.
Now that Trax is running, and the commercial operations of the AIBD are
generating funds, there may be resistance to any increase in fees. But for
most leading firms, the costs involved are not significant.
The issue of cost has also arisen in the context of the meeting's location
in Hong Kong this year.
Some dealers said it made the conference too time-consuming and too
expensive.
Indeed, fears that a quorum might not be met have prompted proposals to
increase the number of proxies.
However, the choice of a more expensive location - along with some more
important issues - have helped encourage firms to send more senior
executives, while in previous years, junior traders without the authority to
make decisions were sometimes sent.
Discussions about any move towards live screen prices are unlikely to
advance.
Although this is felt to be a likely development in the longer term, the
daily feeds which the AIBD provides seem to be considered satisfactory.
The expense and the complexity of developing live screen prices in Eurobonds
are a deterrent, but such a shift also runs counter to some strong vested
interests within the Eurobond market.
Some banks feel their ability to trade profitably would be compromised by
too much transparency.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Syndicated Loans: Scandinavian deals dominate activity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCANDINAVIAN borrowers dominated the syndicated loans market last week with
a flood of deals intended to refinance short-term debt and provide
medium-term financing.
Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken - the largest commercial bank in Sweden, and
the bank affiliated to the Wallenberg family - last week launched a SKr9bn
acquisition finance facility for Patricia, the Wallenberg family's
fund-raising arm.
The facility will be used specifically to help finance the acquisition of
shares in Saab-Scania, the motor and aerospace group. Investor and
Providentia, the two Swedish investment companies controlled by the
Wallenberg family which jointly own Patricia, made a SKr12.8bn takeover bid
for outstanding shares in Saab-Scania in February.
SEB Capital Markets is agent and arranger for the facility, which is being
placed with a group of key relationship banks, both international and
domestic. These are thought to include J. P. Morgan, Citicorp, Manufacturers
Hanover, NatWest, Credit Lyonnais, Deutsche Bank and Swiss Bank Corporation
among others, although no commitments are in place yet.
The deal has an interesting structure because the loan will be available in
tranches of different maturities - namely nine months, two years and five
years. The pricing ranges from 85 basis points over the London interbank
offered rate (Libor) to over 100 basis points.
The facility will be guaranteed by Investor and Providentia and follows a
three-year, Dollars 1.1bn acquisition finance facility for Patricia arranged
by SEB earlier this year. Standard &amp; Poor's, the international credit-rating
service, said last week that Patricia's A-1 commercial paper rating would be
upheld. The rating had been placed on CreditWatch in February following the
SKr12.8bn takeover bid for Saab-Scania.
Separately, SEB Capital Markets launched a Dollars 250m five-year facility
last week for Trelleborg, the Swedish mining and industrial conglomerate.
The facility consists of a Dollars 200m term loan and Dollars 50m revolving
credit facility.
Bankers consider the pricing - of 50 basis points over Libor for the first
three years, and 55 basis points over Libor thereafter - generous.
The Dollars 1.36bn syndicated loan arranged for Stora, the Swedish pulp and
paper group, by SEB Capital Markets was signed last week. The five-year
revolving credit and term loan facility was oversubscribed, raising Dollars
1.7bn, so the 22 participating banks have had their contributions scaled
back accordingly.
The loan is intended to refinance Stora's short-term debt, mainly stemming
from the acquisition last year of Feldmuhle Nobel, the German forestry and
engineering group.
Manufacturers Hanover launched a three-year Dollars 60m syndicated revolving
credit facility for Ratos, the Swedish investment company which has big
shareholdings in companies such as Esselte, Asea, Stora and Industrivarden.
Ratos plans to expand its international activities and is using the facility
as a back-up for its Eurocommercial paper programme.
The interest margin is 55 basis points over Libor, but fees are not being
disclosed.
Manufacturers Hanover and Den Norske Bank are joint arrangers for a Dollars
60m secured five-year loan for Helikopter Service, the Norwegian group which
is Europe's second largest commercial helicopter service and flies workers
to North Sea oil platforms. The loan, in limited syndication, will help
finance the purchase of helicopters as well as the refinancing of two
existing facilities.

FT  13 MAY 91 / UK Gilts: Market looks ahead to bleak signs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GILTS market is looking ahead to a week of bleak news about the extent
of the UK recession.
The government is likely to announce on Thursday a large rise in
unemployment and a further slump in manufacturing production. A day after
this comes the latest information on inflation, as measured by the retail
price index, which is expected to show that the annual rate of increase was
just over 6 per cent last month, from 8.2 per cent in March.
Whether the government will use the latest economic indicators as an
opportunity to make a further cut in base rates, now at 12 per cent, is
hotly contested.
The Bank of England has already made its views known. Mr Robin
Leigh-Pemberton, the Bank governor, issued a thinly veiled warning last week
about the dangers of cutting interest rates too quickly.
The Bank is especially worried about underlying inflation - usually measured
by the RPI, less the effects of the poll tax and mortgage payments - which
is falling far less rapidly than the 'headline' rate.
According to this argument, the expected fall in the RPI is explained more
by technical factors, related to changes in the poll tax and interest rates,
than by continued signs of demand being squeezed due to recessionary forces.
Mr Leigh-Pemberton's statement was followed on Friday by the Bank lending to
the money market at the prevailing base rate of 12 per cent for two weeks -
a move which underlined the Bank's view that an imminent cut in rates would
be inappropriate.
Despite the Bank's signals, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has the final
say over monetary policy.
He may feel that recessionary conditions are so tough that a  1/2 percentage
point cut is justified - as part of the series of moves which have brought
base rates down by 2 percentage points since February. Even more to the
point, a cut in rates this week might help the Conservatives' chances of
winning the general election, which could be held later this year.
In the gilts market, the expectation is that Mr Lamont will cut rates soon.
This sentiment helped to bring down yields at the short end of the market
over the past week, while those for long-dated gilts stayed virtually static
in lacklustre trading. In deference to the Bank's views, some believe Mr
Lamont may make his announcement not on Friday, at the time of the RPI
figures, but a few days later.
If Bank officials are looking forward to this week's events with a certain
grim foreboding, they are probably glad to have last week out of the way.
What had been an embarrassment to the Bank - a tranche of Pounds 800m-worth
of 9 per cent Treasury stock maturing in 2008 which had remained unsold for
a month - was disposed of last Wednesday by the straightforward move of
cutting the price by 2 points.
The manoeuvre led to sniping by some gilt specialists, who reckoned the
market-makers buying the securities gained too much of a bargain. Some
eyebrows were raised because the Bank sold the stock at a price of 1/16 less
than the market price. This discrepancy meant the Bank (and ultimately the
taxpayer) gained from the transaction some Pounds 500,000 less than it would
have done by selling at the market price.
However, to show that it was not put off by the episode, the Bank announced
on Friday the sale of Pounds 200m-worth of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked stock
 -one segment worth Pounds 100m carrying a maturity in 2001 and the rest due
in 2011. The securities, available for dealing from today, should be far
easier to sell and should make last week's headaches for the Bank seem like
a bad dream.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Italian Government Bonds: Sentiment strong despite
government action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ITALIAN government bond market appears to have performed impressively
this year in spite of, rather than because of, the actions of government.
The cabinet crisis in April which forced the formation of Italy's 50th
post-war government has threatened to delay several important bond market
reforms, including procedures for reclaiming 12.5 per cent withholding tax
paid by overseas buyers.
Perhaps more seriously, the formation of a four-party coalition had delayed
agreement on spending cuts designed to rein in this year's budget deficit.
This weekend, however, the new cabinet agreed a budget package to bring the
deficit back to the target of L132,000bn, or 10 per cent of gross national
product.
Before the cabinet agreement, bond yields had continued to fall. The first
10-year government bond issue launched in February at a net yield of 12.64
per cent currently yields around 11.6 per cent, 10 basis points lower than
at the end of April. Analysts say lower yields stem from consistent overseas
buying of Italian government paper. As in other higher-yielding markets such
as Spain, international buying has been based on the view that exchange rate
co-operation will force yields down to the level of the lowest-yielding
market in the European monetary system - Germany.
'A lot of international fund managers have accepted the idea of convergence
of European bond markets and are shopping around for bargains,' said one
London-based money manager. 'Fixed-income investors have taken to behaving
like equity investors.'
The inflow of foreign funds into Italy has meant an easing of short-term
interest rates, with three-month money rates falling from 11 3/8 per cent in
late April to 10 7/8 per cent last week. Yesterday the Bank of Italy cut the
discount rate by one percentage point to 11.5 per cent, effective today.
Overseas buying has also been in evidence in the Eurobond market, where
borrowers such as Volkswagen, Barclays Bank and Credit Local de France, have
tapped international demand for Lira-denominated securities.
The Euro-lira sector has been dominated by supranational borrowers such as
the European Investment Bank and the World Bank. Italian investors do not
pay withholding tax on bonds issued by these agencies.
The Italian currency has rewarded the faith of international investors by
remaining strong, within the limits of its 2.25 per cent divergence limit
against the D-Mark. The lira is the second strongest currency within the
European exchange rate mechanism, after the peseta. From L760 against the
D-Mark at the beginning of 1990, the Italian currency now stands at around
L740.
However, dealers suggest this buoyant mood is fragile. It has been spurred
by the anticipation that tax barriers to international investment will be
dismantled. Delay could turn sentiment.
Equally, convergence of European bond markets depends on economic and
monetary integration. Any hint that Italy will not play a full role in the
next stage could leave the government bond market exposed.
Italy's record of economic management has been criticised by the
International Monetary Fund and the Bundesbank. Hence agreement on the
package of spending cuts by the cabinet could be crucial to sustaining the
confidence of bond market investors.

FT  13 MAY 91 / US Money and Credit: Delayed reaction to poor refunding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CURIOUS performance of the US bond markets on Friday afternoon was a
little like that of a tightrope walker who successfully crosses the high
wire, but then slips and falls at the far end from pent-up fright.
And the main reason for the market's sudden fall - the poor reception for
the US Treasury's quarterly refunding - could continue to reverberate for
quite a time yet.
Four-fifths of the way through last week the credit markets were breathing a
collective sigh of relief. The Treasury's record Dollars 37bn refunding on
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday was hardly a runaway hit, but at least it
had not spooked the bond market.
Calm seemed to prevail, despite the fact that Thursday's auction of 30-year
bonds attracted the smallest amount of bids since these securities were
first offered to the market on a regular basis in the 1970s. There was only
Dollars 1.41 in bids for every dollar of the Dollars 11.75bn on offer.
And, while the average yield on the bonds sold was 8.21 per cent, in line
with the market's expectations, there was a particularly large 'tail' - the
difference between the average and highest bid  - of three basis points.
That indicated dealers had widely different views of the value of the paper.
Why did this news not send prices plunging immediately?
One reason was that the market was anticipating good figures on inflation on
Friday, which it duly got: the producer price index rose only 0.2 per cent
in April, in line with expectations, in a further demonstration that the
recession is putting the squeeze on inflation - though the bond market is
reluctant to accept this.
When this good news failed to attract fresh buying, however, the initial
relief that the Treasury refunding was over turned to concern over the poor
reception received by the long bond, and prices began to tumble as dealers
tried to cut their inventory ahead of the weekend.
The fall was intensified by a rumour that Californian insurance regulators,
who on Friday clamped strong controls on a troubled insurer, First Capital
Life, were also demanding that it liquidate its junk and investment grade
bond portfolios. The upshot was that the new benchmark long bond closed the
week at 97 7/8 , compared with 99 1/16 in the auction, while the yield rose
from 8.21 to 8.31.
Both factors underline the market's concern about an oversupply of paper,
and this source of anxiety is not about to go away. The Federal government
is anticipating borrowing needs of some Dollars 115bn in the third quarter,
and estimates of its requirements from now to the end of September range as
high as Dollars 155bn. That could cause a lot of indigestion.
However the position may not be quite as bleak as it first appears. Ms
Kathleen Stephansen of securities firm Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette points
out that some Dollars 70bn of this may be earmarked to support the
Resolution Trust, which is cleaning up the savings and loans mess, and the
trust may not be able to use that amount in so short a time. Furthermore,
money borrowed for the thrift bail-out does not increase overall demand for
credit and does not stimulate aggregate demand.
Even so, the government's funding requirements could prove even bigger than
now forecast if the economy does not start soon showing signs of an upturn,
which would boost its tax receipts.
The recent spate of economic indicators has been thoroughly confusing. The
optimists - and they include most Wall Street analysts  - insist this is yet
another sign that the US is approaching an economic turning point, as the
downward movement of the last 10 months reaches the bottom of the trough.
However, as yet there have been few signs of an upturn in industry's order
books. The key automotive sector remains flat on its back, and there is some
fear the consumer-led downturn may now be followed by a sizeable drop in
business expenditure.
Another potentially worrying sign is the slow growth in money supply that
re-appeared in April, although this could have been a seasonal freak.
There will be more clues on Monday and Tuesday, with the release of data on
industrial production, retail sales and consumer price inflation in April.
And the Federal Reserve's policy-making Open Markets Committee will have
these on hand on Tuesday when it meets to consider monetary policy.
Unless the newly released figures - or the Fed's own preliminary money
supply growth statistics for early May - are dreadful, the central bank
seems unlikely to change its policy, which took the Fed funds rate down to 5
3/4 per cent at the end of April.

NORTHWEST Airlines, the US carrier taken private via a leveraged buy-out,
has reported a Dollars 62m loss after tax in the first quarter of 1991,
writes Nikki Tait in New York.
This compared with a Dollars 39m deficit in the same period a year earlier.
The loss was scored on revenues almost static at Dollars 1.64bn.
Like most of its rivals, Northwest blamed the losses on the effects of the
Gulf war and depressed domestic demand.
Operating costs rose to Dollars 1.76bn, from Dollars 1.72bn.

FT  13 MAY 91 / International Company News: Shearson faces losses after
Dollars 144m charge for quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHEARSON Lehman Brothers, the investment banking subsidiary of American
Express, is to take a Dollars 144m pre-tax charge against second-quarter
earnings because of a clampdown last Friday by California's insurance
regulators on a troubled life company in which Shearson holds a large stake.
Analysts expect the write-down to push Shearson into the red, despite the
markets boom which has been boosting Wall Street profits this year. The
brokerage made Dollars 51m in the first quarter.
The losses will also lower the profits of American Express, which faced
severe problems with Shearson in early 1990, when it was forced to inject
hundreds of millions of dollars into the business following a Dollars 915m
loss.
Mr John Garamendi, the recently appointed Californian insurance
commissioner, issued a 'cease and desist' order on Friday against First
Capital Life Insurance, a San Diego-based company whose parent, First
Capital Holdings, is 28 per cent owned by Shearson.
The previous week First Capital Life had faced a flood of customers seeking
to cash in their policies amid reports the company - which has a large
exposure to the junk bond market - faced severe financial problems.
The commissioner's move prevents the company from writing new business or
making payments to its parent, and places a moratorium on policy surrenders
and life insurance policy loans.
The commissioner is seeking longer term solutions to the company's problems,
which could include asset sales and a capital infusion.
Unfounded rumours on Friday that the company had begun selling off its junk
bond portfolio contributed to a sharp afternoon decline in bond prices and a
sympathetic drop in equity markets, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average
losing 50.98 points on the day.
Shearson's write-down covers all its investment in First Capital Holding.
However, Wall Street analysts say the brokerage house could face further
losses if it had to compensate those holders of First Capital policies who
brought them through Shearson.
Shearson, however, says it believes the insurer has 'the resources to meet
at least the principal payments of policyholders' and it is not in a
position to make any open-ended commitments to them. The company has also
been resisting the commissioner's appeals for it to inject fresh money into
First Capital.

FT  13 MAY 91 / International Company News: Germans plan Europe rating
agency

<TEXT>
A GERMAN initiative to develop a new European rating agency is soon to be
promoted in other European countries. The aim is to create an entity which
will cater for local investors' needs in the single market.
Although several small rating agencies already exist in other European
countries, the Germans are keen to develop a single Europe-wide institution,
or at least to harmonise standards across a federation of agencies.
A group of some 20 German companies and institutions, principally inspired
by Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank, are poised to set up a project
company which will put the concept to a wider audience, including the French
Italians and Britons.
Those ratings ascribed to debt instruments alert investors to grades of
risks and to changes in those risks. While the process has been less crucial
to the European capital markets than those in America, the two big US
agencies, Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's, have established a significant
presence in Europe.
Moody's, for instance, claims to rate around 78 per cent of the outstandings
in the Euro D-Mark bond market.
Promoters of the new agency believe that, while the US agencies provide a
highly efficient service for large corporations selling their debt to global
investors, they do not have the capacity to analyse medium-sized companies
in Europe targeting a more specialised investor interest.
The Germans also argue that the American agencies are driven by US
accounting principles and focus on short-term performance criteria that are
less relevant for Europe.
The group points out that the growth of capital market borrowing instruments
reduces companies' dependence on bank-financed debt, which in turn increases
the importance of ratings.
The new agency should allow less well-known companies to reach new investors
anywhere in Europe, through the common language of a simple debt
classification. Commercial paper, medium-term notes, and multi-currency
bonds would all be candidates for ratings, according to working party
outlines.
German interest in the project has been spurred by the recent development of
a D-Mark commercial paper market, permitted since the beginning of the year.
It already has outstandings of around DM1bn, issued by only a handful of
borrowers.

FT  13 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Palma drops dividend on Pounds 2m losses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LOSSES HAVE deepened at Palma Group, the Leicester-based textile company, in
the 13 months to January 31.
From a deficit of Pounds 246,000 in the year 1989, the group declined to
losses of Pounds 2m pre-tax. This came on turnover down at Pounds 29.93m
(Pounds 31.98m), though continuing activities contributed Pounds 18.04m
(Pounds 17.75m).
Mr Peter Bailey, chairman, said that 'in a very tough period, trading
conditions were as bad as at any time' in the board's memory. At the outset
there was low demand and it had deteriorated further. The result was
affected by an exceptional provision of Pounds 240,000 (nil) for
reorganisation at Pex, and increased interest of Pounds 1.56m (Pounds
707,000).
Losses per share totalled 7.97p (0.83p) and the dividend is passed. The
total payout last time was 3.7p.
During the 13 months, the Montfort Somercotes subsidiary was closed, and
certain of the Clothkits mail order assets and its name were sold to
Freemans, the catalogue operation.

FT  13 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Racal demerger plans face delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DETAILED plans for the demerger of Racal Electronics, which Sir Ernest
Harrison, the UK electronics group's chairman is due to announce with the
interim results in June, may not be fulfilled before next year.
With less than a month until the plan is to be presented to shareholders,
Racal has still not appointed new non-executive directors who will need to
decide what to do with Racal Electronics' Pounds 375m of debt ahead of the
proposed flotation of Racal Chubb.
Sir Ernest is expected to announce on June 12 the timing of the first stage
of the demerger - the hand-out to shareholders of Racal Electronics' 80 per
cent share in Racal Telecom, the subsidiary that operates Vodafone, the
world's largest cellular radio telephone network.
But before the proposed flotation of Chubb, Racal's wholly owned security
subsidiary, new non-executive directors will have to scrutinise how much of
the debt should be left with the 'rump' of Racal Electronics.
Last November, when Sir Ernest announced he would break up Racal after what
he said was the market's persistent under-valuation of the group, he
promised to appoint independent directors early in the new year.
Sir Ernest has said he will lead a management buy-out team once the
slimmed-down Racal Electronics had traded for an appropriate time in the
market.
The amount of debt carried by the slimmed down Racal Electronics would have
a bearing both on how easily Sir Ernest could find MBO finance and the
financial return for the MBO team, analysts say.
Racal Telecom already has a quotation and would not be encumbered by any of
its parent's debt. As a result, the first stage of Sir Ernest's plan would
not require the scrutiny of new independent directors, analysts say.
Racal Electronics and its advisers, NM Rothschild, have been talking to
potential new non-executive directors and are expected to announce the new
appointments no later than June.

FT  13 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Radio Clyde falls 42%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RADIO CLYDE Holdings, the Glasgow-based commercial radio company that
recently merged with Radio Forth, was hit by a slump in national advertising
in the first half of the year.
Pre-tax profit fell by nearly 42 per cent to Pounds 700,000 (Pounds 1.2m) on
turnover down 26 per cent to Pounds 3.46m (Pounds 4.68m) in the six months
to March 31. National advertising revenue fell by 39 per cent, whereas the
local decline was only 5 per cent.
At the half-way stage, Clyde had Pounds 3m cash and had earned Pounds
220,000 (Pounds 180,000) in interest. Mr John Bowman, finance director, said
the war chest was still intact after the all-share Radio Forth deal. The
group's ambitions for growth extended to local radio south of the border as
well as to a possible bid for the first national commercial station.
It has taken a 40 per cent stake in Buzz FM a new statio in Birmingham, and
increased its stake in Satellite Media Services to 28.6 per cent.
Earnings per share fell to 7.3p (12.2p). The interim dividend is held at
3.25p, but cost goes up to Pounds 291,000 (Pounds 205,000) because of
payments to former holders of Forth shares.

FT  13 MAY 91 / UK Company News: CRS hits Pounds 45m and lifts market share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLARE PEARSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CO-OPERATIVE Retail Services achieved a 14 per cent increase in trading
surplus to Pounds 44.9m for the year to January 26, despite depressed
conditions in its sector.
Mr Harry Moore, chief executive of the UK's largest retail co-operative
society, added that CRS had taken market share from competitors as net sales
moved ahead by 11 per cent to Pounds 1.29bn (Pounds 1.16bn).
In particular, he highlighted the performance of the non-food division where
sales had risen by 14 per cent to Pounds 191m and trading surplus by 34 per
cent. Home furnishing and electrical goods had especially defied national
trends.
Mr Moore thought the non-food division, which aimed to sell middle-market
products, had benefited during the recession as customers focused on
achieving value for money.
On the non-food side, CRS claimed it was the UK's fifth largest department
store operator with 49 shops, many of which have adopted the Living format,
and 11 specialised stores including five Homeworld outlets.
However, the society's dominant activity is in food retailing, where it
claims at least 3.5 per cent of the UK grocery market with 480 outlets.
These include about 100 Leo's out-of-town superstores as well as the more
traditional Stop &amp; Shop corner shops. Both have a strong emphasis on price.
Purchase of the Cambridge Society last October helped boost sales of the
division which rose by 12.5 per cent to Pounds 944m. On a like-for-like
basis, they would have increased by nearly 11 per cent. There was a 13.5 per
cent rise in trading surplus.
The inclusion of Cambridge's borrowings was a factor behind a sharp increase
in CRS's net interest payments to Pounds 14.31m (Pounds 10.04m). Operating
surplus, struck after payments of interest on CRS's shares and grants and
donations, fell to Pounds 19.91m (Pounds 20.04m). The retained surplus was
Pounds 22.61m (Pounds 23.35m).
A change in CRS's constitution later this month will alter substantially its
relationship with the Co-operative Wholesale Society. This follows the
abandonment of merger talks last summer.

FT  13 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Logitek says yes to Microvitec
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOGITEK, the computer services group, has finally agreed to a revised offer
from Microvitec, the computer peripherals maker from which it had been
fighting off a hostile takeover bid.
Logitek is recommending a new and higher offer by Microvitec of 20 Logitek
shares for 21 Microvitec shares, which values the company at approximately
Pounds 3.5m. This compares with the one-for-one all share offer which valued
Logitek at Pounds 3.3m.
Microvitec had already acquired or agreed to acquire 22.5 per cent of
Logitek's ordinary capital. The agreement ends Microvitec's one and a half
month struggle for Logitek through which it sought to create an enlarged
group andturn round its flagging fortunes.
'Unless you're small and innovative and keep coming out with super products,
to have any chance of survival in the electronics industry you've got to
have size,' says Mr James Bailey, the chairman of Microvitec.
'With the Logitek deal going through, we can expect 1992 to be a super
year,' he added.
Microvitec was not as fortunate in its bid to raise approximately Pounds
2.56m through a rights issue of 14.4m new ordinary shares to help fund the
acquisition.
The issue, while fully underwritten, closed with only 6.22 per cent of
acceptances.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR CHRISTOPHER Stewart Smith is resigning as chairman of Conder, the
Winchester-based construction and property group which last month announced
it had fallen deeply into loss in 1990.
Mr Michael Pelham, managing director, also plans to resign from the board at
the annual meeting next month.
Mr Stewart Smith, a former director of P&amp;O who took over as chairman of
Conder in 1987, is to remain as a director until a replacement non-executive
chairman is appointed.
Mr Alan Lovell, finance director, takes over as acting chief executive.
The shares closed 3p lower on Friday at 46p.
Last month, Conder said it had been driven into a 1990 pre-tax loss of
Pounds 19.29m. Losses on curtain walling contracts for two City office
developments were at the heart of the fall. That came after a strong
performance in 1989 when pre-tax profits soared by 67 per cent to Pounds
10.42m.
Heavily geared at the last year-end, Conder has since sharply reduced
borrowings with the sale of properties and a forecourt services business.

FT  13 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Pounds 70m write-down at Ensign Trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP drop in the value of its unlisted investments resulted in a Pounds
69.7m write-down at the interim stage for Ensign Trust, which has recently
faced the possibility of being wound down by the Merchant Navy Officers
Pension Fund, its largest shareholder.
Net asset value per share at March 31 totalled 53.6p, a decline of 57.52p on
the 111.12p standing 12 months earlier
In addition to the write-down, which was equivalent to 23p per share, a
further write-down of Pounds 17.8m has been made in the unlisted investment
portfolio, equivalent to 5.9p per share.
For the half year to March 31 the trust reported a loss before tax of Pounds
58,000 compared with a profit of Pounds 75,000 previously. The Pounds 44,000
surplus available to shareholders in the previous half-year was reversed in
the revenue account to a deficit of Pounds 567,000.
Losses per ordinary share amounted to 0.19p (earnings 0.03p) and a
same-again interim dividend of 0.3p per share is being paid. However, the
board does not expect to recommend payment of a final dividend.
Borrowings increased by Pounds 26.23m to Pounds 118.18m (Pounds 91.94m).
The group is looking to gradually reduce the unquoted portfolio proportion
of its overall assets.
Disposals will be made with a view to receiving full value for the
investments, and the proceeds will go to reducing the level of its gearing,
it said.
The group warned that the loss of income from Argosy Asset Management,
formerly a wholly-owned subsidiary, would reduce future revenues. Argosy,
which was considered unable to continue to operate autonomously after it
lost its contract to manage the MNOPF's investment portfolio, was acquired
by Ivory &amp; Sime, which took over management of Ensign Trust's investments
from Argosy.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Pirelli treads a careful path on Continental: The latest
twist in the saga
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER and HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The man from Mercedes-Benz was astounded. A Pirelli manager had just offered
a big tyre price reduction, something the German luxury car company had
neither asked for nor expected.
With stories like this, it is no wonder some analysts say the tyre industry
almost seems to have a death wish. Tyre producers have indulged in an orgy
of price-slashing. This has depressed their own selling prices even further
at a time of crisis in the industry and left the car companies crowing with
delight.
As tyremakers' profits have been decimated, due both to the motor industry's
tough cost-cutting efforts and their own aggressive competition, car
producers have enjoyed price cuts of more than 20 per cent in the past year
or so. Adding to the tyre manufacturer's woes is the downturn in vehicle
sales in some European markets after the steep decline in the US. On new car
business, says Mr Philip Wylie, motor analyst with Salomon Brothers in
London, 'they're all losing money on each tyre they make'.
It is against this background that the latest, almost melodramatic, phase in
the tussle between Italy's Pirelli and Continental of Germany has been
played out. Having been rebuffed in its first attempt at merger talks,
Pirelli has succeeded in getting so-called 'round table' discussions under
way. And the man who so vigorously kept Pirelli at bay, Mr Horst Urban,
Continental's combative chief executive, has had to go.
His departure was announced on Friday. Mr Urban had initially found it easy,
helped by Morgan Grenfell, Continental's UK merchant bank adviser, to shoot
down Pirelli's suggested merger terms. These would have basically involved
Continental paying a high price to take over Pirelli's tyre assets, but then
ceding management control to Milan.
At this stage, it is anyone's guess what will happen. Clearly, a merger
looks far more likely, but it is still by no means a foregone conclusion.
Nor is it entirely apparent that an amalgamation would produce significant
benefits. Despite the big international takeovers in the tyre industry, such
as Japan's Bridgestone buying Firestone, and Michelin of France taking over
Uniroyal-Goodrich, the aggressive pricing tactics of the big manufacturers
continue. Michelin, which has announced big job cuts, is seen as one of the
top price-cutters.
'Competition has been stepped up another pace,' says Mr John Lawson, motor
analyst with Nomura Research in London. 'The US market is going from bad to
worse, so the timing of the acquisitions everyone has made there look
disastrous.' This obviously also includes Continental's own purchase of
General Tire, now feeling the brunt of the US automotive slump.
Pirelli's argument, which claims support from owners of more than 51 per
cent of Continental's shares - including 5 per cent in its own hands - is
that the need for a merger is strengthened by the crisis. It has outlined
big savings on production, marketing and development, as well as
geographical advantages. Continental has admitted savings could be made, but
disputes their size.
In the end, Mr Urban's uncompromising tone proved too discordant for the
supervisory board, which forced him out last week. His backing, even from
the labour representatives, dissolved as it apparently became clear that the
company, and the industry, was in a worse situation than he had portrayed it
 -especially in the viciously competitive US market. The feeling grew that
discussions with Pirelli should be pursued more constructively.
The head of the non-executive supervisory board is Mr Ulrich Weiss, an
executive of Deutsche Bank, which also owns Morgan Grenfell. At a
supervisory board meeting on the Friday before last he clashed with Mr Urban
 -embittered sources in Continental talk of provocation. Mr Urban told Mr
Weiss after the meeting that he would resign if the board did not support
him.
It was that issue which the board met to discuss in Hanover on Thursday.
Lining up with Mr Weiss was Mr Friedrich Schiefer, finance director and
chief executive-designate of the Allianz insurance group. Allianz holds 5
per cent of Continental's stock and is thought to be in the Pirelli camp.
They, it is believed, were joined by Mr Gunther Sassmannshausen, former head
of the Preussag steel and metals group, Mr Ernst Pieper, chief executive of
Preussag, and Mr Klaus Piltz, chairman of the Veba energy group.
Faced with such weighty opposition, Mr Urban agreed to go. He is succeeded
by 60-year old Mr Wilhelm Winterstein, six years older and generally seen as
an interim choice. Mr Winterstein, previously purchasing director, has been
in the tyre business for 35 years and is thought more likely to enter into
talks with Pirelli in a positive spirit.
In Milan, the Italian company has built a wall of silence around its
headquarters, saying nothing about where, when, or at what level these talks
will take place. The company is avoiding triumphalism - otherwise obvious in
the Italian press. But by stressing the need for 'the utmost
confidentiality' in the discussions with Continental, it is acknowledging
the delicate balance in Germany which has tipped the scales against Mr
Urban.
Thus, the traditionally taciturn Pirelli is more circumspect than ever for
fear of triggering an adverse reaction in Germany which might embarrass its
supporters there. The most sensitive issue is control of the combined tyres
operation, if a merger comes about.
Despite the strong trading links between Italy and Germany, Italian
companies are much less conspicuous in the German market than vice versa.
Not only does the short-termism often evident in Italy's business sector
clash with longer-range German practices, but Italian companies often face
severe image problems in Germany. Their relative absence there reflects the
tendency to concentrate on southern Europe and the immense difficulties
which Italian businessmen often have in finding high-quality German
managers.
Thus, apart from discussions on valuations and the structure of any merger,
control is likely to be the trickiest issue that Pirelli must address.
Nevertheless, its mood marks a sharp change from the bitter words of the
letter it issued to shareholders last February following the decision by
Continental's supervisory board not to pursue talks.
Pirelli referred angrily to the inconsistency of the response shown towards
its plans by 'the heads of some major German institutions'. Although these
were not named, the reference to Mr Weiss was unmistakeable. Pirelli claimed
that he initially 'gave his agreement and support' to its tyre merger
proposal. Deutsche Bank, in turn, accused Pirelli of acting in a way that
was 'misleading and thus likely to produce a false impression'.
That atmosphere of tit-for-tat accusations has now evaporated. But when the
final chapter of this saga is written, the position of Germany's biggest
bank - and the issue of bank-industry links and boardroom representation in
Germany in general - will warrant special attention. So will the need for
comprehensive, stringent takeover and share disclosure rules. For while the
Pirelli-Continental affair will not make bid-sensitive German executives
quake in their boots, it has added a fascinating but more uncertain
dimension to Germany's mergers and acquisitions scene.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Economics Notebook: Election fever haunts UK policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THESE are difficult days for knowing what is happening in the British
economy. But it is as good a time as any for evaluating the policy
priorities of Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor.
The UK's usual statistical fog is being compounded by political noise as
both leading parties appear determined to stay on election alert.
So far, the most obvious symptom of this double malaise has been Mr Lamont's
tendency to accentuate the positive side of UK economic developments in his
recent public statements.
But with pressure rising among Tory backbenchers and in financial markets
for another cut in British bank base rates from their current 12 per cent
level, there is a risk that the noise will direct economic policy and drive
a wedge between the Bank of England and the Treasury.
Signs of incipient tension emerged last week. In a lecture at Exeter
University, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the governor of the Bank of England,
underlined that the big fall in the retail prices index for April, which is
expected to be published on Friday, should not be interpreted as a sign that
underlying inflation is falling as sharply.
Using veiled 'central bank speak', Mr Leigh Pemberton voiced his own and the
Bank's belief that there should be a pause before base rates fall further,
following their 2 percentage point drop from 14 per cent in the two months
between mid-February and mid-April. Last Friday, the Bank hammered home this
message in its money market operations by lending Pounds 965m at the base
rate level of 12 per cent for 14 days.
Throughout last week, however, financial markets chose to believe that
interest rates would fall soon. The domestic money market betted heavily
that Friday's big RPI drop would be the occasion for another 0.5 percentage
point base rate cut. It was encouraged by the expectation that the annual
rate of RPI inflation in April will have fallen to about 6 per cent from 8.2
per cent in March as the impact of last year's poll tax bills drops out of
the index. The Nationwide Anglia Building Society last week pre-empted such
a move by cutting its mortgage rates by 0.7 per cent.
Until recently, the Treasury and Bank appeared equally concerned about
underlying inflation. It is probably still the case that Treasury officials
would like some delay in the downward movement of interest rates to evaluate
the economic effects of the cuts already made.
But it is also possible to detect some difference in tone over monetary
policy between the Bank and Treasury. The Treasury's reaction to last week's
developments was muted. While the Bank was sticking its neck out against an
interest rate cut, officials in Whitehall said the Treasury was 'agnostic'
over whether conditions would soon be right for a base rate move.
All of which brings us back to Mr Lamont. He earned a reputation as an iron
chancellor in his early months in Number 11 Downing Street, as he carried
out the tough counter-inflationary policy that his predecessor, Mr John
Major, summed up with the words: 'If it isn't hurting, it isn't working.'
But Mr Lamont sang a different tune when in Washington last month for the
spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. Then the
talk was of recovery 'round the corner' as he forecast that Britain would
reduce its inflation rate to near-European levels 'within a very short
period of time'.
The chancellor's comments about economic recovery came at a time when
Britain's economic statistics are more than usually confusing. His
confidence was based almost entirely on the latest quarterly survey of
industrial trends from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI). In
particular, he picked on the CBI's report of a partial recovery in business
optimism as a sign that forward-looking economic indicators were pointing
his way.
Since then, other surveys by the Institute of Directors and 3i, the
investment capital group, have indicated a revival of confidence among
businessmen. In addition, the Central Statistical Office's (CSO)
longer-leading cyclical indicator has turned sharply upwards since the
beginning of the year. It may be indicating a revival in the economy over
the next six months.
But the good news in all these indicators - including the CSO leading
indicator - is limited to measures of expectations and confidence.
Last week's newspaper headlines telling of job losses in companies such as
Rolls-Royce suggested that the economy is still in recession. This week's
indicators of economic activity, covering unemployment and industrial
production in April and March respectively, are unlikely to lift the gloom.
The City scents that Mr Lamont, in seeing recovery through the statistical
fog, has chosen to put as positive a gloss as possible on economic
developments for political reasons.
His statement that recovery was round the corner came just days before the
May 2 local government elections. If anything, the political pressure on the
chancellor to enhance the 'feel good' factor in the economy has increased
since then. Quite apart from excitement over a possible general election,
this Thursday sees another by-election test for the government in Monmouth -
which has been a safe Conservative seat.
For these reasons, some City analysts have suggested that the base rate cut
could come as early as Wednesday, when the Treasury should have its first
insight into the April RPI and conveniently ahead of the Monmouth vote.
Such a move is far from certain. It would be odd in view the Bank's firm
action on the money markets last week, but not unprecedented. It would also
have to be judged against the economic data that has still to be released
this week.
But with election fever running strongly, the chancellor may find it
difficult to square his political instincts with his job as custodian of the
nation's economic welfare.
Over the next few weeks, the electorate, financial markets and international
investors should be better able to judge whether Mr Lamont's first priority
is defeating inflation - as he has always professed - or whether he is more
anxious to secure victory for his party at the polls.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Liffe plan for lira futures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe) is developing a
futures contract on Italian government bonds. If plans to launch the
contract later this year go ahead, it will be the first futures contract
denominated in lira.
The exchange has completed a feasibility study, according to Mr Michael
Jenkins, Liffe's chief executive. 'Our aim is to have some sort of
co-operation with the Italian authorities,' he said.
The contract would be based on Buoni del Tesoro Poiennali (BTPs), domestic
government bonds of a type with maturities between four and 10 years.
The Italian government bond market is the third largest in the world, after
Japan and the US. However, it ranks much lower in turnover, as much of the
market is held by small domestic investors, and high proportions of
instruments are short-dated and floating-rate.
However, the Italian government has begun to extend the maturity profile of
its debt. Since the beginning of March, the government has issued L10,000bn
(Pounds 4.6bn) of 10-year BTPs in three tranches.
The Italian authorities also last month eased procedures for the reclaiming
of withholding tax for foreign investors. It is expected that the tax will
eventually be abolished.
The Italian bond market has attracted considerable overseas investment this
year, partly due to such measures.
Total turnover in BTPs is believed to be in the region of L3,000bn daily.
About 40 per cent of that business is believed to be conducted in London.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Brent Walker to unveil Pounds 1bn write-down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRENT WALKER, the heavily-borrowed UK leisure group, is expected to disclose
a write-down in the value of property and assets from Pounds 1.1bn, net of
debt, to about Pounds 100m when it announces its preliminary results for
1990 on Wednesday.
The disastrous figures have prompted some of the group's bankers, which are
collectively owed Pounds 1.4bn by Brent Walker, to talk privately of ousting
Mr George Walker, the chairman and chief executive, who engineered the
group's rapid rise in the 1980s.
But, according to a source close to the company, neither Mr Walker nor other
Brent Walker directors had heard from any bankers and the chairman had 'no
intention of stepping down'.
Mr Walker and Hill Samuel, the merchant bank, are planning to present
proposals for a financial restructuring to bankers, led by Standard
Chartered, after the preliminary results are announced.
It is understood that Brent Walker will propose to cut debt to almost Pounds
1bn by the year-end with asset sales. This could lead to the sale of the
Brighton marina, the Puerto Sherry marina in Spain, a 50 per cent share in
London's Trocadero, the retail, leisure and office complex, and hotels and
casinos.
The refinancing plan is also expected to propose that Brent Walker retains
the pub retailing division and William Hill, the profitable betting shop
chain it bought for Pounds 685m from Grand Metropolitan in 1989.
However, the banks are believed to be anxious about Mr Walker's desire to
keep William Hill. The chain is one of Brent Walker's most saleable assets.
Last autumn, the Bank of England was widely thought to have urged restraint
on Brent Walker's more hawkish bankers, amid an uncertain economic
atmosphere. The Bank is being kept informed of negotiations.
The banks demanded a financial restructuring as a condition of their
agreement last November, which froze capital repayments until the end of
this year.
Brent Walker's 1990 assets will exclude the Pounds 160m which it says it is
owed by Grand Metropolitan as a partial refund on the purchase price of
William Hill. Brent Walker demanded the refund because it said the chain's
profits were not as high as GrandMet had stated.
It withheld payment of a final Pounds 50m instalment on the purchase price
until the dispute over the Pounds 160m could be settled by arbitration. In
January, the High Court ruled that Brent Walker should pay the Pounds 50m.
It has not yet paid.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Managers cautious on US equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH institutional fund managers remain optimistic about the prospects
for UK and Japanese equities, but are becoming noticeably more cautious
about US stocks, a Gallup survey revealed yesterday.
A monthly poll of institutional investors produced by Gallup for the
securities group, Smith New Court, also found that fund managers intend to
increase their weighting in UK property and run down their holdings of cash.
It is widely believed that the British economy will improve over the next
year, with only 4 per cent expecting it to deteriorate further.
Base rates are forecast on average to fall to 10.3 per cent in a year's
time.
Investors are enthusiastic about the outlook for global equities over the
next year, with the FT-SE 100 index expected to rise from 2523 at the time
of polling last week, to a mean 2747, the Dow Jones Average from 2939 to
3113, and the Nikkei index from 26,478 to 29,064.
However, in the short term, investors appear to be taking a more cautious
view of the equity markets.
Bulls of the UK market over the next three months outnumbered bears by only
3 per cent. A balance of 22 per cent was bearish about the US market and 12
per cent more were bearish about the continental European markets.
The May survey covered 92 institutions handling funds totalling Pounds
380bn.

<TEXT>
Sir, With reference to Joe Rogaly's article on India ('Passage to India',
April 23) and the subsequent letter from Mr Pritam Singh (May 3), while
there may well be a good case for decentralisation in India, by giving more
powers to the states, this should not be confused with the aims of those
demanding secession.
Less centralisation could be good for India, but allowing secession of any
part of the country should not be encouraged. It would weaken India and
damage regional stability. Daljit Sehbai,

Sir, As the director of a small company that would not be in business
without the help my bank has given me over the years, I think that Mr F X
O'Malley (Letters, May 2) is wrong in suggesting that managers should visit
their customers.
Surely his time and that of his bank manager would be better employed by
making sure that he regularly updates his company's cash flow and any other
financial projections deemed necessary. From my experience, this should be
done at least once a month and the information then forwarded to the bank
manager for review. Far from being a subjective approach, this is the best
method I know for detecting problems at an early stage.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Letter: SQM - privatisation, investment and capital
expenditure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PATRICIO CONTESSE.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, On December 19 1990, the FT published an article which contained
several inaccuracies about Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile SA (SQM). We
would like to correct the most important errors.
SQM was privatised in 1988 with many shares being taken up by its employees.
SQM is therefore run for the benefit of not only its shareholders but also
its employees as employees are shareholders. Your article wrongly suggests
that employees were duped out of their shares in Pampa Calichera. The
correct position is that the shares of this company were purchased by
Sociedad de Inversiones Pampa Grande SA The purchase was made in order to
defeat a hostile and risky takeover bid mounted by foreign investor
competitors of SQM. The majority of the shares in Oro Blanco, Pampa Grande
and Pampa Calichera continue to be owned by employees of SQM and its
subsidiaries.
Over the past three years, SQM has made a significant investment of more
than Dollars 13m in building houses and in improving current housing
conditions of its employees in Maria Elena and Pedro de Valdivia. SQM's
employees earn on average between Dollars 600 and Dollars 700 a month. The
minimum monthly wage in Chile is about Dollars 75. Moreover, free housing,
water, electricity and schooling, together with subsidised health service
and transportation, are also provided to SQM's employees.
Although your article correctly records planned future expenditure of
Dollars 238m on plant improvements, it did not mention that since SQM's
plants were built in 1930 they have been constantly updated and modernised;
in the past three years alone more than Dollars 90m has been spent on plant
improvements. On average, SQM's plants are less than 10 years old.
SQM is a publicly listed company strictly controlled by the Chilean SEC,
with a well-known board of directors and with no political allegiance to
previous or current regimes in Chile.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Leading Article: Mr Lilley and competition
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Peter Lilley, the trade and industry secretary, has repeatedly emphasised
his commitment to free competition. However, the effectiveness of government
policies intended to promote that objective is blunted by a number of
anomalies and shortcomings. Mr Lilley should use his promised statement on
competition issues, due in the next two months, to set out a more coherent
approach.
His first priority should be to end the confusion created by his own
ill-judged efforts to tighten scrutiny of UK acquisitions by foreign
state-controlled bidders. The Monopolies and Mergers Commission has blocked
only one of the five such deals referred to it - and then chiefly on grounds
of market share. As Sir Gordon Borrie, director-general of the Office of
Fair Trading put it last week, the discrepancy between Mr Lilley's stance
and the MMC's findings has thrown merger policy into disarray.
The legality of Mr Lilley's position is also doubtful. The Rome Treaty
explicitly prohibits discrimination between private and publicly-owned
companies, and state control is not recognised as a criterion by the
European Community's merger policy, which takes precedence over national
regulations in controlling large deals. That is not to dismiss Mr Lilley's
underlying anxiety that state-owned companies enjoy unfair financial
advantages. But the sensible solution is to impose more transparency and
discipline on governments' dealings with nationalised industries, as EC
competition authorities are seeking to do.
New legislation
Britain also needs to align itself with EC practice by giving the OFT powers
against cartels comparable to those enjoyed by Brussels. At present, it is
difficult to curb UK restrictive trade practices unless they involve wider
Community interests. A White Paper proposing to correct this anomaly has
gathered dust for almost two years. Mr Lilley should commit himself to
introducing legislation in the next Parliament.
The biggest challenge, however, is to ensure the long-term consistency and
impartiality of competition policy. That can be assured only if it is
insulated from the unpredictable impact of short-run political influences.
As an outspoken critic of government intervention, Mr Lilley should
recognise the value of reforms to entrench that principle.
Strengthen OFT
The first should be to strengthen the role of the OFT, at present mainly an
adviser to government. It should be given at least as much autonomy as
regulators of privatised utilities, which are formally not part of Whitehall
and report directly to Parliament. Like them, the OFT should also have the
authority to refer cases to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
That power should, as a minimum, extend to mergers, where the wide
discretion at present enjoyed by the trade and industry secretary is hardly
conducive to firm and consistent policy. An independent OFT, immune from the
intense political lobbying which often accompanies large mergers, would be
far better placed to decide objectively whether they should be referred.
Clarity and efficiency would be further served by publishing the principles
and precedents employed by the MMC and by requiring its members to serve on
a full-time basis.
There may also be a case for entrusting the OFT with some surveillance over
the regulators of privatised industries. Though the record of the regulators
to date is encouraging, their performance should be subject to independent
scrutiny. That is particularly true in industries such as
telecommunications, where the government retains influence.
In some respects, the power of national competition authorities is being
eroded by Brussels. That makes it all the more important, however, that they
pursue policies consistent with the EC approach and enforce them just as
vigorously. If the stiffer competition expected after 1992 is to produce its
full benefits, it needs to be promoted within countries as well as between
them. This is a point that the Labour party, as well as Mr Lilley, should
keep in mind.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Leading Article: US versus the World Bank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THE US administration wants a greater emphasis by the World Bank on the
private sector, it has an odd way of showing it. The main manifestation so
far has been its blocking last week of agreement to an increase in capital
for the part of the World Bank group created specifically to help the
private sector: the International Finance Corporation.
The IFC, which enjoyed growth of 20 per cent a year in the late 1980s,
claims its expansion has been constrained this year by a lack of capital.
The longer the delay, the more it will be hampered from doing its job in
future.
The price the US wants for its assent to a capital increase is a more
explicit focus by the World Bank group on the private sector. Once this
price has been paid, the US has said that an increase of Dollars 750m should
be considered, instead of the doubling of its Dollars 1.3bn in capital that
the IFC is seeking.
The most significant suggestion from the US - that the World Bank might lend
directly to the private sector - would require a change in the Bank's
articles of association and implies a profound shift in Bank strategy. Yet,
however frustrating they may find US tactics, many are prepared to concede
that, up to a point, the US has a point, The Bank could work more closely
with the IFC and should do more to help the private sector.
The question is how. A distinction must be made between helping the private
sector and lending directly to it. The former does not entail the latter and
the latter does not imply the former. It is equally important to remember
what direct lending to the private sector would signify. World Bank lending
to the private sector with government guarantees would reinforce government
meddling in the private sector. But lending to the private sector without a
guarantee could threaten its credit rating.
More risk
Some might argue that the World Bank should bear more risk, but the
implications could be grave. Consider the IFC itself. It has been bolstered
by its successful equity investments in Third World stock markets and
companies, but the performance of its loan portfolio has been weak.
The fundamental question is how far direct lending to the private sector
would further the World Bank's development aims. One powerful case can be
made for such lending. The current policy means that the World Bank can give
help to state-owned companies, but not to private companies that do the same
job. That constraint on the Bank acts as a disincentive to privatisation and
an obstacle to involvement with privatised companies.
Important worries
Yet there are also important worries. In many developing countries it is
small and medium-sized businesses that most need additional capital. Since
the Bank is unable to assess the viability of such borrowers directly, it
has to rely on intermediaries to do the job. In the past, these
intermediaries have often proved ineffective and sometimes corrupt.
The value of lending by the World Bank to big private sector companies is
more debatable still. If such a company is not creditworthy, the Bank should
not lend to it; if it is creditworthy, loans from the Bank may merely keep
it out of private capital markets.
It is also important to remember that the World Bank has a unique role in
funding what will remain public functions in most developing countries:
education, for example, or large scale irrigation, or roads. Any change in
World Bank policy must not threaten its ability to raise money and lend for
such purposes.
In short, the Bank should listen to the US; it should improve its
understanding of the private sector; and it should consider direct lending
to it - but only on a limited basis and, if possible, through expansion of
the activities of the IFC.
For its part, the US should remember both that helping the private sector
does not entail lending directly to it and that development was not brought
about by the private sector alone even within the US. Not least, it should
heed its own advice about the importance of the private sector and back a
substantial capital increase for the IFC.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Arts: Peer Gynt - Berlin Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While A Doll's House and John Gabriel Borkman play among the magic dozen at
the Berlin Theatre Festival (to May 20), the Deutsches Theater's sparkling
new Peer Gynt gives Berlin audiences the rare fortune of seeing significant
productions of early, middle and late Ibsen all within a fortnight.
In this context, what a revelation the poet of Peer Gynt is - lyrical,
witty, infinitely various. Morality, introspection, the rumbling, grumbling
later playwright, these just peep through in Fredo Solter's interpretation,
which offers a surprise Ibsen; tongue in cheek, spring in step, spirit
soaring.
Solter's is the lightest, brightest Ibsen staging I have seen. Clouds and
stars, fjords and floods, cut across a giant gauze sheet which revolves with
the seasons - autumnal brown, midsummer blue. Against this ever-unrolling
backcloth, mood and timbre change as delicately as in Grieg's Peer Gynt
suite; cool pastels for Solveig, burning red for the troll orgies, hard
yellow sun and green moon for the exotic wanderings.
A cornucopia of images, animals, masks, music, taped voices, suggest the
whirlpool of Peer Gynt's mind. Claudia Geisler's Solveig, straw-hatted and
flaxen-haired, stands like a Nordic Tess of the d'Urbervilles against the
midnight sun. Transvestite trolls, plastic buttocks, tails and fangs
attached, tumble out as from a nightclub down the road, and there's a joke
about their Berlin accents. Peer mounts a troll girl as she mounts an
electric-eyed rhino, tongue spurting flames, and all three whoosh off down a
fjord. Man as beast, cooped up with his own conflicting sexual fantasies;
Ibsen was writing half a century before Freud and the raw fear of Peer's
responses still shocks as something new.
Solter pulls together Peer's youthful imaginings and his later life as
wealthy capitalist as two sides of the same coin. Peer Gynt was written in
the same year (1867) as Das Kapital and Solter plays the speculator's
ventures as no less fantastical than the young man's dreams.
It's a wild, lavish reading of the play - a cast of 25 treble up over 70
parts - yet one with diminishing returns, as each gimmick must work harder
while charming less hypnotically. Solter's vision would fit well into three
hours, yet the play runs for five. The Deutsches Theater, Max Reinhardt's
home in the 1920s and the National Theatre of the former DDR, has a
repertoire of 20 such classical productions and is not a theatre to offer
compromises.
As Peer, Daniel Morgenroth's triumph is to hold the stage despite the
distractions of the zoo. With absolute conviction he grows from gangly youth
to autocrat. His voice - energetic staccato bursts modulating up to panic,
down to reflection - speaks his continuing restlessness. Facial muscles are
never still, knees knock together, hands wrestle with each other nervously.
At once funny and vulnerable, he sweet-talks us into accepting the excess of
his desires while acknowledging their theatricality. Yet each time
Morgenroth pushes beyond the game, and when he comes to peel back the onion
layers of his life at last and finds no kernel to himself, we agonise with
him in his and our own exhaustion.

<TEXT>
Lenny Kravitz, a one man encyclopaedia of pop, wowed them at the Academy on
Saturday. This whisp of American black charisma does something so obvious
that you wonder where he has been all these years. He recreates the guitar
rock of the seventies, but with an up-front commitment drawn from the caring
nineties.
So he is Hendrix and the Jacksons one minute; and a preacher man ('Thank God
for the music, not me') the next. The impact is greatest when he sings as if
his life depends upon it, and rips off all those guitar riffs long left
undisturbed in the vault. When he talks, in a surprisingly cultivated
'please love me' accent, the honey is laid on a bit thick. He even leads on
Bob Marley's mother to show off his 'keep the faith' credentials.
It makes for a totally absorbing show. I enjoyed the raunchier songs, like
'More than anything in this world', where he deals with safe pop platitudes
about 'lurve', better than the communal chant of 'Let love rule', but
personality cannot come in small doses. Kravitz, backed by a red blooded
West Coast bands, was a revelation; catch him.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Management: Food for thought
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The most seductive claim made by advocates of customer service - that it
promises huge pay-offs in terms of profitability - is also the most elusive
to measure.
As intuitively appealing as the relationship between service levels and
profits may be, the only data a manager has is usually the 'hard' data
concerning costs. Decisions about the level of quality to build into a given
package - including product, service and value - have been largely based on
those figures and, as Harvey Shycon, a consultant with Arthur D Little,
notes, 'hunches'*.
Shycon defines customer service as part of a total package comprising three
elements: the product itself, the service that comes with it, and,
inextricably linked with these two, value. The pay-off is defined as the
incremental profit received - both from increased market share, sales and
revenues as from reduced costs - as a result of better service.
He claims that Little has developed a way of measuring both the costs and
revenues of different levels of service which allows companies to design a
total quality package to optimise return on investment.
During the course of its work for a large food products company, which had a
US market share of 38 per cent, Little found that the company had a 41 per
cent share of a customer's business. This compared with 32 per cent for its
nearest competitor, and its higher share appeared to be linked to the
greater frequency of deliveries.
More frequent deliveries was good for this customer, a large regional food
chain; it reduced inventory, labour costs and improved the freshness of the
products it sold. For the food products company, it meant a higher cost of
service, but improved margins and volume of sales. This translated into an 8
per cent increase in sales volume and an almost 15 per cent improvement in
profit.
There appears to be proven benefits in the case of this customer, but would
the same level of benefits apply nationally? Little set out to determine the
value to the customer of specific service elements provided by the
manufacturer.
'By comparing those service elements with the service packages provided by
major competitors and determining how the customer spilt its purchases among
several suppliers, we could determine how the customer valued the total
service package in all its aspects and what level of service the customer
was willing to pay,' Shycon said.
The study suggested that the behaviour of the regional food retailer - that
more frequent deliveries would induce it to pay higher prices and increase
purchases from the company - was common to all food retailers. Detailed
statistical work was done to determine more precisely the value to the
customer of each element in the service package.
The bottom line? Two additional market share points nationwide boosted
revenues by Dollars 15.8m a year, of which Dollars 4.75m was additional
profit.

concludes his series on Total Quality Management by stressing the importance
of customer service and assesses Rank Xerox's attempts to achieve it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON

<TEXT>
Few phrases have seized the corporate imagination more in recent years than
'customer service'.
Honoured, perhaps, more in the breach than the observance, serving customers
better has been elevated to the top of many lists of top corporate
priorities for the 1990s.
Customer service - which is a way of life in Japan and, to a lesser extent,
the US - is often confused in Britain with servility. It should not be.
Customer service is the hard-headed pursuit of market share by winning the
loyalty of customers.
Serving customers better, Total Quality Management theorists and
practitioners maintain, is the proven path to increased profitability. They
cite studies which show that well served customers are more likely to make
repeat purchases of goods and services than those who are not.
Throughout the 1980s, customer service as a concept has broadened; TQM
proponents applied it to the internal operations of an organisation as well.
Like many management ideas, this is a self-evident proposition but a
powerful one, nevertheless. Loyal, or repeat, customers can have a
significant effect on a company's profitability. Studies show that they not
only tend to spend more over time, but that they are also more
cost-effective. This is because the costs of customer acquisition -
marketing and advertising - can be spread over time.
There are other benefits. A satisfied customer may tell up to eight others
of the good service he has received; a dissatisfied customer may tell up to
15 others. As a study published last year by Bain &amp; Co, a management
consultancy, noted, 'just avoiding this negative publicity has value' -
although quantifying it precisely is not possible.
For the past six years Xerox, the office equipment manufacturer, has been
trying to live up to its goal of making customer satisfaction its top
business priority. It has found that the pursuit of this goal has led it to
reconsider its organisational structure and the way it remunerates its
employees. The former is designed to place the whole capabilities of the
company - especially the service side of its business - closer to the
customer, while the latter aims to reinforce its rhetoric with real
financial advantages to employees.
In Britain, Rank Xerox's way of getting closer to the customer has been to
divide the country into five regions and bring together sales, service and
administration.
In the words of one recent management presentation to staff: '(The regions)
must exercise local, pro-active, situational decision-making in order to be
truly responsive to our customers.' It added that, in a business where the
office equipment market is fast becoming a commodity market, 'customer
service, support and application capabilities are now the key factors that
influence customer buying decisions'.
Those buying decisions, says Rob Walker, director of quality and management
systems for Rank Xerox UK, can be worth a lot of money. Last year, customers
discontinued using 5,500 Xerox machines out of about 140,000 installed. If
Rank Xerox had retained them all, the impact on its bottom line profit would
have been an extra Dollars 8.5m in 1990, and, over three years, an extra
Dollars 30m.
'If you then add in the opportunity cost the effect on the bottom line is
large,' says Walker. 'Not all of this is, however, controllable and
recoverable. But we reckon that 30 per cent of it is. So the financial
impact of dissatisfied customers is large.'
Rank Xerox spends a lot of time trying to understand its customers,
especially the dissatisfied ones. At present the company estimates that 7
per cent of its customer base is dissatisfied, and it is aiming to reduce
that level of dissatisfaction to zero by 1993.
It attempts to measure the level of customer satisfaction/dissatisfaction
through the responses it receives to two surveys conducted for it by an
independent market researcher. The first is an annual survey, sent out to
more than 130,000 customers. Last year, this survey had a 39 per cent return
rate. 'We take the dissatisfied responses and try to determine the root
causes for the dissatisfaction,' says Walker.
The second is a questionnaire sent out 90 days after a Xerox machine has
been purchased. (Before that the purchaser should have been called by a
customer care officer, and the salesperson responsible for the account
should also have made a call to see that everything is functioning
correctly.) A 'vulnerable' report is completed which highlights dissatisfied
customers. These are acted upon by people in the regions, who meet, decide
an action plan, and agree with the customer what needs to be done to remedy
the problem.
The nature of the complaints is also analysed to see if there are any
generic problems with equipment or service delivery. Walker says the company
has set up three cross-functional teams - comprising people from sales,
service and administration, management and non-management from all levels
throughout the organisation - to look at reliability, the order-to-install
life-cycle, and response time. Their job is to improve the process.
Surveys, teams and analysis may be a rational way of understanding customer
satisfaction/dissatisfaction and alerting management to problem areas, but
senior management at Xerox soon discovered, in the words of Vernon Zelmer,
managing director of Rank Xerox, that 'it is hard to distinguish customer
satisfaction from employee satisfaction. You can't have one without the
other.'
'Without happy and satisfied employees, who believe in what they do and who
can see the managers 'walk as they talk', then the message will fall on
stony ground.'
For the past two years, therefore, Rank Xerox has been working on employee
satisfaction. This has involved work on role clarification (understanding
what the job is); employee involvement (being involved in the job
specification); training; reward and recognition; and measurement.
One of the more intriguing aspects of this has been the decision to tie a
percentage of all Rank Xerox's 4,000 UK employees' pay to the achievement of
customer satisfaction targets. The percentage of pay affected by this
increases as employees become more senior in the company. Directors have 30
per cent of the value of their package riding on attainment of pre-set
goals.
'We look for incremental improvements in customer satisfaction each year,'
says Walker. 'Last year we set ourselves a target of growth of 4 percentage
points for 1991. Xerox Europe has just told us they want it up by 6 points.'
He claims that the company works hard at not allowing managers to make
trade-offs between attaining customer satisfaction targets and ones relating
to purely functional and financial goals. 'If we deliver customer
satisfaction all the other things will follow,' he says. 'This is probably
the most difficult time since 1980/81 but we are still making investment in
customer satisfaction.'
Zelmer is convinced that tying part of his employees' pay to the attainment
of service goals is the right way to go and is working. He says there has
been a positive correlation with the introduction of the new pay scheme and
the company's market share in the UK.
Although he believes that customer satisfaction ought to have been Xerox's
prime aim from the moment it embarked on its quality drive - some 10 years
ago - he is certain that to have tied remuneration to customer satisfaction
goals would have been wrong. 'You can't do that until people have some
control over what they do,' he says.
Management evaluation has also changed. Zelmer subscribes to the view that
'experience shows that 90 per cent of the time it is management that's the
problem, not the people.'
Xerox, among other companies, has introduced a form of assessment where the
managed evaluate the managers. Known as the 'management practice survey',
employees are asked to rate their manager. The results are anonymous and the
manager sits down with his staff and goes through them.
Yet this survey, and others, have shown up the gulf that still exists
between the aspirations of people who work at Rank Xerox and the reality of
working there. As Walker notes, the four things that employees most value -
fairness and respect, reward and recognition, career opportunities, and pay
 -are the things managers are least successful at delivering.
'We are trying to understand what the employees are saying to us and the
role of management in motivating them,' he says. 'We want the role of
manager to change from director to teacher and counsellor. But we still have
a long way to go; you don't change behaviour overnight. Employees have to
see senior managers behave in the appropriate way. It's difficult; it's the
next big leap for us.'
Though Walker maintains that people are always capable of stepping outside
the boundaries of their jobs/responsibil-ities they will do so only if they
are given support. 'They won't if you step on them the first time they do
it.'
And that is a real challenge for management. While senior managers accept,
intellectually, the new style and behaviour the company wants them to
exhibit, '60 per cent of them got to where they are under the old style,' he
says.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The south west regional office of BOVIS CONSTRUCTION in Bristol has been
awarded a Pounds 14.5m management contract by The Western Morning News Co,
part of the Northcliffe newspaper group, to build its new 12,675 sq metre
headquarters at Derriford, in Plymouth, 4.5 miles north of the city centre.
Bovis Construction, a P&amp;O company, will start work in June on the 64-week
project which will provide a combined printing plant, editorial and
administrative offices.
Designed by Nicholas Grimshaw &amp; Partners, the building, which has views of
Dartmoor and Plymouth Sound, resembles a grounded glass ship. Clad
completely in curved faceted glass walls, the entire printing operation will
be visible from the exterior.
The 'open' production areas are situated on two levels and will house the
operations of both the evening and regional morning newspapers, providing
views through the illuminated press hall.
As the building is cut into a hillside, pedestrian access will be directly
into level two. More than 4,500 sq metres of space will be provided in both
open plan and private offices built around a central atrium which will also
accommodate a reception area. The company boardroom will be situated in a
tower, which resembles a ship's bridge, standing 22 metres above the main
building.
The main structure of the building is of in situ reinforced concrete with
flat slabs to office areas, ribbed slabs to production areas and circular
columns extending through all floors to support the steel standard section
cambered roof beams.
The north and south external elevations will feature faceted glass walls.
Cambered roof beams will be supported by fabricated 'tusk' columns. The
glass panel system used will comprise fixed cast steel glazing arms and
struts which will be secured to the concrete columns.

FT  13 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Rowntree Mackintosh offers 37-hour
week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROWNTREE MACKINTOSH has offered food process workers a 37-hour week
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
one of the most significant concessions on shorter hours outside the
engineering and water industries.
The offer provides a fillip for the campaign by UK unions to reduce working
hours. The success of engineering unions in winning 37-hour deals in plants
throughout the country has so far failed to spread significantly to other
industries.
Rowntree's offer, presaged at the start of the year when the company invited
union leaders for talks on hours, was made last week during pay
negotiations.
The company proposed a 9 per cent pay deal and said it was prepared to
reduce the 39-hour week by an hour in November and another hour in May 1993,
subject to discussions at the company's plants.
Deals would have to be made at factories on how the hours reductions should
be arranged and on ways to limit the costs of the reductions, the company
said.
Union leaders said they would be balloting immediately on the 9 per cent
offer, which they expected would be accepted.
They believe there could be opposition to the hours proposal, however,
because of the conditions attached. These include a shortening of tea
breaks, one of the issues which caused controversy in negotiations in the
engineering industry.
Engineering unions claim that more than 500,000 of their members are covered
by agreements for reductions in the previous norm of 39-hour weeks. Some
water companies have also conceded hours.
Elsewhere unions are attaching shorter hours claims to almost every pay
submission, but with limited success. British Rail and British Gas have both
offered reduced hours, but on terms that have so far proved unacceptable to
the unions.
Rowntree's proposed deal appears more likely to be acceptable, even if hard
bargaining may be needed before implementation.
The company, part of Nestle, the Swiss foods group, employes 5,000 process
workers, although the offer does not cover those who work in Glasgow.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Fallout from 'WA Inc' damages Labor: An inquiry in Perth has
heard allegations of a web of deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A JOKE is going round Australia's eastern states about a frog who asks a
Western Australian girl for a kiss, claiming it will restore him to human
shape and bring back his fortune. The girl is about to oblige, but her
sister grabs the frog, puts it in a jar, and closes the lid. 'Why did you do
that?' asks the girl. 'Don't be silly,' says the sister, 'everyone knows a
talking frog is worth more than a Perth entrepreneur'.
The story illustrates the disdain with which Western Australia (WA) is
viewed among the eastern establishment following the collapse of
high-profile entrepreneurs like Mr Alan Bond and Mr Laurie Connell.
But if early indications from an inquiry now sitting in Perth are
substantiated, it may turn out that self-respect is the least of WA's losses
from a period when critics claim the state abandoned many of the standards
which are essential for efficient government.
The fallout will almost certainly lead to the ejection of the state Labor
government after a decade in power, and will damage the re-election
prospects of Mr Bob Hawke's federal Labor government, which will suffer by
association.
For much of the 1980s, Perth was the get-rich-quick capital of Australia, an
easy-money town where entrepreneurs like Mr Bond and Mr Robert Holmes a
Court built business empires which shook boardrooms on three continents.
But as the entrepreneurs succumbed to their mountainous debts, details
emerged of what is alleged to be a web of deals between government and local
businessmen, known collectively as 'WA Inc', which the Liberal opposition
claims has cost taxpayers more than ADollars 1bn (Pounds 833m).
'WA Inc' is being investigated by a Royal Commission, due to report in
January, which has already heard evidence of alleged undeclared donations to
Labor funds, illicit bank accounts used to finance propaganda, and envelopes
stuffed with money kept in ministers' offices. One witness said dealing with
Labor was like dealing with the Mafia.
Later, the inquiry will investigate deals involving government share
dealings, financial guarantees, and investments in companies and projects
associated with well-known entrepreneurs.
There are also allegations of illegal wire-tapping, improper land and
property dealings, and less than enthusiastic investigation of complaints by
the state police. Two deals carried out by Liberal governments in the early
1980s will also be investigated.
The key figure in the inquiry is Mr Brian Burke, WA's Labor premier from
1983 to 1988, when he became Australian ambassador to Ireland and the
Vatican - a post from which he resigned last month after beginning his
evidence to the commission.
Mr Burke denies any impropriety, and maintains that the commission will
clear his name. However, it is clear that his government had a close
relationship with local businessmen.
Under Mr Burke's leadership, the state took an active role in promoting
projects through direct investment or share dealing by government-owned
institutions. Among the most costly were a ADollars 150m investment in
Rothwells, Mr Connell's failed merchant bank, and losses of more than
ADollars 300m on a series of deals relating to a proposed petrochemical
complex which was never built.
Mr Burke, a charismatic former television journalist, was easily able to
overcome opposition within his own party - as the first Labor premier for a
decade he was seen as a messiah who had led the party out of the wilderness.
But evidence is growing that the implementation of government policies owed
as much to the Australian phenomenon of 'mateship', or cronyism, as to
political dynamism.
Witnesses who have yet to give evidence before the inquiry allege several
public service heads of department were removed or shifted to non-jobs to
make way for 'mates' of Mr Burke who were politically sympathetic.
'It was not enough to be neutral; it was not enough to be an able public
servant. They wanted people who were on their side,' one displaced official
claimed.
Mr Barry MacKinnon, the state Liberal leader, says many of the appointees
were 'compliant but not qualified', and blames much of the subsequent
disaster on their inability to manage or give dispassionate advice.
Others, like Mr Lyndon Rowe, director of the WA Confederation of Industry,
say the 'mateship' syndrome is an inevitable consequence of life in a small
town of around 1m people, even if it is the capital of a state the size of
western Europe.
But it is a phenomenon from which Labor appears unwilling to distance
itself. Dr Ian Alexander, a state MP who left Labor partly because of 'WA
Inc', says his efforts to persuade the party to condemn the Burke
government's activities were repeatedly rebuffed.
'It is not the done thing to dump on your mates. That is part of the
Australian tradition, and that is fine, but when people have been found to
have acted in this way, somebody at the top needs to make clear that they
cannot do so with impunity,' he says.
Dr Carmen Lawrence, the premier, refuses to condemn the Burke government, in
spite of the judgment of most political analysts that only that step can
save her government from a huge defeat at the polls. Dr Lawrence concedes
that the steady drip of disclosures from the commission is damaging Labor,
but says it is 'important to be loyal to the tenets of the party'.
Her strategy seems to be to hang on to office in the hope that the
commission will also damage the Liberal opposition, or that the voters' mood
will have changed by polling day in two years' time. The danger is that
whichever party wins the next election, the legitimacy of government in WA
may have been damaged so deeply that it will take years to recover.
As Mr Rowe puts it: 'The real cost of this whole exercise is not the money
that has been lost, it is the added cynicism in the electorate about the
political process, which in Australia does not have a high reputation at the
best of times'.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Brazilian privatisation chief retracts resignation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE head of Brazil's privatisation programme has been persuaded by President
Fernando Collor de Mello to withdraw his resignation to prevent further
delays to already much-postponed state sell-offs.
Mr Eduardo Modiano, president of the National Development Bank and the
Privatisation Commission, had presented his resignation on Thursday along
with some 50 government officials, following the departure of the economy
minister, Ms Zelia Cardoso de Mello.
However, after meeting Mr Collor on Saturday, Mr Modiano agreed to stay,
explaining later: 'The privatisation programme would suffer a loss of
continuity with a change of command at this moment.' He added that Ms
Cardoso had encouraged all those of her team 'whose programmes had not yet
borne fruit' to stay. Mr Modiano and Mr Joao Santana, the new infrastructure
minister, are the only members of the original economic team to stay on.
The privatisation programme, initially scheduled to start last June, is now
expected to be given a boost. Mr Marcilio Moreira, the new economy minister,
has cited it as one of his priorities and according to Mr Modiano the
prospectus for the first sale, that of the steel company Usiminas, will be
agreed on this week.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEPALESE voters went to the polls yesterday in this nation's first
multi-party elections in 32 years, the outcome of which will determine the
future of democracy in the tiny Himalayan Hindu kingdom.
The Nepali Congress party, a centrist group backed by India, was the
favourite going into the polls. But many observers believe no single party
will muster an absolute majority. This would force the Congress party
leaders to join the smaller parties, the Communists or the National
Democratic parties, representing royalist interests, in a coalition
government.
There was a 60 per cent turnout at the polls, according to the Nepal
Election Commission. Voters chose 205 MPs from among 1,345 candidates,
representing 20 political parties, including 219 independent candidates.
Twenty-five people were injured in election-related violence, the commission
said. Police and soldiers were deployed throughout the country and the army
reportedly fired shots over the crowd at two centres. Two ballot boxes were
stolen in the Pyuthan district in mid-western Nepal, the sole constituency
where the election is to be re-held.
The Congress party and the Communist (United Marxist-Leninist) party were
both seeking seats in the election. The two had joined forces just over a
year ago in a popular revolt against Nepal's monarch, King Birendra Bir
Bikram Shah Dev. That uprising resulted in a new constitution and the
promise of a multi-party political system. Since then the Congress party and
the Communists have ruled Nepal jointly through an interim cabinet led by
prime minister Krishna Prasad Bhattarai of the Congress party.
Preliminary results were to be announced by this morning.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Italy's discount rate cut after budget agreed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY yesterday cut its discount rate by one point to 11.5 per cent. This
followed agreement by the cabinet on Saturday to a budget package worth
L14,200bn (Pounds 6.5bn) to bring the deficit back into line with this
year's L132,000bn target.
The moves marked the end of a tense week for Mr Giulio Andreotti's new
government, in which it appeared to be in danger of a renewed crisis and
possibly early elections.
Saturday's mini-budget, which represents a compromise between calls for
tough spending curbs and demands to protect public expenditure, has put off
that risk, at least for the time being.
The new measures will partly satisfy the treasury minister, Mr Guido Carli,
who reportedly threatened to resign if his spending cuts were not accepted.
Mr Carli has also won agreement on preparing for the part-privatisation of
various state enterprises.
The cabinet agreed small rises in employee pension contributions, and
tensions between the coalition parties could return in days given the
decision to prepare a draft pensions reform law by June 15.
Both trade unions and the Democratic Party of the Left (the former
Communists) criticised the increases in pension contribution.
The Socialists, who had argued that changes to the pension system were not
part of the policy package agreed by the coalition parties last month, will
have been pleased with the discount rate cut.
Some L7,100bn is to be saved this year by reducing turnover among
public-sector employees and spending freezes. Meanwhile, a similar amount
will be raised by additional indirect taxes and levies, including charges on
portable telephones and credit cards.
Italy's leading businessmen have criticised the budgetary measures as being
insufficient and weighted too heavily towards revenue raising rather than
spending cuts. However, the discount rate cut, which will help reduce
inflation and lower the government's borrowing costs, has met with approval.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Ministers unworried by idea of two-speed Emu: EC
representatives start to look at the realities of economic and monetary
union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'The prospect of a two-speed monetary union was raised - and no one was
shocked,' said Luxembourg's finance minister, Mr Jean-Claude Juncker, after
he finished chairing an informal meeting on Saturday of EC finance
ministers.
This indeed was the weekend - at the probable half-way point in the EC's
negotiations on economic and monetary union (Emu) - that realities of
various kinds set in:
The reality that there has been far more talk than action in getting the
Twelve's economies to converge on sound budgetary principles.
The reality that, even with crash adjustment programmes in weaker EC
economies, the Twelve will not be able by the late 1990s to move in perfect
unison to a single currency.
The reality that there is little practical difference in granting a grace
period to a country (Britain) which is for the moment politically unwilling
to join Emu and granting one to countries which are economically unable to
do so for a while.
The reality that Germany has monetary might, and perhaps right, on its side
in arguing against setting up a fully-fledged European Central Bank until it
has a real job (running a single currency) to do.
Mr Jacques Delors said Saturday's meeting was 'the best discussion we have
ever had on convergence'. He was referring to the general endorsement that
ministers gave to the idea that the Community should soon start designing
specific 'adjustment' plans for countries with chronic spending deficits
and/or double digit inflation. The EC's monetary committee has suggested
three candidates - Italy, Greece and Portugal - for adjustment programmes.
Mr Delors played down this innovation, noting that Greece had already
submitted itself to EC scrutiny in return for an EC balance of payments
loan, while Portugal and Ireland had called on Brussels for technical help
in setting budget policy.
But introducing specific EC surveillance, well before the planned 1994 start
of the formal Emu transition phase, and extending it to all Twelve (as
France and Spain suggested), is sure to stir controversy. Mr Norman Lamont,
the UK chancellor of the exchequer, said that, even after 1994, the
necessary deficit-pruning and anti-inflation measures should be left to
individual governments.
As a form of monetary convergence, Mr Anders Rasmussen, the Danish finance
minister, suggested that from 1994 on, the fluctuations in the narrow EMS
band should be reduced from 2.25 to 1.5 per cent, and that in 1996 the wider
6 per cent band (within which sterling and the peseta currently gyrate)
should disappear altogether.
But for all such adjustment programmes, ministers generally recognised that
a two- or multi-speed move to Emu was inevitable, a forecast that many of
them and Mr Delors himself had earlier decried when it came from the lips of
Mr Karl Otto Pohl, the Bundesbank president.
It was important to 'de-mystify' a two-speed Emu, Mr Delors said. The
likelihood, he said, was that a majority of countries would assume the Ecu
as their single currency in the late 1990s, and that those countries staying
outside the Emu for a time would have their currencies linked to the Ecu, by
something similar to today's European Monetary System.
After Saturday's meeting, the Commission president refused to elaborate on
his idea, hinting indeed that he might have been precipitate in raising it
so long before the expected wrap-up of Emu negotiations in the autumn.
Signalling clearly the likelihood that the UK would sign the Emu treaty
could still cause the Major government problems with diehard anti-EC Tories
in the run-up to the UK general election that could also come this autumn.
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French finance minister, echoed Mr Delors, saying:
'The treaty must be written so that it does not pre-empt a UK decision,
while at the same time allowing the Emu process to go ahead.' Mr Philippe
Maystadt, finance minister of Belgium, which like France wants fast movement
to Emu, described as the Delors idea as interesting.
But Mr Carlos Solchaga, the Spanish finance minister, said he thought 'it
could create more problems that it would solve'. He appeared to worry that
if the UK got its let-out clause, it would leave Spain more isolated in the
negotiations. For economic reasons, Spain wants a relatively lengthy
transition to Emu, but for political reasons does not want to be lumped with
the likes of Greece in getting a special grace period.
On the vexed issue of when the European Central Bank (ECB) should be set up,
Mr Beregovoy sought to smooth over differences with Germany, with his
officials talking only of an institution 'pre-figuring' the ECB being set up
in 1994. Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, remained as firm as
ever in insisting that the ECB should only be established on the eve of a
single currency, and that calling any lesser institution the ECB would be
dangerously misleading. 'Wrong labels can lead to wrong behaviour,' Mr
Waigel said.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Kohl sees party fall behind in opinion poll

GERMAN Chancellor Helmut Kohl received a further blow to his political
prestige at the weekend when the unfavourable result of an opinion poll
prompted opposition calls for an early election.
The poll by the Emnid institute, published in Der Spiegel, the weekly news
magazine, indicated that if a general election had been held on Sunday, the
ruling Christian Democrats (CDU) would have received only 38 per cent of the
votes, 6 points less than in December's first all-German vote.
The opposition Social Democrats (SPD) improved sharply from 34 per cent to
40 per cent. Mr Hans-Jochen Vogel, the SPD's chairman, said Mr Kohl should
call a new election to end internal government squabbling and deal with the
problems in east Germany.
Germany's current account fell further into deficit in March, mainly through
payments to finance the Gulf war. The DM5.3bn (Pounds 1.8bn) deficit was the
largest ever for one month. It compared with one of DM1.5bn in February this
year and a surplus of DM10.4bn in March, 1990.
The surplus totalled DM2.8bn, against DM2.6bn in February and DM13.8bn in
March last year. Exports were down by 13 per cent and imports 5.4 per cent
higher.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Hopes of EC unity on minimum for VAT

<TEXT>
THE Luxembourg presidency of the EC is to try next month for an agreement by
11 Community states on a minimum standard rate of value added tax, leaving
the UK alone in its opposition to any EC regulation of fiscal rates.
A discussion in Luxembourg on Saturday by EC finance ministers on how to
bring indirect tax rates closer together, in advance of the planned removal
of tax checks at internal EC borders in 1993, revealed a three-way split.
Luxembourg had only Spain's backing for its proposal of a 14 per cent
minimum standard VAT rate, while nine governments indicated their desire for
a 16 per cent minimum.
Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor of the exchequer, said Britain believed
indirect tax rates should be market-driven, and it would oppose any EC tax
proposals, all of which require unanimity to pass.
Mr Jean-Claude Juncker of Luxembourg said his country, with its
traditionally low indirect tax rates, had some sympathy with the UK
argument, but wanted to use the last month of its presidency to get some
agreement on the issue.
Approximation is already, in fact, happening with low-rate countries such as
Luxembourg and Germany raising their VAT rates, and higher-rate countries
like France, Belgium and Ireland lowering theirs. But this process is not
going fast enough for others to contemplate abolishing all cross-border tax
checks in less than two years without fear of trade distortions.
Other proposals to be tackled by finance ministers on June 3 include reduced
VAT rates for necessities, and minimum excise rates on petrol, tobacco and
alcohol.

FT  13 MAY 91 / East German wage rises criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DISRUPTIVE migration of east Germans into west Germany is likely to be
spurred rather than lessened by high wage rises east of the Elbe, according
to a study conducted by US economists.
The report, from the University of California at Berkeley, is critical of
the sharp rise in wages in east Germany since unification got under way last
year. By accentuating the cost squeeze on already uncompetitive east German
companies, the rise of 42 per cent in nominal wages in the first 10 months
of last year has contributed to mass unemployment and short-time working.
After extensive analysis and field work in east Germany, the study calls the
economic collapse there 'one of the worst and sharpest depressions in
European history'.
Opinion surveys carried out for the team in east Germany challenge the
conventional German wisdom on the reasons for east-west migration. Both the
government and trade unions maintain that wage differentials between east
and west need to be reduced to ease the danger of a further influx westwards
of east Germans.
Nominal east German wages are only about 50 per cent of west German levels.
A number of recent pay deals envisage equalising pay rates by 1994.
'We found that few workers will migrate for higher western wages. Most
prefer to work in the east in spite of the wage differential, and are
prepared to wait there for new jobs to appear if they become unemployed,'
says the report, which will appear in the spring issue of Brookings Papers
on Economic Activity. It concludes: 'Higher wages (in east Germany) will
cause more migration by increasing unemployment than they will deter by
closing the wage gap.'
The report recommends that the Bonn government pay a wage subsidy or
'employment bonuses' to all private sector companies hiring in the east.
Last year's wage rises were in contrast to a 50 per cent reduction in
industrial output and in the prices of manufactured goods in east Germany
after the introduction of the D-Mark on July 1 1990.
The report says the suggested wage subsidy could be as high as 75 per cent
of a worker's wage. The scheme would more or less pay for itself as it would
foster economic activity by increasing profitability and investments.
Expenditure on the subsidy would be offset by additional state income from
tax and social security contributions, reductions in unemployment benefit
payments, and by enhancing the value of privatised companies.
Although criticism of high wage levels has also been made by German
economists and, increasingly, the government, the US economists are the
first to offer a detailed solution to the problem.
They say their proposed wage subsidy would make a crucial difference to the
survival prospects of most east German companies. After currency union last
year, they estimate, only 8 per cent of the east German labour force worked
in companies which earned sufficient revenue to cover short-term costs.
The fundamental problem hindering privatisation of east German companies is
that most of them have negative value, since their costs exceed revenue in
the absence of great productivity improvements.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Survey of Cardiff (10): A three-way strategy - Professional
services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARETH GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY OF Cardiff's striking new office buildings are occupied by the city's
leading accountants, solicitors and architects - visual evidence of
prosperity and growth in the mid and late 1980s, when annual fee income rose
between by 30 and 50 per cent each year.
However, the economic downturn has now reached the city professions, albeit
in a mild form.
Hywel G Jones, South Wales senior partner in Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, the
UK's largest accountancy firm, points out that it would have been
unrealistic to expect the growth rates to continue at such levels:
'We were seeing growth rates in our firm of between 40 per cent and 50 per
cent a year. It was obviously not going to continue at that level. I do not
think the professions will have it as good in the next 10 years as they have
in the past 10.'
But most large professional firms expect growth rates in fee income this
year of between 10 per cent to 15 per cent.
The smaller professional practices, concentrating on private-client and
domestic work, have been hit hardest. The larger firms still have the
benefits of Cardiff's dominance of service provision in South Wales, the
work from inward investment projects, strong working relationships between
the public and private sectors, and efficient networking facilities.
The gap is widening between the large firms and the rest. Coopers &amp; Lybrand
Deloitte, Peat Marwick, Touche Ross, Ernst &amp; Young, and Price Waterhouse all
have substantial offices in Cardiff with national and international work as
well as local. Most is generated, rather than referred from other practices
in their networks.
Professional polarisation has also had an impact on architects. Firms such
as Hoggett Lock-Necrews get about 40 per cent of their work from outside
Wales.
The only profession not to see polarisation is the Bar, which is not
organised on partnership or firm lines. The four sets of chambers operating
from Cardiff are still expanding, but commercial solicitors tend to instruct
barristers from specialised commercial chambers in London.
Mr Robert Ellis, the partner in charge of accountants Touche Ross, points
out that professional services in Cardiff have increased continuously in
expertise, and that clients who 10 years ago would have automatically gone
to London for advice now seek professional services in Cardiff.
Three common factors have emerged in the way the professions are coping with
the present situation, and their plans for the 1990s. These are: to widen
the markets they serve on a geographical basis; to deepen the level of
specialties they offer; and to build up links with practices in other
European Community and overseas countries.
The first means, in effect, that firms are competing not only in the local
market but nationally. All the city's leading firms judge themselves by City
of London standards, and believe that, apart from projects involving large
numbers of people or very specialised functions, they can compete in quality
and price.
Professional fees in Cardiff are considerably lower than in London. The
hourly rates of the leading Cardiff solicitors are between one third and a
half of those of top City solicitors. The accountants have a price
differential of around a third less than London.
Cardiff's lawyers and accountants are seeking to exploit this by combining
it with niche products and geographical access. Phillips &amp; Buck, with 22
partners and 100 lawyers, has joined the Eversheds network to gain access to
a national spread of offices.
Mr David Vokes, managing partner, says this trend of increasing the
geographical access (both nationally and through association with other
European Community practices) fits in with the move to growing
specialisation.
'We are in the business of solving clients' problems. While most of our
business is based in South Wales, we are able to call on resources
elsewhere. This provides flexibility.' he said.
A speciality where Cardiff firms have a competitive edge nationally is
professional advice on inward investment. Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, for
example, has built up a centre of excellence in work of this kind, and most
major projects are now referred to the Cardiff office by the group's other
UK practices.
The second thrust of the strategy is to widen and deepen the levels of
specialisation on offer. Huw Williams is a partner at Edwards Geldard, the
law firm, and is in charge of the its work for the Cardiff Bay Development
Corporation. He is a specialist in planning and environmental law.
'In the past, the legal work on the Bay would have gone straight to London,'
he said. 'I think that what we have proved is a speedy response of
specialised units which are based locally. Specialisation is the key to
success, and that is what we have been concentrating on.'.
The accountants have been at the forefront of the move to greater
specialisation with the Cardiff majors providing a full range of financial,
corporate and management consulting services. Hugh Thomas is the partner in
charge at Price Waterhouse and a strong proponent of accountants becoming
more involved with clients. 'I think we feel we are contributing more and as
Wales becomes more entrepreneurial, there is a need for wider and wider
advice,' he said.
One example of this is the computer consulting business established by Ernst
&amp; Young in Cardiff. Ieuan Griffiths, the senior manager in charge, believes
such services are now a crucial part of the overall package on offer: 'We
can start from scratch and go straight through with the client in
implementing strategy. Projects in some cases last a few months, in others
more than two years.'
The third part of the strategy and the most difficult to assess is the
development of links with professional practices in other Community
countries. The accountants have had a head start with their existing
international links and the law firms have concentrated on developing
relationships on non exclusive terms with continental law practices.
Cardiff's professions have promoted awareness of the European single market
in a vigorous fashion. Today, for example, Edwards Geldard and Ernst &amp; Young
host a seminar on business in Europe - appropriate in a city where two of
the main roads are named after Nantes and Stuttgart, Cardiff's twin cities.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Survey of Cardiff (11): Reaching for the stars - Stewart
Dalby asks whether more hotels are needed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE face of it, Cardiff seems to have plenty of hotels.
If you emerge from Central station and look skywards slightly to the right,
your eyes are met by the masthead of the Holiday Inn (182 rooms). It is
unusual to see a Holiday Inn in a British city centre: they tend to be built
on the periphery of towns, close to motorways.
Two hundred yards from the Holiday Inn, past the ice rink, is the
International Hotel (143 rooms), built by Brent Walker at a cost of Pounds
7.5m, and opened last September.
If, instead of crossing St Mary's Street to the Holiday Inn in Mill lane,
you turn left down St Mary's Street, you quickly come to the Royal Hotel (63
rooms). Continue past St David's Hall, and you come to the Angel Hotel (91
rooms). Situated between Cardiff Castle and the Arms Park rugby ground, the
Angel describes itself as the city's premier hotel.
Close by is the Park Hotel (119 rooms) and the Crest Hotel (157 rooms).
Farther out, near to the motorway, are the Post House (150 rooms) and the
Moat House (144 rooms).
All of these are three- or four-star hotels. Most could be described as new
'business' or old 'town' hotels. They all charge between Pounds 50 and
Pounds 80 a night.
If a couple of places not mentioned are included, the total number of
bedrooms in quality hotels is around 1,000 to 1200. If one were to include
two-star hotels, Cardiff probably has some 6,000 rooms available.
How much accommodation does a city need? Albeit a capital city, though one
which is not yet an established business-and-services centre, nor on the
well-mapped circuit for cultural and heritage tourists? For the moment, the
answer would seem to be: about what it has got.
The occupancy rate of the Holiday Inn, for example, is 70 per cent, spread
through the week. It is full of business people during weekdays, while
weekends are a moveable feast. If there happens to be a rugby international
at Cardiff Arms park, the hotel is full to overflowing; if there is not, it
can be empty.
According to Jack Nicholas, general manager of the Holiday Inn, a good
weekend trade was beginning to build in family tourists taking advantage of
heavily discounted room prices. But this was thwarted by the Gulf war and
the recession. The past few months have seen a decline in weekend bookings.
Most of Cardiff's other quality hotels probably have occupancy rates similar
to that of the Holiday Inn, though the International Hotel has an occupancy
rate of 50 per cent, being a new hotel still building up business.
If supply seems to be roughly in line with current demand, the situation
could soon change, even though a Copthorne hotel is being built, for Cardiff
has aspirations to become both an important business-and-services centre and
a cultural tourist city, in the manner of York, Chester or even Glasgow.
For most people, the transformation to a services or business city is linked
with the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation. When the barrage is built
across the bay, Cardiff could become a maritime city with some 5m sq ft of
extra office space, many tourist and leisure facilities, and 30,000 new jobs
in buildings that will be put up on what is now largely derelict land. The
development corporation believes it will be 10 to 15 years before these
targets are realised.
Before then, other developments could ensure a greater demand for hotel
rooms. Opposite the International Hotel is the half-finished World Trade
Centre, being developed by Brent Walker. Technical problems have delayed its
completion. But with a city grant and a soft loan from the European
Investment Bank, it should now be finished by the middle of next year.
It will have exhibition space and conference facilities for 5,000 people.
Brent Walker also bought the ice rink in 1989. It has managed to change its
use designation (though it is home to a successful ice-hockey team, which
will continue to use it), and it can now be covered over and used, for
example, for rock concerts. It seats 4,000. Despite Brent Walker's well
publicised financial problems of the past year, these projects are
proceeding, and will mean a greater demand for hotel space.
So, too, may the efforts being made by Cardiff Marketing, a private company
supported by local councils and the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation. The
thought underlying Cardiff Marketing's efforts is that, if Glasgow can be
publicised into life, then why not Cardiff? It is, after all, a capital city
with a rich cultural identity.
It is estimated that 2m visitors went to Cardiff last year, but fewer than
100,000 went to tourist centres for information. The potential is therefore
considerable. The city may even get a five-star hotel.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Survey of Cardiff (12): Nothing at the top level, but still
a good choice - Restaurants / Anthony Moreton studies the menu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
WHEN DE Courcey's restaurant burnt to the ground last month, a pall darker
than the smoke from the fire hung over the business community. De Courcey's
had, within a very short time, become one of the favourite places in which
to talk shop.
The restaurant was the brain-child of Thilo and Pat Thielmann. He had been
manager of the Holiday Inn, and the two of them decided to open a top-drawer
restaurant, to which they eventually hoped to add a number of bedrooms, to
create the sort of restaurant with rooms that is so common in France.
The wooden building had an unusual history. It had been brought over from
Scandinavia in 1892, by a Nordic businessman who had settled in Cardiff and
wanted to live somewhere that reminded him of home. It was not only built of
wood, but the rooms were panelled. These the Thielmanns had carefully
restored, by stripping off layers of paint.
Within its short three-year life, the Thielmanns had turned the place, an
out-of-town restaurant deep in Cardiff's green belt, into one of the best
restaurants in Wales. In three hours in the early hours of an April morning,
the fire that consumed it left just the four brick chimney-stacks.
The Thielmanns will no doubt create another restaurant. In the meantime
diners, as well as business lunchers in Cardiff, are not starved for choice.
Good restaurants have grown with the city over the last decade, and if none
has reached the very top level Cardiff is not unique in this respect. It is
a curious fact that the Good Food Guide names 32 top-rated restaurants in
Britain, but only four in cities outside London - in Norwich, Plymouth
Bradford and Bristol.
One of the growing favourites in Cardiff is Trillium, which at first glance
looks like a club library whose back part changes into a conservatory. Welsh
Water's main Cardiff office is around the corner, and many of its
executives, including the chairman, Mr John Elfed Jones, are to be seen
there.
Slightly further out of the city centre is La Chaumiere, where Karen Duncan
and Rory Garvey took over some 18 months ago. The restaurant sits in the
shadow of Llandaff cathedral, but it gets rather more of its clientele from
the nearby BBC headquarters than from ecclesisatical patronage.
An innovative in-town restaurant is the Armless Dragon, where the
proprietor, David Richards, is also one of the two chefs. Although the basis
of the cuisine is European, there are touches of far-distant places and an
emphasis on pure foods. Diners include a good sprinkling of mandarins from
the Welsh Office.
One who has made a notable mark is Meirion Dally who, with his wife Ann, has
created a Welsh ambience at Blas ar Gymru, or A Taste of Wales. Wales has
never had a particularly strong tradition of native dishes, but the Dallys
have attempted to get as close to a Welsh cuisine as possible. They even
offer Welsh wine, produced just outside Cardiff.
The waiters and waitresses at Blas ar Gymru are dressed in traditional Welsh
outfits, including the stove-pipe hats, and the piped music is Welsh. Dishes
include laver bread (a processed seaweed), cockles, Welsh cakes and Lady
Llanover duck, a traditional Welsh way of preparing the bird.
Not far away, and in direct competition, is Yr Ystafell Gymreig - The Welsh
Room. Although the name is Welsh, the emphasis is more mainstream European
with fillet steak Lloyd George offered as a touch of Wales. It also has
laver bread on the menu.
Among ethnic places, the Indian Ocean is a transplant from the people who
gave London the Red Fort; and a recent Chinese addition is the Orient
Rendezvous, from which a dum sum could be dropped-kicked into the Arms Park,
the great rugby ground, across the road. In a previous incarnation, this
restaurant was called Spangherro's - after the famous French rugby forward.
Nearby is the Noble House, where lovers of Chinese are frequently serenaded
by a harpist.
The restaurant most characteristic of its homeland is Le Cassoulet, where
the emphasis is on the dishes of the south of France. Cassoulet Toulousain
is always on the menu, and is a must for those who want to savour the
flavours of Provence.
Two restaurants that have undergone something of a sea change are Gibsons
and Le Gourmet Enchante. Gibsons is the doyen of Cardiff dining places, its
chef-owner, Mrs Irene Caning, being virtually the first to bring innovative
French cuisine to the city. Le Gourmet Enchante was a more recent addition
in the same vein.
Both have, in the past few months, taken on a new identity, with new menus
placing them more firmly in the mainstream of French-style cooking. Gibsons
has changed into Quayles, with Mrs Caning still in charge; while Le Gourmet
Enchante is now merely Le Gourmet, and describes itself as a brasserie. For
music-lovers, the Celebrity restaurant, in the St David's Hall, offers not
just reasonably-priced food but an attractive wine list at tempting prices.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Survey of Cardiff (9): Euro-flights may be spokes from a hub
 -The airport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST BEFORE seven o'clock on the morning of April 8, a Jetstream 31, of Manx
Airways, took off from Cardiff-Wales airport, at Rhoose, 15 miles west of
the capital, with a full payload of 16 passengers.
One hundred minutes later, it touched down in Brussels, and a dream nurtured
for years within the Welsh business community had become reality.
Capt Norman Brewitt, the airline's chief pilot, who was at the controls, had
helped to introduce a service much needed in Cardiff - a direct link between
the Welsh capital and the de facto, if not de jure, capital of the European
Community.
Four hours after the Brussels flight, another Manx aircraft, a JE 103, took
off for Dusseldorf. The two flights represented a double first: the first
time Cardiff had been linked directly to these European cities, and the
first time Manx had run a continental service.
Mr Terry Liddiard, managing director of Manx, says the company wants to
create a hub of services from Cardiff: 'There is enormous potential in South
Wales, and we see it as a major centre for our services. We hope to bring in
a twice-daily Paris flight later this year, and introduce another service to
Manchester in the autumn.'
Manx already operates services from Cardiff to the Isle of Man (its home
base), Glasgow, the Channel Islands, Dublin and Belfast.
Cardiff is not without international flights. Air France introduced a Paris
service last year; and KLM, through one of its subsidiaries, has for some
years operated one to Amsterdam. The latter, like the Brussels flights,
provides a connecting point for passengers who want to fly on to other
destinations without having to use Heathrow or Gatwick.
There have been a number of attempts to bring intercontinental carriers into
the Welsh capital, but this has proved a difficult business to generate.
Airlines providing flights to Toronto, Florida and the Caribbean have come
and gone, to the dismay of the airport's director, Mr Graham Greaves. These
carriers have either been absorbed by bigger partners, or fallen into
financial difficulties.
But Mr Greaves promises: 'We shall have Toronto, and Orlando in Florida, on
the schedules this year - Toronto for the first time direct.' Nationair, the
Canadian airline, will serve Toronto with a Boeing 757, and the UK carrier
Monarch is also using a 757 on its North American operations.
The core of Mr Greaves' strategy, though, is to develop Cardiff as a
business centre for European destinations. 'We must try and generate more
scheduled flights,' he says. 'This is where our destiny lies.'
Businessmen in South Wales have for years bemoaned the lack of direct links
with European centres. Since Cardiff is one of the UK's three main centres
of government, they believe that Brussels, in particular, should be a big
earner, especially as civil servants need to travel there for meetings.
But the South Wales business community is not large, and it will need to use
the airport to the full if Manx's enterprise is to be justified.
The omens are not overwhelmingly favourable, however, despite the cries for
such a link. Air France, for instance, has not had great success with its
Paris service, launched last year, though this may have something to do with
the less-than-convenient time-slot.
Like most regional airports in Britain, Cardiff, until last year one of the
fastest-growing, must therefore continue to rely heavily on its charter
traffic for its immediate profitability.
'About 85 per cent of all our traffic is in the charter business,' says Mr
Greaves. 'That, inevitably, peaks between June and September; and so, to
utilise the airport's facilities more sensibly, we need to flatten that peak
by attracting out-of-season business.'
But Cardiff, again like other regional airports, has been hit by the
recession and the Gulf war. It also faces competition from Bristol which,
with a catchment area of some 4m people, compared with Cardiff's 2.5m, is in
a healthier position to attract holidaymakers bound for Spain, Greece and
the ski slopes.
Mr Greaves takes encouragement from what he detects as a change in holiday
patterns. 'Holidaymakers are looking to go further afield. They are looking
to the Caribbean and Florida, and this is where Cardiff has a distinct edge.
We have the second-best weather conditions of any British airport.' He also
considers that Cardiff's runway, extended four years ago, provides
advantages. 'Our 7,723ft runway can handle all the big giants - including
Concorde.'
Two years ago, a British Airways jumbo flew non-stop from Cardiff to Seattle
on America's west coast, with a full payload. And this winter some 30
aircraft landed at Cardiff on diversions from Heathrow and Gatwick. In the
summer, Concorde will take a party of Americans, holidaying in Europe, back
home from Cardiff.
When British Airways opens its giant maintenance plant alongside the
airport, five jumbos a month will be flown into the airport, to be handled
in the hangar - a welcome boost in landing fees.
Those fees helped to increase profitability to a record Pounds 1.9m in
1989-90, the last year for which figures are available. The figures will
tumble for the year just ended, given the difficult time experienced by
airlines and airports around the world.
But the Pounds 12m capital-spending programme is going ahead. Work begins
this summer on a lounge for international passengers, and better Customs
facilities will be provided. These should be ready by the end of next year.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Survey of Cardiff (8): End of S4C contract trims HTV's
profits - Stewart Dalby tunes in to 'media city'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
CARDIFF HAS such a vibrant and diverse media scene that it has often been
termed 'media city' in its promotions.
Depending on where you are and how you set your aerial, it is possible to
receive seven different television channels or variants of channels.
Similarly, it is possible to tune in not only to Radio Wales but also to the
other five BBC stations, as well as a variety of commercial ones.
The city has its own morning, evening and Sunday newspapers - the morning
paper, the Western Mail, styling itself 'the national newspaper of Wales'.
Cardiff is also thought to have more independent television producers than
any city outside of London. If video companies and design concerns are
included, around 6,000 people are employed in the media industry, some 2,500
of them involved directly in broadcasting.
One reason why there is such life in the media sector is the Welsh language.
After the failure to get an assembly for Wales, in the late 1970s, a
public-service Welsh-speaking television station, S4C, was established in
1982-83. There was perceived to be a genuine need. Between a fifth and a
third of people in Wales speak Welsh.
Yet it was not just a question of language: there was a cultural identity to
be catered for. At the same time, non-Welsh-speaking people were
increasingly fed up with hours (often peak hours) of viewing time devoted to
programmes in a different language. The fourth channel was therefore a neat
political solution to a social and cultural problem.
The fact that Cardiff is a national capital, rather than just the centre of
a region, influences the printed media, too. John Humphries, editor of the
Western Mail, pursues what he calls a twin-track policy:
'We have to compete with all the London-based newspapers - notice I call
them London-based and not national newspapers - on international, political
and sports coverage. At the same time, we have to supply news about Wales,
in which there is great interest.'
News of Wales is editionised. The Western Mail has nine editions, regional
and otherwise. Two pages of news about Wales are changed each night.
The paper feels strongly about local issues. Recently it took David Hunt,
secretary of state for Wales, to task for failing to push through parliament
the private bill that would have allowed a barrage to be built across
Cardiff Bay.
The existence of S4C has meant that the two main television channels, BBC
Wales and HTV, have prospered, because, in a sense, they had a captive
market. S4C has a budget of about Pounds 44m and runs about 25 hours of
Welsh-language programmes which go out on Channel 4. Until recently, those
which were not produced by the BBC were largely made by HTV. The main
commercial channel had a five-year contract to make nine hours a week for
S4C.
Since the contract expired, however, S4C has turned more and more to the
growing band of independent producers.
Loss of revenue through the drop in demand from S4C has contributed to a
huge dent in HTV's pre-tax profits, though other factors have included: a
new exchequer levy imposed in January 1990, changes in the way programmes
are made, a poor advertising market, and competition from independent
producers in areas other than Welsh-language programmes.
Pre-tax profits for the year ended December 1990 were Pounds 5.3m on
turnover of Pounds 179m. A direct comparison is difficult, because of a
change in the year end; but for the five months that ended December 1989
they were Pounds 7.4m, and for the year ended July 1989, Pounds 14.5m.
Hard times have also resulted in severe staff cuts. Some 700 people are now
employed, compared with more than 1,000 two years ago
One way to improve profits might be to make more programmes for the national
network. But the domination of the network system by the big five commercial
companies (Central, Thames, London Weekend, Yorkshire and Granada), says
Mansel Jones, head of press and public relations at HTV, makes it difficult
for medium-sized commercial companies such as HTV to get a look in.
HTV faces further competition in that, by 1992, 25 per cent of output must
be made by independent producers. But before then - this month, in fact - it
faces a stiff challenge when its licence comes up for renewal. The new round
of franchises, which will be partly determined by sealed cash bids, is
considered unfair at HTV.
Mr Jones has compared them to a 'blind crap shoot'. There is a feeling at
HTV that the expertise in making programmes for Wales should count for
something more than cash in an envelope when the bids are sorted.
BBC Wales, too, has been experiencing upheavals. As part of the Funding the
Future exercise, which requires the BBC as a whole to save Pounds 75m by
1993, it is looking for savings of Pounds 2m and the loss or contracting out
of 300 jobs. It, too, has to commission 25 per cent of its output from
independents by 1992.
With this shake-up under way, Geraint Talfan Davies, controller of BBC
Wales, sees the challenge of the future as making more English-speaking
programmes, not just for Wales but also for the national network. Recently,
BBC Wales announced that it would, for the first time, appoint a
non-Welsh-speaker to a top programme post.
BBC Radio Wales already has a substantial number of its programmes
networked: last year, it had 306 hours broadcast on other BBC stations.
Gaynor Shutte, the new editor of BBC Wales, wants to increase this
substantially, not just because it is lucrative, but because it keeps up
standards.
In contrast, BBC Television Wales networked only 20 hours last year, partly
because of its Welsh-language obligations. (BBC Scotland networked 160 hours
of its programmes). But Geraint Talfan Davies hopes the number of networked
hours will reach three figures in the next few years.

<TEXT>
MOTORISTS faced with delays due to road-widening schemes may at some stage
in the future give thanks for the day when Ron Brindle, a civil engineer,
walked into the University of Wales College of Cardiff.
Mr Brindle came in with an idea which, developed in conjunction with the
university college, has led to a soil-nailing machine which can drastically
reduce the amount of time it takes to widen roads.
The machine, which uses high air-pressure to fire nails into the soil at
200mph, has been patented and developed; and licencing arrangements have
been made worldwide.
The University of Wales College of Cardiff (UWCC) became involved through
its commercial consulting arm, and a licence was given to the Welsh-based
Ryan International group. The project is one of 12 licences in which UWCC is
involved with the private sector.
This story of the soil nailing machine illustrates the emphasis at UWCC on
commercial services and technology-transfer schemes. The college, with 1,000
academic staff, 28 schools and departments and more than 9,000 students, is
the largest of the colleges that make up the University of Wales. Its size
and commercial contacts mean that it has a significant role in the life of
the city.
In 1989-1990, it won Pounds 2.1m worth of research contracts from British
industry, and through other consultancy work generated an additional Pounds
1.8m. There have been several instances of high-technology companies being
spun off by the university college, as a result of projects in which it was
involved.
Geraint Jones is the head of UWCC's commercial services section, and at the
forefront of efforts to boost academic and industry links. 'There is often a
difference in time scales, but our people are very appreciative of
industry's ethos. It is important to retain a balance between pure research
and the subsequent use of new knowledge,' he said.
The section acts as a focus for liaison with industry. Companies involved in
projects include such big names as British Steel, Ferranti, Procter and
Gamble, as well as local companies. Links are further fostered through
placements of Cardiff graduates in 15 companies, to help with research under
the Science and Engineering Research Council's Teaching Company scheme.
UWCC prides itself on a number of pace-setter departments which are
generally regarded as centres of academic excellence. These include city and
regional planning, aeronautical and mechanical engineering, maritime
studies, nasal physiology, the semi-conductor and microelectronics centre,
and the automotive industry unit at the Cardiff Business School, which is
part of the university college.
The mood at UWCC is one of cautious optimism, exemplified by a new Pounds
27m engineering faculty building scheduled to come on stream by 1993 and
catering for 1,100 students. UWCC has also emerged as one of the UK's
leading centres of Japanese studies with a number of Japanese joint honours
schools introduced at undergraduate level where Japanese is combined with
such disciplines as law or business studies.
The university college's most direct contact with business in Cardiff is
through the Cardiff Business School, the fourth largest in the UK with 1,000
students and 13 full-time professors. Its courses include both undergraduate
and postgraduate work and the school tailors courses for managers in local
companies. Recent research contracts include a study of the Principality's
labour market, for Welsh Water.
Professor Roger Mansfield, the school's head, sees a role for the school as
a catalyst and enabler, to improve management skills in Wales. 'The rapid
development of short courses is based firstly on serving the growing needs
of the region, and secondly, developing courses in areas of particular
research strength.'
Cardiff is particularly strong in the automative industry, Professors Dan
Jones and Garel Rhys having built an international reputation. Consequently,
most of the big motor manufacturers have used Cardiff for consulting work.
At a non-academic level, training and education for jobs in Cardiff is
focused on the new South Glamorgan Training and Education Council (TEC), set
up in February. It has a staff of 50 and a budget of Pounds 12m. Paul
Sheldon, its chief executive, believes the tough decisions the TEC will be
making on training-provision in Cardiff are bound to be controversial:
'Our primary client is the employer. We have to ensure that we are training
people for real jobs. That means we will have to look carefully at the
quality and scope of the training on offer at present.'
The South Glamorgan TEC faces four priorities in determining the future of
training in the Welsh capital:
The TEC has to carry out a quality audit of training provision, and decide
which courses and schemes to scrap. Mr Sheldon thinks the 60 organisations
currently involved in training is too many.
There needs to be greater targeting in training in Cardiff. Traditionally,
the take up-rates for adult training in Cardiff is around 90 per cent of
places filled, compared with 60 to 70 per cent nationally. However, if
people in Cardiff are being trained for skills where there are no job
prospects, such courses will have to be scrapped, and emphasis placed on
market-led targetting.
There are no models to forecast how the south-east Wales economy will
perform - an obstacle to detailed labour-market planning. Discussions are
being held with various groups in Cardiff to see if such a model can be
developed.
The public sector as an employer plays a crucial role in the Cardiff labour
market, with nearly 50 per cent of jobs in the city coming from the public
sector. Public sector orientated programmes need to be included in training
provision.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Survey of Cardiff (4): Authorities back a five-year
initiative - Marketing the city
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON

<TEXT>
ST DAVID's Day is always special for the Welsh, but this year March 1 was
extra special for Cardiff. In the presence of the Princess of Wales, and
with the young Prince William making his first public appearance, the city
launched a marketing campaign to make itself better known and understood
around the world.
Under the aegis of the city, five public bodies unveiled a Pounds 10m
marketing programme with the title: Just Capital.
The five are: South Glamorgan county council, the Welsh Development Agency,
the Wales Tourist Board, Cardiff Bay Development Corporation and the city
council. They guaranteed to put up Pounds 5m over the next five years, and
set out to find a similar sum from the private sector. Marks and Spencer
immediately contributed Pounds 20,000.
At the same time, it was announced that Wynford Evans, chairman of the
recently-privatised South Wales Electricity, would become chairman of
Cardiff Marketing, a private company established out of the ashes of the
municipally-run Cardiff Marketing Bureau, on June 1; and that Norma Jarboe
would take over immediately as chief executive.
'The problem Cardiff has always had to face,' says Mr David Seligman, a
solicitor and city councillor who headed the move to go private, and who
remains chairman of Cardiff Marketing until Mr Evans takes over, 'is that
people have the wrong impression about the city. Abroad, they simply wonder
where it is in the UK. Here at home, it is generally seen as a dirty place
with few amenities, not worth a visit. Incredibly, people still think it's a
town of coal and steel.
'Once they get here, they find a magnificent modern city, a city that can
fill a theatre with opera and a concert hall on the same night. What they
find is not at all what they imagined. Our task is therefore to get the
world to see that Cardiff is a fine place: that way, we shall attract
tourists, inward investment, more jobs and help enlarge the city's
prosperity.'
That view is echoed by Miss Jarboe, who can take a dispassionate approach.
'Changing the image is what we must be about,' she says. 'People who come
are bowled over, and are only too happy to return.'
Discounting the fact that it is Miss Jarboe's job to 'sell' the city, she
can be more dispassionate than the locally-born solicitor who is her present
chairman, because she is an American and her links with the Welsh capital
were minimal before her appointment.
Norma Jarboe, who is 44, was born in New Mexico, moved east to college in
Denver, and still farther east to work in New York on urban affairs and
public-policy planning for Citibank. Soon after the Brixton riots in London,
in 1981, the bank was asked to second someone to London to work on
inner-city problem areas, and she was 'volunteered'. Although primarily
concerned with Brixton after her arrival in London, her work subsequently
branched into fellowship programmes and youth enterprise schemes; until
1986, when she herself branched out as a consultant in the field of public
affairs, community relations, sponsorship and communications.
The thinking behind Cardiff's marketing programme has been heavily
influenced not only by the need to alter perceptions of the city, but also
by the success that Glasgow achieved with its Glasgow's Miles Better
campaign.
'Glasgow have done what we want to do here,' Mr Seligman says. 'At one time
Glasgow was thought of as a rough, tough city. Today, it is seen as a city
of culture, a place of refinement, a place in which to do business, and a
place where people will happily move to work.'
Mr Seligman wants people around the world to think in the same way about
Cardiff. 'Despite the general perception, we have already had a lot of
success in attracting companies here. We have attracted Tesco with a
headquarters operation, for instance, National Provident Institution and
Rothschild. All of these have come in the past few years, so we knew that
with a bit of a push we could use the campaign to broaden and develop the
economic base of the city.'
Miss Jarboe says that the first step will be to bring the message to the
city itself. Already posters with the Just Capital logo are beginning to
appear on sites around the city. 'We must give them a sense of involvement,
a sense of pride,' she says.
Miss Jarboe speaks quickly. Thoughts and ideas pour out of her. 'Take the
taxi drivers,' she says. 'They are often the first people a visiting
businessman meets. Get them to enthuse about the city, give them civic
pride, and they will help influence the visitor. When we have laid the
groundwork here in Cardiff, we'll take the programme wider: national within
the UK first, then international. This has always been an international
city, and we will capitalise on that.'
All this is planned on Pounds 2m a year in each of the coming five years.
Can it be achieved? More important, can the Pounds 5m that has to come from
the private sector be raised?
Cardiff is not a city of big employers. Few have more than 1,000 people, and
few of these have their headquarters in the city. Most of the potential
donors that Mr Evans will have to approach probably have headquarters in the
south east of England, so their allegiance to the Welsh capital is not as
deep as his own.
His task as chairman of Cardiff Marketing is all about money and raising it;
but in the present economic climate, charitable giving is being reduced.
The Welsh politician, Ray Gunter, said in 1964, when Harold Wilson appointed
him minister of labour, that he had been given the 'bed of nails'. The
parallel with Mr Evans' task is not inapposite.

THIS IS Europe Week in Cardiff. The festival is a promotion of Europe within
the Welsh capital and, in particular, of the city's place within Europe.
It sees French fashion, German food, Italian music, opera from the Welsh
National Opera Company - and, this being Wales, a rugby festival.
Cardiff is Europe's youngest capital, created in 1955. Although twinned with
Stuttgart and Nantes, it has not had particularly strong links with
continental Europe since its coal trade collapsed after the second world
war.
'This festival,' says Roger Paine, the city's chief executive, 'is intended
to raise the importance of Europe within Cardiff. In doing that, we want it
also to raise our profile within Europe.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Survey of Cardiff (6): Principality House may set pace - The
property sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARETH GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LATER THIS summer, just off the main pedestrian shopping area of Queen
Street, Principality House, a new 62,500 sq ft office building, will be
completed at a cost of around Pounds 12m.
The development, undertaken by the Principality Building Society, could well
act as the new benchmark for Cardiff office rents.
The reason why the property sector is excited about the completion of
Principality House is that the 50,000 sq ft to be let (the rest will be
occupied by the society) could set a new high for office rents in the city.
At present, office rents are stalling at a Pounds 16.40 per square foot
high. Rents at Principality House could possibly reach Pounds 18.
Traditionally, rents in Cardiff have tended to be lower than in many other
regional centres, although prime office rents almost doubled from Pounds 8
per square foot in 1987 to Pounds 15 in 1990. A survey last year, by Knight
Frank &amp; Rutley, indicated that, while Cardiff was on a par with Newcastle
and Manchester, prime office rents in the Welsh capital were Pounds 3.20 per
square foot less than in Bristol, often used as a comparison with the city.
The property market in Cardiff has held up in the economic downturn. A
review by the property advisers Debenham Tewson showed that Cardiff had felt
the effects of recession less than cities such as Bristol and Leeds. Mr Rhys
James, a director of Debenham Tewson, said that rents in Cardiff had not
fallen during the past year.
Mr Roger Thomas, regional director of Cooke &amp; Arkwright, another of the
city's leading surveyors and estate agents, reports similar findings.
Activity in the commercial property sector has slowed over the past year,
but companies in the market for property are more selective, with continued
demand for good quality new or refurbished accommodation.
'We need to get the picture in perspective. The so-called property recession
does not compare with that of 1973-74 and 1983-84,' he said. 'Despite
short-term pressure, there are still underlying reasons for optimism about
the long-term future in Cardiff.'
The commercial property sector is predominantly office and retail space. By
the end of 1990, the city had nearly 4.5m sq ft of office space. However,
much of it consists of 1950s and 1960s buildings, which will either have to
be refurbished or pulled down in order to meet tenants' rising expectations.
New developments since the late 1980s have provided opportunities for
pioneering projects. 'Design is an important element of what contractors now
want, and there is a strong architectural tradition here,' commented Mr
Terry Hoggett, of architects Hogget Lock-Necrews, the firm which designed
Principality House.
Cardiff's property market falls into three distinct areas: the city centre;
the M4 corridor with business parks at St MelIons and Llanishen on the
outskirts of the city, and several retail projects located at Culverhouse
Cross; and the Bay area.
Rents in the centre and on the M4 corridor area are roughly the same, but it
is the Bay which could have the most impact in the long term. The
development is to be phased over a 15-year period, but the office space
allocation in the Bay area is more than 5m sq ft, rather more than Cardiff's
stock of office space at present.
However, in the city as a whole there is still a shortage of large office
units. It is a shortage that worries Mr Graham Moore, the property director
of the Welsh Development Agency:
'If we get a large company relocating and it needs 60,000 sq ft immediately,
we have got a problem. There is a window of opportunity in Cardiff, and
developers need to be encouraged to build speculative projects,' he said.
The WDA is not actively involved in the Cardiff office market. It is
concerned about the lack of institutional investment in speculative
development in the city, and the discrepancy in rents between the city and
other regional centres.
The Knight Frank &amp; Rutley report found that institutions were reluctant to
invest in Welsh office space. 'The small investment market in south-east
Wales has not yet reached the critical mass for a flourishing market to
develop,' it stated.
Mr David Swallow joined the WDA last year in a newly-created post of private
funding director. The agency hopes that its Welsh Property Venture
Initiative, which seeks generally to attract institutional money into Welsh
property, will have a spin-off effect on the Cardiff commercial sector.
Mr Swallow has found no such reluctance among the institutions to invest
heavily in the retail sector. Demand for retail property has been hit by the
general cutback in high street spending, although with a catchment area of
1.3m shoppers several new developments have come on stream. GRE Properties,
which has opened a specialist centre called the Capitol site, in the city
centre, has introduced a number of turnover rental deals, a new feature of
retail rents in South Wales.
Industrial property in Cardiff often tends to be overshadowed in what is
essentially a service city. The market was affected by the loss of land to
B1 use, and the relocation of business from parts of Cardiff Bay as that
area was prepared for redevelopment. Consequently it has been difficult to
identify trends.
Rents have been sustainable with modern units of under 3,000 sq ft reaching
between Pounds 5 and Pounds 5.50 per square foot. Medium-sized modern units
are fetching rents in excess of Pounds 4 per square foot, and larger units
around Pounds 3. Interest in the sites and units being developed in Cardiff
Bay is continuing to grow, although there are unlikely to be any mass
building programmes in the city in the immediate future.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Survey of Cardiff (3): The barrage meets its first storm -
Cardiff Bay / The future of the plan, after a parliamentary jolt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY PEOPLE describe Cardiff as a major international city waiting to
happen. After the confusion in parliament last month, the wait may be longer
than they expect.
Progress of a locally-sponsored private bill, to allow a barrage to be built
across Cardiff Bay, creating a non-tidal 500-acre freshwater lake, was
blocked at an all-night sitting. A group of Labour MPs who oppose the
scheme, largely on environmental grounds, made long speeches and raised
persistent objections.
The government says it will now take over legislation to build the barrage,
and bring in its own bill.
Without the barrage, which would cost about Pounds 80m, says the Cardiff Bay
Development Corporation, Cardiff will not be transformed into an important
maritime city. The corporation is charged with renovating and developing
2,700 acres of partly-derelict land around the bay.
Although Cardiff is the national capital of Wales, it has yet to find a new
wider role. The bay was once the port for heavy industry; but coal and steel
went into decline, and Cardiff, though still active as a port, conducts a
fraction of the business it once did. Much of the land around the bay has
fallen into disrepair. The bay itself is heavily tidal, with an average drop
of 40ft between tides. At low water, it is a vista of unattractive mud
flats.
Under Mr Peter Walker, the former secretary of state for Wales, new
industries, both British and foreign, were attracted to the valleys and
other parts of Wales. Cardiff has begun to develop as a financial centre,
servicing these industries. It has also become something of a media city,
with many independent film-production companies. But in terms of rebirth, it
trails behind such cities as Bristol and Cambridge.
Some relocation towns along the M4 have developed London-type congestion and
high costs. Cardiff, towards the end of the motorway, has not yet been
overrun by developers. Land and property were cheap, and skilled labour was
available. What was needed was for the land around the bay to be revived. In
1987, the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation was set up.
Like many of the other 10 urban development corporations, its purpose was to
rejuvenate and restore degraded acres, using government money as a catalyst.
Its plans were drawn on a grand scale: 1,000 acres of the 2,700 under its
control were considered to be immediately developable. Within 10 years, some
4m sq ft of office space and 5m sq ft of industrial factories could be
built. There would be 6,000 houses, a quarter of them social accommodation
for low-income families.
There were plans for an opera house and a maritime museum, as well as
marinas, hotels and shops; 30,000 jobs would be created directly, and up to
15,000 indirectly; around Pounds 2bn of private capital would be invested.
Cardiff would become a grand maritime city, a bit like Sydney.
The barrage across the bay was the basis for the grand design - but without
it, the mudflats were so unattractive that investors and developers would
not take the bay seriously.
Three years were put into preparing the private bill. It had to be a
parliamentary private bill, because the barrage was a single engineering
project, albeit a large one. But now the bill has now been thrown out.
What has gone wrong? In a sense, nothing. David Hunt, the present secretary
of state for Wales, has said that the government will pick up the
parliamentary bill, and make it part of its official business. With the
government whips behind it, it will almost certainly get through at some
point. But the question is: when?
Much of the opposition to the barrage was on environmental grounds. The
mudflats are the habitat of wading birds, and the bay has been designated a
site of special scientific interest. There were fears that a barrage would
cause flooding. The rivers Taff and Ely flow into the bay, and there has
been flooding in the past. A fresh-water lake would create problems with
algae, said opponents of the barrage, so that the lake would be muddy brown
rather than blue, making swimming impossible. Finally, it was suggested, the
ground water-table would be affected by a lake, so that houses would
suddenly start to develop fungus in their basements.
The seven Labour MPs, who conducted the filibuster that blocked the private
bill, emphasised these issues. But many of the criticisms have been met by
the development corporation. It says research has shown that algae can be
dealt with, as can the threat of flooding. The corporation proposes to spend
Pounds 5m to provide an alternative wildlife sanctuary for the wading birds
a few miles way. The ground-water problem is being investigated.
At bottom, the opposition of the Labour MPs ' not all of them Cardiff
members ' seemed to centre not simply on environmental problems, but on a
mix of arguments. These ranged from the view that Cardiff should become a
better capital of Wales rather than an international city, to the belief
that too many developers would make too much money out of lakeside projects.
The development board may have done itself a disservice by inadvertently
creating the impression that, without the barrage, there would be no
development around the bay.
This is not the case. So far, the private sector has invested about Pounds
250m in the bay area. The board itself has been active in infrastructural
development. It is spending money on a peripheral distributor road, which
loops off to the east and west of the M4.
Perhaps because of the time taken over the bill, it has studied other
development areas and learned from their mistakes. Unlike Southampton, say,
where the waterfront developments are divided from the old town centre,
Cardiff Bay projects will be locked on to the established city centre.
The development corporation is anxious to begin; the South Glamorgan county
council supports the barrage; Cardiff city council wants it.
The danger is that the government bill, which Mr Hunt now promises, may be a
long time coming. A general election might bring a change of government, and
the Labour party does not have the same commitment to the barrage.
Further delay could mean the difference between a piecemeal waterside
development and a dream enterprise. Opinion polls in the local press suggest
that most of the people favour the dream.
